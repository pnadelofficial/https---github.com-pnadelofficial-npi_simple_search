 No, I wasn't aware of it and I was just rereading  my 
notes earlier and last night, and there is a note 
somewhere -- I did write it down if it is important  in 
a letter, 1416011, which is 2012, where the doctor 
there is actually confirming the diagnosis and he s ays 
he encouraged me to apply for the Skipton funding. 
Even once I knew about it, actually, the initial 
payment I decided not to apply for it because at th e 
time I didn't realise what the implications would b e 
financially.  I didn't -- I wasn't in financial 
trouble at that time and I'm a bit -- I don't like the 
idea of applying for compensation for the sake of i t,
sort of thing.  I wasn't quite sure if it was 
compensation anyway but, you know, I'd raged on abo ut 
UK is going to become like America.  We're going to
demand money for, you know, falling over a pin or  7 
whatever. 
So it was, I think, a couple of years later when 
I really realised that I was struggling financially
and that it was reasonable that I receive the money
and fair and I applied for it then.  That was the 
initial one, the initial stage payment.

--Result #2--
 You've described the process as: 
"... incredibly humiliating and demeaning.  My 
feeling is if they have decided we qualify for some
kind of compensation support, they should stop maki ng 
us jump through the hoops to get it." 

--Result #3--
 Yes, I just set some thoughts out.  If you'll bea r 
with me, I'll read them. 
I'd just like to say that I do welcome this 
Inquiry as a final opportunity to seek the real tru th 
behind the contaminated blood disaster and I hope t he 
final outcome will really deliver truth and justice
where there has been none; that there will be 
recognition of the extreme pain, suffering and an 
acknowledgement of people's financial losses, which
have hugely impacted on my life and that of my fami ly  
 
 5 
and many others; the damage that's been done to my 
family life and the relationship with my child, whi ch 
has taken many years to repair and we're still tryi ng 
to get there; and it's my hope, Sir Brian, that you 'll 
re-look at Lord Peter Archer's recommendations that  he 
made in his independent report, which I was a witne ss 
to, because I think they remain arguably a most 
comprehensive set of recommendations and it would b e 
nice to see them implemented, as they should have b een 
at that time in 2009 when the report went out. 
I think most of us feel -- you know, we want -- 
every infection that we've been exposed to should b e 
taken into consideration in those recommendations i f 
we're talking about compensation proper.  You know 
hepatitis B hasn't been considered here and certain ly 
there's no word of compensation for being exposed t o 
CJD.  We're just talking at the moment about hep c and 
HIV. 
I want to see accountability for lies that have 
been told by Government officials and that even whe n 
those lies have been exposed, nothing's been done 
about them.  Those decisions have blocked justice f or 
haemophiliacs for quite some time and for people wh o 
have been infected in other ways.  I hope it does 
become clear in summarising of this Inquiry that, y ou 6 
know, as more people give evidence that this was no t 
a medical accident, it was largely avoidable.  
And I want assurances too that, you know,
certainly from Government that long-standing 
campaigners won't be blocked and left out of meetin gs, 
as we have been, because that's had a very serious 
impact.  It's certainly not a democratic process if
you exclude people, you know, that should be there and 
part of discussions because, obviously, it's affect ed 
the way that the new payment schemes and financial 
trusts were folded.  I'm referring particularly to the 
Macfarlane Trust was set up under a legal framework
and people signed to that and it was meant to be fo r 
life and widows were not meant to be means tested b ut 
that is happening and it's happening in the new 
scheme. 
I want financial security for my husband if 
I die because, you know, this new announcement with
EIBSS and victims are furious about means testing b ut,
you know, as I said, under the current rules that 
Steve won't get a penny for the loss of my life and
there's too many anomalies across the devolved 
governments which are shocking because if I'd remai ned 
living in Scotland for example, I would have been 
entitled to that scheme plus my husband would have got  7 
75 per cent of that pay-out if I lost my life.  Tha t's 
not the case here. 
Finally, I'd say that as a victim of the worst 
treatment disaster in the history of the NHS I want  to 
say to every successive Government , past and presen t,
and to the current Parliamentarians that you had, a nd
still have the responsibility to ensure justice for
every person who has been afflicted and bereaved by
a life-threatening treatment supplied by the state.
I think we're talking about, as far as I'm aware, o ver 
2,500 haemophiliacs have lost their lives and those  of 
us who are left still battling every day with the 
physical and mental damage of being infected with 
multiple viruses and having to fight for scraps of 
ex gratia  payments.  
You know, I want my pain and suffering 
recognised and it's so stressful because that delay  in 
getting justice is compounded by the anger and the 
disgust that I feel for those who have been complic it 
in covering up this blood scandal. 
I would say too finally that it's deeply, deeply 
upsetting to me that I have [redacted] in Dublin bo th 
of whom were paid out over 20 years ago by 
a government who, without any admission of liabilit y,
did accept that they had to recognise the pain and the 8 
hardship that were inflicted upon victims.  So I wo uld 
say one thing: why is my life worth so much less he re 
in the United Kingdom than [redacted] in Eire?  Tha t's 
not right.

--Result #4--
 The hepatitis C we only became aware of because 
Dr Benson had contacted us a few years back, probab ly 
about seven or eight years ago, that there was 
a Skipton Fund available, and that my mum was 
eligible, you know, to apply for that, for 
compensation payment from that.  So it was only at 
that stage that I knew that he had also had hepatit is 
C.

--Result #5--
 I do, because my stage 1 is very close to what is
stage 2.  I can totally have respect for anybody wh o 
is in stage 3, stage 4, because they are totally 
suffering different from what we are, but it is ver y 
difficult to swallow, that they can make that 
difference.  You know, it just came in the post, an d 
my wife and I couldn't understand.  This thing 
appeared in the post, that you were being offered 
this.  There was no consultation before it or 
compensation since it has been put forward.

--Result #6--
 I want to just ask you a little about the litigat ion 
in which your parents were involved on your behalf and 
the issue of financial assistance. 
Your father and mother wrote, as we've seen in 
1986, to your local MP and continued to raise matte rs 
of concern with your local MP.  One at least of tho se 
letters was passed to the then Minister for Health,
Virginia Bottomley.  If we just have up on screen t he 
response your MP received, it's 0008003.  It's 
a letter 16 November 1990 from Virginia Bottomley.  It 
is at the time of the court action, the HIV 
haemophilia litigation.  It says this: 
"Thank you for your letter of 29 October      169 enclosing one for [Mr and Mrs X] about the current 
court action concerning haemophiliacs who have 
contracted the AIDS virus.  First, there is no 
argument about the scale of the tragedy or the 
desperate plight of haemophiliacs infected with the
HIV/AIDS virus.  It's difficult to find words to 
describe the depth of the distress which both they and 
their families must be experiencing.  The Governmen t 
has never disputed our moral responsibility to pay 
attention to the needs of the victims and their 
families.  We have quite uniquely paid haemophiliac s 
with HIV at least £20,000 each to help with their 
problems and we have paid more in cases of hardship . 
We have also always promised to keep the sums 
available to the Macfarlane Trust and the needs of 
haemophiliacs under review.  Despite our promise to
keep under review the £34 million already made 
available many haemophiliacs have decided to pursue
legal proceedings alleging negligence against the l ast 
Government, the present Government, the licensing 
authorities, the health authorities, and the doctor s 
who treated them.  On the information before me, 
I have no grounds for conceding the tragedy was the
fault of the NHS or of this or previous governments ." 
She then talks about concepts of no fault      170 compensation and then if we go over the page please ,
says this: 
"There have been no substantial changes in the 
basic arguments since then.  While no fault schemes
remove the perceived unfairness between those who c an 
prove negligence and those who cannot, they create 
unfairness between those disabled as a result of a 
so-called medical accident and those who are equall y 
disabled through natural causes.  They also general ly 
result in individual claimants receiving much small er 
amounts of compensation than would be awarded throu gh 
the courts in cases where negligence could be prove d." 
Then she says this: 
"Our NHS is greatly threatened by the increase 
in the number of writs that are being issued claimi ng 
compensation for allegations of medical negligence.
The American healthcare system is being ruined by 
excessive litigation and the mounting costs of 
compensation.  It is possible to organise powerful 
emotional campaigns for many groups whose treatment
has failed to restore good health.  All medical 
treatment has an element of risk and involves 
considered judgments of those risks in the light of
current scientific knowledge. 
"I am sorry if this is a disappointing reply but      171 the Government is showing its great concern for 
haemophiliacs with HIV, by the  ex gratia  payments it 
is making.  I am afraid that the question of 
compensation has to remain a matter for the courts to 
decide if some of the haemophiliacs insist on press ing 
their legal claim to a court hearing." 
You wanted to draw that letter to the attention 
of the Inquiry and exhibited it to your statement. 
You have, I think, and you have expressed them in y our 
statement, views on the amounts of money that were or 
were not made available to individuals through the 
ex gratia  payments scheme?

--Result #7--
 Okay.  One of the things I do need to say, it doe s 
relate to the potential consequences of the Inquiry
itself.  
It's pretty much been established that the 
Government keeps saying that it doesn't really want  to 
pay out compensation.  So I just want to put it on 
record that the Government seems to have a financia l 
incentive not to pay out to us because their curren t 
situation in all the schemes is if we die, the way 
they've written the stipulations the payouts stop.  So 
essential it's better for them if they wait for us to 
die. 
That can't be allowed to continue.  If there is      192 going to be any kind of whether you call it 
compensation or whether you don't call it compensat ion 
and they just raise the support payments, they have  to 
make -- someone has to make it so that they're not 
allowed to only deliver them to the people that are
still alive because, while they only have to pay ou t 
to people who are still alive, they can always keep
refusing to pay it hoping that we'll die off so tha t 
they can save money.  It has to be paid out in the 
names of the victims that have died as well, to the
next of kin of those victims and the families that 
were also immensely damaged.  I know their deed sai d 
in the Macfarlane Trust's deed that those people we re 
supposed to be being supported every bit as much as  we 
were as primary infected (in my case, kids) but 
infected haemophiliacs. 
Someone needs to clarify that it's not okay for 
you only to support the ones that are still alive 
because when the victims have died, their families are 
devastated, they are going through financial hardsh ip 
as well as the grief but the Government is saying, We
don't need to support them anymore, that person die d,
cross-them off the list, their life doesn't matter.
The fact that they were killed doesn't matter.  To 
hell with them.      193 That can't be allowed to carry on.  So whatever 
is done must include widows -- there's a major prob lem 
around where there were parents because they didn't
necessarily call them widows, so parents weren't 
really thought of within the schemes in a way.  The re 
were some payments that some widows could get acces s 
to through the MFT, but they were minuscule, but th ere 
were no categories for parents, even though many of  us 
were children when we were infected and when we die d 
when we were young, they will always be classed as 
your next of kin, and yet there was no category to 
help them. 
So whatever happens in the compensation system,
it has to include the families of those that have d ied 
in the name of the person who was infected and who has 
died, because otherwise the Government still has 
a financial incentive not to pay out because it's j ust 
waiting for us to die off to reduce how much it cos ts. 
It's just not right.

 Means testing.  What has my wife's income got to do
with the fact that I am again a haemophiliac, who i s 
HIV positive, who is hep C positive and CJD positiv e?
It's got nothing to do with my wife.  Why should sh e 
have less money -- what they are saying is, "Your w ife 
can pay the money that we would pay you.  So go to her 
and ask her for about £250 a month that we used to pay 
you under the old scheme, because she earns too muc h 
to give you it.  So just get £250,000 a month from 
her, will you?" 
So if you think about this in practice, you 
know -- I won't get into the nitty-gritty of my 
marital financial arrangements -- but in practice 
again it's a simple thing, isn't it?  If it were al l 
cash, you'd go to your wife and say, "Oh, you know you 
were having that spa treatment and that night out w ith 
the girls and movie night?  Well, you're not anymor e, 
because you have got to give me now £250 because 
they're not giving me it.  So you have to have 
a lesser lifestyle to look after me, this guy who h as 
been a burden on you for the last 35 years of your 
life".6 Now I am a bigger burden.  I am a financial 
burden.  Why?  Why is it?  Then the EIBSS have the 
nerve -- how they have the information I don't know
but they say, "Oh, by the way we have looked up.  Y ou 
are now getting a special category mechanism paymen t, 
aren't you? 
So you are actually, financially, you are 
significantly better off than you were under the ol d 
scheme when we kind of aggregated all your payments ". 
I said, "Yes, because I am a lot damn sicker than 
I was to qualify for that special category mechanis m 
payment.  It is not something you have just decided  to 
give me.  I had to go through another load of hoops  to 
get that and you rejected that the first time".  It  is 
just bizarre. 
The thing is they all call it, you know, 
assistance, entitlements, benefit.  We all think it
should be compensation, but it is not compensation and 
it should be compensation.  It's been a tough 30-od d 
years living with this.  It is not our fault and we
are actually made to feel like beggars panhandling our 
way through life and the way you are treated -- aga in,
right now I have just qualified for some -- for tra vel 
costs to go to hospital.  Now, I hadn't applied for
this before, because, again, it is another type of7 discretionary payment.  It is in the booklet but th ere 
is two types of discretionary payment.  God knows w hy. 
This one -- so I said -- I mean, they were 
pestering me for two years to apply for this 
discretionary payment that I didn't qualify for. 
I told them on the phone "I have looked at your 
booklet.  I don't qualify for it." 
"Oh, apply anyway", they said.  They were really 
touchy-feely on the phone.  "We need to know how th e 
community is affected by our new rules.  Would he w ant 
your feedback".  I said, "Okay.  I am not going to 
fill it in because I don't qualify.  I am not going  to 
get a load of pay slips but I'll send it in".  They
said, "Send us a covering letter.  Explain your 
circumstances.  It has been very interesting talkin g 
to you, Mr [redacted].

--Result #9--
 Okay.  All right.  Well, if you can't assist us any
further, obviously then you can't. 
If we then go to HSOC0029476_058, we can see 
it's an Executive Committee meeting on 1 March '86.
We just need to look at the last paragraph on this 
page, please.  You'll see there under the heading 
"Compensation": 
"The Chair reported that further steps had been 
taken in connection with pursuing the question of 
compensation for those who had come into contact wi th 
HTLV-III virus.  Executive Committee noted that act ion 
against pharmaceutical companies had been abandoned  in 
the USA by the National Haemophilia Foundation.  Th e 
Executive Committee agreed unanimously that the mat ter  
71 of compensation should be pursued on an urgent basi s.
The importance of not raising the expectations of 
members was stressed since the issue could take yea rs 
to resolve with no guarantee of the outcome." 
Really, I wanted to ask you using this as 
a spring board, Mr Watters, just to provide us with
an overview of the steps that The Haemophilia Socie ty 
took following the decision here by the Executive 
Committee to pursue the matter of compensation on 
an urgent basis.  The steps The Haemophilia Society
took in pursuit of that objective, what can you tel l 
us about the steps taken? 

--Result #10--
 We can take that document down.  Before I show you 
a few further documents and ask for your comment on
them, you have referred in your statement, I think,  to 
meeting ministers or MPs, to discuss issues of                                     
 
                      3 compensation on a number of occasions.  You touched
then on meeting with John Moore.  I think your 
statement refers to meetings with Kenneth Clarke an d 
with Edwina Currie.  Can you recall any more detail
about any of those?

--Result #11--
 So, this is the annual report from 1986 and if we g o 
to page 8, we can see from the top of the page it 
says: 
"It is clear from the advice we have received  
75 from Counsel that there is no case that the Society
can pursue on behalf of our members, either 
corporately or individually.  As each individual's 
circumstances are different it would be necessary f or 
them to discuss their particular position with 
a solicitor before it can be established whether it  is 
worth pursuing such an action through the Courts. 
While we sought this advice generally, and not base d 
on any particular set of personal circumstances, we
have to say that, on present known facts and upon o ur 
judgment of the advice we received, the prospect of
the majority of claims succeeding is remote.  There
are two importance reasons for this: the difficulty  of 
proving negligence and the difficulty of identifyin g 
the proper body or person from whom compensation mi ght 
be sought." 
Now, the purpose of showing you that at this 
stage, Mr Watters, is just to understand that, is t his 
right, in the course of 1986, is this correct, the 
Society sought advice from counsel about whether it ,
the Society, could bring a legal claim and the advi ce 
it received was that it would be unlikely to be abl e 
to do so; is that correct?

--Result #12--
 I'm going to pick that up in the very next document ,
just to understand what it was the Society was sayi ng 
publicly and to Government about the issues of 
compensation.  If we go to HCDO0000279_025, this is
Haemofact 13 from May 1987, and if we go over to th e 
second page, it says at the top: 
"Members of the Society have asked for 
a statement of the Society's position regarding 
compensation for people with haemophilia who have 
become HIV positive as a result of receiving 
contaminated blood products." 
We can see there the Society's position was 
that people with haemophilia who are HIV positive 
deserve special financial support from the Governme nt,
and then you refer in the next paragraph to the 
Government having a clear moral duty to provide 
recompense, and you make the observation about the 
extent of the problem would have been considerably 
reduced if successive governments had honoured thei r                                     
 
                      7 pledges to make the UK self-sufficient and if steps
had been taken sooner to screen donations and 
heat-treat products. 
Then you go over, two paragraphs further down: 
"We are now able to give more details of how we 
can pursue our claim against the Government." 
If we look at "The Next Move", down the bottom 
of the page, you see the Society sets the various 
steps it's going to take persuading the Government to 
pay a special financial benefit, the Society will b e 
holding a meeting with MPs: 
"We will then formally call upon the Government 
to pay a special weekly benefit ..." 
Further detail is there provided.  We go to the 
next page, there's a paragraph at the top "Winning 
Support", and that talks about Simon Taylor and 
Dr Peter Jones appearing on television programmes 
calling for action from the Government, and it refe rs 
to there being essentially a media campaign and 
political campaign rallying MPs. 
Then under the next heading, "We Need Your 
Help", it asks for members to write to the Society in 
confidence so that hard evidence can be presented. 
This is obviously a description of the position 
as at 1987.  Does this broadly, accurately describe 
78 the decision and steps that the Society had decided  to 
undertake to try and secure compensation from the 
Government? 

--Result #13--
 Correct, and we were immediately discouraged from 
using the word "compensation" and instead using the
word "recompense" because compensation would imply 
liability.

--Result #14--
 If we then look at HSOC0003459, you will see there,
Mr Watters, it's a document, "AIDS, Haemophilia and
the Government, A submission from The Haemophilia 
Society calling for financial provision for people 
with haemophilia infected with the AIDS virus", 
October 1987, and if we go over the page we can see
"AIDS, Haemophilia and the Government, Summary". 
I want to pick it up in the third and fourth and fi fth 
paragraphs, it says this: 
"We are asking the Government to help restore 
the quality of life of people with haemophilia and HIV 
infection. 
"At Government's suggestion the Society has 
already explored the question of redress through th e 
legal system and has been advised that claims for 
compensation as such are most unlikely to succeed 
because of the difficulty of proving negligence.  I n 
any case, the Society is advised that any solution  
79 which may be provided by the courts will not be 
available in the short term.  However, the needs of
families are immediate.  
"The Society is therefore looking to Government 
as the only available source of support, recognitio n 
and recompense." 
There are two questions I wanted to ask you 
about that, Mr Watters.  The first is this appears to 
say that it was the Government which suggested that
the Society explore the question of legal redress.  Is 
that right and, if so, who in Government proposed i t?

--Result #15--
 If we go to HSOC0023111, you will see here, 
Mr Watters, it's a letter -- I don't think this one  is 
dated but there's a letter to Dr Aronstam, which we 'll 
look at in a moment, which is dated January 1987.  In 
any event, this is to Professor Bloom: 
"Dear Arthur 
"In strictest confidence 
"I enclose a copy of the provisional Opinion 
which we have received from the barrister involved in 
looking at the legal case for compensation in respe ct 
of people with haemophilia.  I also enclose a short
commentary on that which I have extracted.  It is 
essential that you regard both documents in the ver y 
strictest confidence and do not discuss them with 
anyone apart from the named recipients who appear a t 
the end of this letter." 
We can see the recipients are Dr Aronstam, 
Dr Rizza, Dr Colvin and Dr Forbes and, if we go ove r                                     
 
                      1 the page, we can see a letter in similar terms, not
identical, dated 29 January 1987 from you to 
Dr Aronstam, again enclosing a copy of the provisio nal 
opinion and your commentary.  You say you're sendin g 
the documents to him in particular, since he's 
involved in some capacity with the Merseyside case 
and, again, you ask for it not to be discussed with
anyone other than the recipients of the letter. 
Now, why was it that the Society decided to 
share its opinion, which suggested that litigation 
would not be easy to achieve, with members of the 
Medical Advisory Panel, or with the specific 
clinicians named here, I should say? 

--Result #16--
 It might be thought somewhat odd that a society 
representing individual members trying to do its be st 
to get compensation or recompense for individual  
82 members would share its negative advice about the 
prospect of litigation with those who might, as it 
were, end up being on the other side of that 
litigation.  Do you have any comment on that? 

--Result #17--
 If we then go to HCDO0000276_407, please.  This is 
a Haemophilia Society publication update, June 1989 ,
so I've moved on towards the end of the 1980s.  And  if 
we can look at the article headed "Compensation 
questions" it says there: 
"Later in the year, the Society will be 
launching a new campaign designed to achieve an 
out-of-court settlement of compensation from the 
Government.  This announcement was made by the gene ral 
secretary [that's you] on Newsnight on 6 June 1989.
"The Society is no stranger to campaigning on 
issues affecting people with haemophilia.  In 
November '87, the Society led a campaign resulting in 
the establishment of the Macfarlane Trust, funded b y 
the Government with a grant of £10 million.  This f und 
is unique not only in the UK but the whole of Europ e. 
"At the same time, we investigated the legal 
position of claims for compensation.  Our advice at 
83 that time had to be that cases should proceed on an
individual basis.  Some 250 individuals have starte d 
actions during the last two years.  The Society has
now reviewed the situation, and it's our belief tha t 
the Government must recognise the need for 
compensation now, rather than in five to ten years'
time." 
Then if we look at the bottom of that column,
"What should do now?": 
"We believe that infection through medicinal 
products is one which both demands and deserves 
compensation.  There is strength in numbers, and it  is 
therefore important that everyone who is considerin g 
a claim should register this intention by consultin g 
a lawyer.  We can let you have the name and address  of 
the lawyer nearest to you ..." 
I just want to understand the chronology that 
emerges from the documents, Mr Watters, and you can
tell me, please, if I'm wrong. 
The first compensation or recompense campaign 
that we looked at a few minutes ago resulted in or 
perhaps came to an end when the Government provided
the £10 million fund that was provided to the Socie ty 
and led to the initial establishment of the 
Macfarlane Trust.

--Result #18--
 Can I ask you to look next at just a handful of 
further documents relating to the issue of 
compensation and campaigning. 
If we could go to RFLT0000004.  This is 
a letter from you, dated 24 October 1990.  It's an 
urgent letter to all Society members from the gener al  
91 secretary.  It refers in the first paragraph to med ia 
speculation about the possibility of an out-of-cour t 
settlement.  In the second paragraph, you say: 
"It's being implied that negotiations are 
taking place between lawyers representing both 
sides -- i.e. your lawyers and the Government 
lawyers -- to establish an acceptable out-of-court 
settlement.  The Haemophilia Society is not and can not 
be involved in those negotiations.  If they are tak ing 
place, they are being held between the lawyers."
Then the next paragraph refers to settlement 
figures reported in the press being speculative.  T hen 
you say this: 
"The role of the Society throughout has been to 
make it politically expedient for the Government to
settle our case out of court now rather than in thr ee 
or four years' time.  The other point, of course, i s 
that money paid out now is guaranteed, whereas ther e 
is certainly no guarantees associated with the fina l 
outcome of the legal case." 
What was the purpose of writing this letter and 
what in particular did you mean by the Society's ro le 
being to make it politically expedient for the 
Government to settle the case out of court? 

--Result #19--

Every civil servant and every minister that 
we
 spoke
to.  So
, 
for
 
example
 
and I think I cite, this was
repeatedly
 -- if 
this was raised in Parliament, the
ministerial replies would always be
 "
compensation is
a matter for the courts
"
.

--Result #20--

The paragraph then goes on to say that:
"
... [
the Society
]
 has been advised that claims
for compensation as such 
are
 most unlikely to succeed
because of the difficulty of proving negligence.  In
 
36
any case
, 
the Society is advised that any solution
which may be provided by the courts will not be
available in the short term.  However, the needs of
families 
are
 immediate."
What was 
the
 thinking behind putting in
a submission to the Government
, 
the fact that the
Society had received negative legal advice
?

If we could have 
the -- some
 minutes 
that
 we've got of
a meeting of the Hepatitis Task Group
,
 please
.
 
62
Soumik it's HSO
C
0003289.
These 
are
 minutes from 16 September, and there
seem to have been three key points addressed.
Firstly
, 
the second paragraph
:
"
It was agreed 
..."
I think it should say
:
"
... [
after
]
 careful consideration that while
there 
did not
 appear to be a basis for a generalised
compensation campaign on the basis of presently held
information
, this should be kept under close review
both in this country and with other WFH NMOs
throughout 
the
 world."
Then secondly, under "Possible future
activities":
"It was agreed that the most valuable 
roles
which could be provided by the Society lay in the
provision of accurate and up to the minute advice and
information
 and an
 
ongoing lobby to ensure the very
best levels of treatment and care of people with
haemophilia and hepatitis in any/all its form along
with support for those who 
are
 and 
become
 ill."
Then finally
, 
towards the end of the page:
"The meeting then went on to discuss
recommendation
s
 for a Hepatitis Awareness Campaign for
[People With Haemophilia
].  
After discussion a format
 
63
was agreed whereby a series of meetings could be held
at seven 
venues throughout 
the
 UK where medical and
legal aspects of hepatitis would be presented ..."
When
 it's 
mentioned
 that there would be legal
aspects of hepatitis, what 
was
 that referring to?

--Result #22--

Going back to the very first point on the minutes, the
point that there didn't appear to be a basis for
a generalised compensation campaign, why was that the
view of the group?

--Result #23--

It says in the second and third paragraphs
 
that:
"The vast majority of people have had the
condition for some decades, 
are
 
well
, and every
 
70
indication is that they will remain so.  A small
proportion have had severe problems, and we 
are
 taking
all appropriate measures to ensure that those affected
have the maximum amount of 
information
 and the best
possible care.
"We have 
no
 plans to seek compensation from the
government, our priority is to ensure help and support
for people 
who
 
are
 unwell as a result of hepatitis C."
Is there a connection between those
two
 paragraphs?  And by that, I mean in the second
paragraph there is a discussion that it's only going
to affect a small proportion of people
, 
only
 "
a small
proportion 
[
will have
]
 severe problems
"
, and in the
next, it indicates that there are 
"
no
 plans to seek
compensation
"
.  Was it the case that the Society
wasn't seeking compensation because of the belief that
it was only going to affect a small --

--Result #24--

No, absolutely not.  The fact that
, 
you know, even if
had
 only been a very small number of people and
 -- you
know, 
we would have acted on their behalf.  I don't
recall quite why we said 
we
 had 
no
 plans to seek
compensation from the Government
, 
and shortly
thereafter
 
we started campaigning for financial
 
71
support.  I have a 
feeling
 that this press release
,
and indeed there's another document a few days later,
which is a motion passed at our council, was in
response to some specific 
high
 profile media story
,
but
 -- 
I don't recall specifically but that's my sense
of it.

Why 
did

Having told the Department of Health in December
 
74
in an informal meeting
, 
and indeed
,
 
as you say
, 
in the
press release, that you were not seeking compensation
,
at what stage 
did
 
you
 then go back to them and say,
"We 
are
 seeking financial help"?

--Result #27--

In relation to the decision to openly say to
Government that there 
were 
poor prospects of success
on a compensation -- on litigation in relation to HIV,
who made that tactical decision to say that
?

--Result #28--

When we were discussing the HIV litigation, we
discussed whether the concerns about supply of
concentrates influenced the Society's position on
litigation.  Could we look at HSO
C
0029476_061, please
,
and could we go to page 3.
At the top of the page, "Compensation claims",
we see
: 
"[
The World Federation of Haemophilia
]
 had also
circulate
d
 a paper advising against the pursuit of
 
92
compensation claims.  This resolution had its base in
the 
[
US
]
 where it was feared that actions brought
against individual pharmaceutical companies could lead
to a 
'
drying up
'
 of the concentrate supply.  Since it
was felt that action against companies in the UK 
was
only one option -- and perhaps the least likely to
succeed -- it was suggested that we should reserve our
position by voting against the resolution.  This 
was
proposed by Mr Taylor, seconded by Mr Knight and
agreed unanimously."
Do you recall this meeting and this resolution?

--Result #29--
 If we look at a set of minutes of the Board of 
Trustees discussing this, it's MACF0000002_020, 
please, Soumik.  You'll see, Mr Stevens, if we look
that these are the minutes of a extraordinary meeti ng 
of the trustees held at Alliance House on 
29 November 1989, and if we look at the bottom of t he 
page, you'll see reference there: 
"On ... 21 November, the Trust and The 
Haemophilia Society had been invited to a meeting w ith 
the Secretary of State ... scheduled for 12.45 on 
23 November.  No detailed agenda or papers have bee n 
provided in advance of the meeting." 
If we go to the next page, if you look at the 
top half of the page, you can see: 
"At the meeting it quickly became clear that 
the Trust and the Society had been invited to be to ld 
the Government's intentions only just in advance of
an official parliamentary statement and press relea se  
22 ... There had therefore been no negotiation and ver y 
limited scope for discussion, though the views of t he 
Trust and the Society had been firmly presented to the 
extent that the draft statement and press release h ad 
been modified in some areas. 
"The Secretary of State had made it clear that 
the Government did not intent to alter its position
that compensation must be handled by the Courts and
hence that the proposed payment was not a settlemen t 
or compensation payment." 
Then there's a reference to the chair, on 
behalf of The Haemophilia Society, saying this was 
just the beginning.  Then if we go further down,
there's reference to the Secretary of State being 
asked why the Government didn't make the payments 
itself: 
"... the response was that using the Trust was 
necessary ... to give ... concessions on tax and 
social security payments. 
"The Government proposal was to pay the Trust 
£19 million and for the Trust to provide the balanc e 
and be later reimbursed." 
I don't know what, if any, recollection you 
have of these events, Mr Stevens, but it would appe ar 
from this that the Macfarlane Trust had little adva nce  
23 notice or little advance involvement in the 
Government's planning and its announcement of this 
payment of £19 million.  Is that your recollection?

--Result #30--
 Now, an issue then arose as to whether receipt of t he 
£20,000 payment should be taken into account by the
Macfarlane Trust when it was considering applicatio ns 
for assistance.  And if we look at MACF0000002_022,
please Soumik, we can see there these are the minut es 
of a trustees' meeting on 22 March 1990.  If we go to 
page 7, please, you'll see there, Mr Stevens, under
the heading "Allocation policy" a heading "The 
implications of the £20,000  ex gratia  payment", and 
there is then a debate about whether the  ex gratia 
payment should be taken into account when assessing
applications for grants.  If we go to the top of th e 
next page, we look at first paragraph: 
"The final majority view is that no direct 
account should be taken of the  ex gratia  payment in 
assessing grants by the Trust, and this was seen as  a
continuation of the existing policy.  At the same 
time, it was recognised that it would be difficult to  
30 guarantee that trustees' awareness of the grant cou ld 
be entirely set aside, and hence may affect their v iew 
of some requests for assistance such as mortgages o r 
house improvements." 
So that was the view taken by the Board.  Your 
own view is what I wanted to ask you about, 
Mr Stevens, and that requires us to look at 
a different document.  It is HSOC0013492, please.
This is an exchange of correspondence between 
you and Mr Watters of The Haemophilia Society.  If we 
go to the third page, please, Soumik, we can see yo ur 
letter.  And if we look at the first half of the pa ge 
to start with, you refer in the second paragraph to
the letter having been discussed at the trustees' 
meeting.  Those are the minutes I think we just loo ked 
at.  Then you say in the third paragraph: 
"In my opinion, as I told my fellow trustees,
the £20,000  ex gratia  payment cannot and indeed should 
not be excluded from our consideration of future 
requests for financial help from the Trust.  In man y 
cases it will not be relevant; but as I have expres sed 
to you in connection with the campaign as a whole, I
believe that with scarce resources we must be prepa red 
to discriminate in favour of those in most need and
the £20,000 payment is an obvious factor in helping  to  
31 determine such need." 
You go on to say that: 
"Clearly £20,000 cannot be considered 
sufficient compensation [underlined] -- nothing can ,
and you know that this is said with personal 
experience." 
Then you talk, in that and the following 
paragraph, of different degrees of disadvantage, an d 
you say in the following paragraph: 
"... the family men, or their surviving widows 
and families, remain in general in need of assistan ce, 
and it is to them that I feel the Trust should give
priority. 
"I shall continue to urge my fellow Trustees,
therefore, to take into account the  ex gratia  payment 
when considering applications received from those w ho 
fall, for example, into the first two groups 
I describe, in order that we can be more effective in 
our help to others on whom the burden of HIV infect ion 
falls even more severely.  It is, of course, possib le 
that we shall not receive many applications from th ose 
former groups, in which case the issue will rarely 
arise ..." 
Two questions, Mr Stevens.  The first is: why 
was it, in a nutshell, your view that the £20,000  
32 should be taken into account, at least in some case s? 

--Result #31--
 Another early decision was about not campaigning.  And 
if we look at MACF0000002_019, these are the minute s 
of a meeting 20 November 1989.  If we go to page 3,
please, under the heading "The compensation campaig n": 
"Discussion on this subject was wide ranging 
but mainly centred on two aspects of Trust policy,
namely what part, if any, should the Trust play in the 
campaign, and, secondly, what position should the 
Trust take if offered any large  sum of money by th e 
Government. 
"On the first point, it was generally agreed 
that the position which had been maintained to that
date (that the Macfarlane Trust and its work were 
separate from the issue of compensation) was correc t 
and should be continued.  It was also agreed that 
while the Trust could not entirely avoid being draw n 
into the public arena on this subject, it should no t 
take any initiatives or active part in the campaign . 
At the same time, the Trust should take care to avo id 
any action or statement would which impede the 
campaign." 
That, as I understand it, was a view which 
again the Trust maintained during the period when y ou 
were Chair, that it would not become involved in 
campaigning.  Why was that?  
43 
--Result #32--
 Do you know why the Society was campaigning for 
compensation for those with hepatitis C, why those with 
hepatitis B were excluded?  
127 
--Result #33--
 I think -- I don't know how far you want to go into
this at the moment, but I think the -- there were 
three options which were in the first actuarial pap er                                     
 
                                |  93 which were viable ones, and one which we supported was 
the one about significant compensation being paid t o 
the beneficiaries rather than continuing with the 
existing financial relationship with them.  And it 
frightened the Department, I think, and it got buri ed 
really, sadly.

--Result #34--
 No.  Everybody was always very welcoming to me and 
kind and I didn't experience any of that feeling 
whatsoever.  I think that what was felt, that peopl e 
had to, sort of -- that registrants felt they 
shouldn't have been in a position where they had to
ask a charity for, you know, small sums of money, f or 
example, to buy a washing machine or, you know, the y 
felt that it was demeaning, and it was.  It was  
23 demeaning.  The Government should have actually giv en 
them -- paid proper compensation at the time.

--Result #35--
 No, it's all right.7 You know, just going back to what I was saying 
about, you know, what's gone on over the years and 
I think, you know, it's been 33 years from the date
from when I was infected with HIV, 39 years from my
first hepatitis infection and, as far as I'm 
concerned, the Government has been given far too lo ng 
avoiding paying proper compensation for killing peo ple 
and ruining people's lives and prospective careers and 
just wrecking your life.
I know the Inquiry's going to be two years but,
you know, it's just going to be another two years o f 
being tormented, you know.  Department of Health ha ve 
everybody in the palm of their hand with the fundin g 
and these schemes and stuff like that, where they 
haven't come out and guarantee anything, you know.  As 
far as I'm concerned, they can pull it off us if th ey 
wanted to and what would we do then?
As far as I'm concerned the buck stops with the 
Government and it's time they acknowledged this by 
admitting liability.  There's enough proof out ther e 
now that this should never have happened, any of it . 
That's basically it. 
I'd like to thank Sir Brian and the Inquiry team 
for the opportunity to do this, and Collins for 
getting us to this point and all the support they g ive8 us.  Without them, we would all still be at home 
kicking the cat!  Not really, not really!

--Result #36--
 I knew it was due to campaigning from I think it wa s 
a haemophilia group in Scotland.  So I knew it was due 
to pressure from campaign groups on the Government to 
obviously offer some compensation or recognition of
what had happened to these people.

--Result #37--
   We looked yesterday morning, Mr Fish, at a docume nt 
called the Ross Report, which was a report to the 
Scottish Executive in March 2003, so before you joi ned 
the Skipton Fund and, indeed, before the Skipton Fu nd 
itself was set up, which made certain recommendatio ns 
that were for compensation rather than the specific
ex gratia payments that the Skipton Fund ultimately
made.  Do you recall any discussions about that rep ort 
or about the principle of compensation versus ex 
gratia payments when you were at the Skipton Fund?

--Result #38--
 I had heard of the Ross Report, but I didn't know t hat 
there was discussion about whether or not it should  be 
compensation or ex gratia payment.

--Result #39--
   Then if we could go to SKIP0000030_009, so these are 
the minutes of the Board of Directors, February 201 4.
If we go to page 4, please, if you look at the 
paragraph that bears the number 168 next to it, so it 
is towards the top of the page:
"Exclusion of applicants who have already been 
compensated for their HCV infection through the NHS .
"The Scheme Administrator reported that the DH 
had indicated in a recent telephone call that it wa s 
their intention to exclude people from the scheme w ho 
had already received compensation for hepatitis C  
88 infection through litigation.  At the moment it was
unclear if this would be limited to future applican ts 
being asked to confirm that they had not already be en 
compensated, or include existing applicants who wer e 
receiving regular payments." 
Then it refers to you having submitted some 
draft wording on the application form and guidance 
notes to the Department of Health and Department of
Health lawyers now considering it. 
Can you recall how that issue was resolved, 
Mr Fish?

--Result #40--
 In about 2002 you think your Mum applied for mone y 
from the Skipton fund and, again, in her records 
there's a letter from Professor Ludlam to her GP 
saying your Mum had been to see him and she had bee n 
told by the Scottish Office that compensation would
only be given if infection occurred after March 198 8. 
Were you aware of that at the time?  

--Result #41--
 Okay, sorry. 
So that allowed me then to work out who may 
still be under active review or any other family 
members, and we discussed it at that time with the 
team.  So the team at that time had been -- the 
established team that been there for some time and had 
also worked along with Dr Mayne and Dr Anderson dur ing 
that time-frame, so their information was very help ful 
and supportive of it.  So for those patients that w e 
had active still on our list, should it be a grands on 
or a daughter, those patients were contacted in an 
appropriate way with regards to the change in the 
Skipton and to say that we believed or I believed t hat 
there was information that we would have that we wo uld 
be able to help them and to support them in their 
application for their part 1. 
The challenge, though, with regards to anything 
beyond the part 1, particularly for part 2 
application, is the paperwork in order to prove 
evidence.  And the commonest way that this is only 
ever applicable or available is if it's noted actua lly                                   
 
                           05 on the death certificate.  Medical records for thos e 
patients were not always available, or were not 
available, unless there happened to be miscellaneou s 
letters within the filing cabinet pertaining to tho se 
individuals.  So we approached families and we 
encouraged them to come up.  It was really very 
difficult.  I think that -- I remember one occasion ,
a mother coming up in relation to her son, and I fo und 
the consultation challenging in talking to her abou t 
her son because he was only a few years older than 
what I was, and I just kind of felt that no matter 
what the compensation or whatever the money may hav e 
been, what this woman wanted was her son, and for m e 
to come, 20 years after he had died, it was just 
not -- it was just not good.  Sorry.  She's never - - 
she's never left me.  Just ... 
So as far as possible we went through it.  It 
was a very difficult time for many families.  I jus t 
felt, to sit there in front of these exceptionally 
dignified people, and for me to offer them a bit of
paper to sign, and that I'd sign my bit, and that t hey 
would get a cheque, it was just awful. 
So it was really a pivotal moment, I think, for 
me professionally.  But they were so good.  You kno w,
I got a thank you letter or they thanked me afterwa rds  
106 for absolutely nothing, absolutely nothing.
Just ... a total waste.  Sorry. 

--Result #42--
 I've written some words, over 30 years I've had som e 
thoughts about how things should go. 
So, the three things that have kept me campaigning:
my friends, the scandal, and hope. 
My friends, it is our story I've tried to tell. 
I've built the case initially, as we all did, on ch ats, 
noting not only the incongruous elements in our 
experiences, but the incredible similarities which 
showed the co-ordination of events from Centre to 
Centre.  The lack of honesty with patients and pare nts 
about risks, about infections, the lack of  
211 responsibility and the attempts to avoid the realit y of 
what was to happen by doctors and State. 
This is what brought us together.  Friendships grew
from tragedy.  I remember when I last saw my friend
Haydn Lewis, over a decade ago now.  We had just 
descended en masse to Westminster, as we did for ye t 
another debate.  He was two weeks from death: bald,
chemotherapy, thin, yellow.  His voice was weak as 
thread.  I remember saying: "What the fuck are you doing 
here, mate?"
I cuddled him.  I gently hugged what was a frail 
body.  He said: "I'm here to break the law.  It's 
illegal to die in Westminster."
The scandal.  We built a language commonly used by 
all scandals.  Haydn, he used to say it was importa nt to 
focus on the nice things.  
The worst is I asked him (inaudible) in the history
of the NHS, and I'm sorry, Lord Winston, it was me that 
put those words into your mouth.  
"Infected and affected" was me, because we were 
finding it hard to describe the broader impacts. 
We now take for granted those words.  We inherited 
the label "campaigners".  But I want ... (inaudible ).
We were, and those of us that still are, patients 
with questions.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  The  
212 reasoned request of damned souls.  We were forced b y 
scandal to fight just to exist.  Forced to go to la w.
Forced to become researchers, lobbyists, interview 
subjects, to declare our illness publicly in life w ith 
no good choices, just stark realities of fold or fi ght. 
Our campaign was built on decades of research, an 
activity that once allowed me to pick up my phone b ook 
and ring a list of numbers to check my work.  Now, in 
common with the few that are left, of those two 
long-term battlers.  I carry the weight of the lost . 
All those promises I made to dying comrades and 
friends, and that we'd carry on.  And we did, and w e do. 
So as I frequently do have to ask, what is my task 
now?  To ensure I truly honour the fallen.  Those g hosts 
of friends, those irretractible promises that I wou ld 
see the fight through to the end. 
Hope.  I have hope for this Inquiry.  First, there 
is a need for appropriate memorials.  I feel that t he 
Inquiry's report must be crowned by the unveiling o f 
memorials in each of the UK's capital cities in a p lace 
of prominence, supported by governments willing to 
acknowledge responsibility in the most traditional way.
A formal recognition of apology to those whom they did 
not give justice to in life. 
Secondly, there is a need for support.  We must                                   
 
                             13 ensure that those who are left are supported in the  most 
complete way possible, to enable them to take full 
control of their lives, and make the best they can of 
what they have left, in the most complete terms. 
Families of the living and the dead have been made 
victims too, by the State's treatment of their love d 
ones. 
As things stand, the State bears a responsibility t o 
make good the damages and losses.  And no one shoul d be 
worse off at the end of a decent compensation proce ss. 
But ultimately, how do we make sense of such death 
and suffering on an industrial scale? 
Thirdly, there needs to be needs for recognition, i n 
my view, that can only come from significant change  in 
how we understand the concept of pioneers within 
medicine.  And that needs to change to the patient being 
the pioneer. 
It is only the patient and his loved ones that will
truly suffer medical failure.  This must be recogni sed. 
All new medicines must have compensation rights 
automatically written into them.  Any trials should
automatically be insured.  Funds should be establis hed 
to make sure those responsible for medical products , be 
they the States or commercial entities, can be held
liable, and will have the money for all losses crea ted  
214 without having to plunder medical budgets or decima te 
other people's lives in return.  It should not be 
a trade-off. 
Fourthly, there needs to be honest incentives for 
honest disclosure of adverse events.  From the 
individual practitioner whose mistake should be lea rnt 
from, but also disclosed, in order to inform teachi ng 
practices of others, to drug companies who may need  more 
punitive encouragement.  We need a system where doc tors 
can declare their mistakes.  Maybe it will cost the m 
retraining limitations in their practice, but hones tly, 
should not be seen primarily as a threat to end the ir 
career, but as a means to improve and inform practi ce 
across the profession. 
Dishonesty can only, and certainly has, immeasurabl y 
compound harms caused from such events. 
Fifthly, we need to protect the children.  In 
long-term conditions like haemophilia, the child mu st be 
enabled thoroughly, by being offered the broadest 
possible support from genetic assessment, beyond th e 
headline conditions, the dramatic haemophilia.
Frequently they missed the autism, the heart diseas e, 
the other things. 
Child development must be a feature.  Stronger 
nursing positions must be a feature.  Physio,  
215 occupational therapy, psychological support, social
work, educational input, tailored to the needs of e ach 
child so that the medical burden is answerable with  the 
possibility of empowerment. 
Finally, I want to end by offering this most public
apology to my wife and children.  No family should ever 
see their husband or father figure trench in the fr ont 
living room and go to war with the State, but I hav e 
hope of a ladder from my trench to mental peace.  I  can 
only hope you understand that I had to stand for th ose 
who fell, or are falling.  My comrades, my friends,  my 
blood brothers, my sisters. 
I commend my work to the Inquiry and hope it 
continues to be to the fullest -- I hope it contrib utes 
to the fullest understanding of the simplest of 
questions.  What were haemophiliacs for? 
Thank you.

 Yeah.  That was the original objective -- and/or if  we 
can't get one, let's go to court.  And we ended up 
doing it both ironically. 
Once the public inquiry had been achieved, the 
focus was on, initially, getting it out of the 
Department of Health, got it to the Cabinet Office,
big community effort.  We were fortunate to achieve
that.  Then it was shaping it, statutory, judge-led , 
powers to compel, et cetera. 
Once the Inquiry was up and running, obviously 
now it's difficult because now most of the time,  
32 certainly my time, is spent researching to field 
questions to yourself for hearings and whatnot.  
But above that, I suppose now the wider campaign 
objective is the compensation element.  Because,
again, another reason for not making the schemes 
a focus, either way, I think it's important to say 
that I'm well aware now, as I was well aware when 
I was deciding what the campaign focus should be, 
that, from a selfish point of view, I could have sa id,
"Let's just focus on the Fatherless Generation" -- 
I know we'll come on to that -- "and let's try and get 
those who have lost parents included in the support
scheme".  Which of course still needs to happen.  B ut 
I could have just pursued that.  And to be honest,
with everything that has gone on over the last 
six years, I think that would have been much easier
achieved than what has been.  And from a selfish po int 
of view, I could have said, "Well, that's me sorted ."
But I felt that -- it was even less so to do 
with the wider community, if I'm honest.  I felt th at 
if that happened, I still wake up tomorrow feeling 
like this isn't finished.  And so I want to be able  to 
wake up and feel that this is finished.  Not the pa in 
and the suffering, but the campaign is finished.  A nd 
for me, changing a support scheme or whatever wasn' t                                   
 
                             3 going to do that for me.
So I don't know if I've answered the question 
there.

 A combination of meetings, but I think the one that
really sticks out in my mind, and it's worth saying
that I used to attend those meetings generally with
the purpose of just listening.  And it also has to be 
said that I think it is good that it's a Parliament ary 
group where those of us impacted can attend it.  Yo u 
know, I think that was really good, to have that ki nd 
of access. 
However, the one meeting that really sticks in 
my mind, at a guess it was 2016 or 2017, Jackie 
Doyle-Price had come to that APPG meeting to addres s 
concerns around the schemes.  And again, because th at 
wasn't a focus for me, I -- my intention was to jus t 
listen to this.  And the way she behaved in that                                   
 
                             1 meeting just -- I couldn't believe it, in a sense. 
I'm sure people that had been doing this for longer
than me took it as par for the course, but me being
fresher to it, I could not believe the way that sic k 
and dying people were fobbed off by this woman. 
People were pouring their hearts out, talking 
about how bad their lives were, how bad their healt h 
is and you could tell that -- and maybe that's part  of 
being a minister, is that you deal with so many cau ses 
that you become indifferent to it, I don't know.  B ut 
it was hard for me to watch it.  And I could see th e 
stress in people's faces, you know, I could see the  -- 
how infuriated they were.  And, in particular, one 
widow who does have anonymity, so I won't say her 
name, was sat in the front row really trying to tak e 
this Minister to task, utilising every kind of, in her 
mind, legal point that she thought that she could, but 
getting absolutely nowhere. 
And it just stuck with me, actually, as (1) 
a reminder of how badly people are dealt with by 
ministers, but also (2) of why I was not going to 
pursue a campaign which basically comprised of 
restating the position over and over again to peopl e 
that frankly don't care and aren't going to do 
something unless they're forced to, either legally or  
42 by the sheer weight of public opinion. 
And I think that's demonstrated by, you know, 
the 30 April 2019 uplift, that just so happened to be 
when the Inquiry started, by the recent written 
ministerial statement that just so happened to come  at 
the time that it did.  And, of course, the 
announcement of the compensation framework study th at 
just so happened to be announced the day before Mat t 
Hancock gives evidence. 
It's obvious.  And it was also -- this same 
thing was stated by Lord David Owen at the Bad Bloo d 
documentary screening, where they said they will do  as 
little as they can get away with in public opinion at 
the time.  And I didn't want any part of playing in to 
that, that game.  But I think that pretty much sums  up 
the indifference side of it. 

--Result #45--
 So you can see, in the bottom left of these dockets 
119 that date, 9 February '93, and that date is 
referenced, as well, in the Department of Health 
internal audit produced in, I think, 2000 in relati on 
to these files. 
So on this day, the files are closed, retained 
in section, and marked for a review in five years' 
time, which -- again, is open to further 
investigation, I think -- occurs on exactly the sam e 
day that for the first time the issue of hepatitis C 
compensation is raised in the House of Commons by A lf 
Morris.  I think that's on page 48 of the CBCA 
document, the Hansard reference. 

--Result #46--
 That, I think, takes me very neatly to my penultima te 
topic for you, which is about financial support and 
171 compensation, and then there are two strands to tha t 
that I want to ask you about. 
First of all, in your statement, you say that 
you or Factor 8 had campaigned for compensation to be 
paid on a proper legal basis similar to the Republi c 
of Ireland.  I think you've given that as an exampl e 
rather than as a model that must be followed.
Again, just in broad terms, what did you see as 
the advantages of such a scheme, and what response,  if 
any, had that campaign resulted in? 

--Result #47--
 Well, it was myself that, in the January 2020 meeti ng 
with Oliver Dowden and Nadine Dorries, put forward 
this notion that they should be engaging with us on
a compensation framework now.  And I was supported in 
that by a number of individuals that were there, an d 
what followed. 
We were pushing that because of the fact that -- 
well, on one hand, because we now have the public 
Inquiry, and the nature of our goals was: public 
inquiry, compensation, accountability.  We have the
public inquiry, which to some extent will help with
the third point, of accountability, and so it was s een 
that, in the meantime, let's go after the compensat ion 
point.  Push that. 
The current exercise announced around that, it  
172 did catch us offguard.  We -- I don't think we were
expecting such an exercise to be announced.  I thin k 
we saw it working differently, but needless to say,  we 
welcome it. 
As regards to the Republic of Ireland, 
ultimately, you know, what we're campaigning for, w e 
believe people are entitled to common law damages - - 
I mean, what's important about the Republic of Irel and 
scheme, and again, I know that Tony Farrugia had 
touched on this in his closing remarks when he gave
evidence, is that in terms of those who have died, the 
claim is treated as if they are not, for the purpos es
of the full assessment of their damages.
Now any in-depth questions around damages 
I would refer to our lawyers, because I don't think  my 
knowledge is great enough to talk about that, but 
that's one of the main points from the Republic of 
Ireland that we think is very important. 

--Result #48--
 That was ultimately what this resulted in being 
changed, but just to outline a number of the things 
175 that I would take issue with, so the beginning of, 
I guess, the second paragraph, "One tragic aspect",  it 
says: 
"One tragic aspect of the epidemic was because,
initially, no one understood that the disease was 
transmitted by body fluids." 
I take issue with that sentence.  I take issue 
with the sentence that follows that. 
"Every haemophiliac in the country received 
frequent blood transfusions from the National Healt h 
Service." 
I mean, I could unpick that but I think it's 
obvious.  Not every haemophiliac received frequent 
treatment.  And beyond that, they weren't receiving
blood transfusions. 
Going down a couple of lines, starting -- the 
sentence starting "Very quickly" -- well, those two
words:
"Very quickly, before our scientists and doctors 
appreciated that blood supplies needed to be treate d 
to be safe, more than 1,200 haemophiliacs in Britai n 
contracted HIV." 
I would suggest that it's not the case that all 
1,200 people infected with HIV were infected before
scientists or doctors appreciated that there was  
176 a problem.  And in fact, that sentence is in comple te 
contrast to the legal advice that was given to the 
Department of Health, which I can't go to the 
document, but it was highlighted in the In Cold Blo od 
documentary broadcast on ITV in September last year .
And then we come on to this other disputed line.  H e 
says: 
"The haemophiliacs who spent the rest of their 
lives with this disease were eventually given 
compensation ..." 
Clearly they weren't, because we're still 
campaigning for that now.  And also, going down the
page a few more lines, the sentence beginning "When
I became the only health minister": 
"When I became the only health minister from 
that time still prominent in the public eye, these 
campaigners usually named me in their campaigns,
because it improved their prospects of publicity." 
I have no concern about our prospects of 
publicity when it comes to Ken Clarke.  I think thi s 
demonstrates ego, perhaps, to take that view.  And 
then also, going down another three or so lines, he
talks about Simon Glenarthur, who he says was the 
minister responsible for this area.  The sentence: 
"Simon behaved impeccably throughout the crisis                                   
 
                             77 but unfortunately he [had] acted on the medical and
scientific advice given to him ..." 
I have little doubt the Inquiry has access to 
the various letters sent by Dr Peter Foster when he
was at the ASTMS to Lord Glenarthur, telling him th at 
factor concentrates should be withdrawn, and we sho uld 
stop importing product from America due to the risk  of 
AIDS, and the various rebuttals he received.  So to
say the medical and scientific advice somehow was t hat 
that shouldn't happen is wrong, because the 
documentary evidence doesn't support it. 
So there's a lot about this page I don't like.

--Result #49--
 Last question on compensation. 
We can take that down, thank you, Soumik. 
Compensation is, it would appear, now actively 
under consideration through the appointment of the 
independent reviewer, you mentioned a few moments a go 
something that, as it were, came out of the blue 
a little.  Could we just look at one document.  It' s 
a Parliamentary question and answer from yesterday or 
the day before, RLIT0000661.  If we look at the bot tom 
half of the page, sorry the date is 7 June, three o r 
four days ago, but this week.
Penny Mordaunt -- sorry, can we just go back. 
Can we just see the question?  Just go back up,
Soumik. 
The question posed by Kevan Jones: 
"To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster 
and Minister for the Cabinet Office, whether people
affected by contaminated blood products will have 
access to legal representation for the infected blo od 
compensation framework review." 
Then we can see the answer by the Chancellor of 
the Duchy of Lancaster, Penny Mordaunt:  
179 "The compensation framework study will provide 
advice on potential compensation framework design a nd 
solutions to Government.  It is important that 
Sir Robert Francis QC, the independent reviewer, is
able to complete his work as quickly as thoroughnes s 
allows." 
You might have copyright on that phrase sir, I'm 
not sure:
"At the outset of the Infected blood Inquiry, 
the then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster decid ed 
that it was overwhelmingly in the public interest t hat 
legal representation for infected and affected core
participants in the inquiry should be funded by 
Government, and without means testing.  This fundin g 
will continue until the conclusion of the Inquiry. 
However, this study [so there's Sir Robert Francis 
independent compensation framework review] is quite
separate from the Inquiry.  Sir Robert will want to
hear directly from infected and affected people and
put them at the heart of the process.  Legal 
representation will not be required to put forward 
views." 
So it would appear from this, and the reason I'm 
raising it with you, Jason, is not just because the
timing, in terms of this is an announcement made th is  
180 week, but you've made some observations in your 
statement about funding for legal representation fo r 
the early stages of the Inquiry process.  There may be 
an echo of that here.  You'd identified the problem s 
that might arise through not having legal 
representation in the early stages of the Inquiry 
process. 
Do you have any observations or thoughts or 
concerns about this announcement, this recent 
announcement, that there will be no funding for leg al 
representation for the infected and affected in ter ms 
of participation in and Sir Robert Francis' review?

--Result #50--
 Well, according to Penny Mordaunt, we've now all 
developed the ability to be PI lawyers and can make
schedules of loss and heads of loss.  Clearly, we'r e 
not and we can't do that.  People are sick and they
are dying, and to expect us to be able to do that i s 
wrong. 
And, to give context to this as well, on the day 
the written ministerial -- sorry, it wasn't a writt en 
ministerial announcement.  On the day that the 
compensation framework review chairperson, Sir Robe rt 
Francis QC, was announced, there was a Zoom meeting
organised by the APPG.  Penny Mordaunt joined that 
meeting, I attended it along with a variety of othe rs,                                  
 
                             81 including The Haemophilia Society and other 
campaigners and a number of MPs. 
Penny Mordaunt joined that meeting and began to 
explain the detail of what we now know about that 
compensation framework review.  And she said "Oh, I 'm 
saying this now because I wanted to give you guys t he 
scoop on what's going on", you know, trying to make  us 
feel important and like we were on some inside trac k. 
But, of course, in the days of the Internet, and us
not being completely stupid, despite what they may 
think, the Government had press released it on thei r 
website about a minute before she began to say, "Oh ,
we're giving you the inside scoop".  And actually,
despite the differences I may have with The 
Haemophilia Society, Clive Smith did take 
Penny Mordaunt to task about that, and I think he w as 
right to. 
On that Zoom meeting, I thankfully had the 
chance to ask Penny Mordaunt this very question. 
I asked her: will victims and families have access to 
legal representation?  And she gave this answer: "O h,
I don't think you'll need that.  It will be okay.
They want to hear from you directly".
And one of the justifications Penny gave me for 
that, she said, "We don't want this to be some long ,  
182 drawn-out, bureaucratic process".
I rebutted her on that, and I said: surely, for 
2,000 people to make their own representations to t his 
process will result in exactly that happening, as 
opposed to -- and I suggested taking those legal fi rms 
that represent Core Participants in this Inquiry 
making the representations and I didn't then have t he 
opportunity to make a further rebuttal but it didn' t 
seem like she agreed with my view on that either. 
Then obviously, naturally, I should probably 
mention the fact that we all heard, when Matt Hanco ck 
gave evidence, he said something quite different to
what is outlined here.  And he said yes, we should 
have that. 
So, like the Ken Clarke/Hugh Rossi letters, we 
have two Government ministers saying different thin gs.
One of them is wrong and, weirdly for Matt Hancock,
one of them is right.  And I hope that Penny Mordau nt 
does reverse the Government's position on this, 
because it's wrong to expect sick, dying, bereaved,
injured people to become PI lawyers and to be expec ted 
to know the ins and outs of common law damages and 
compensation. 

--Result #51--
 There are quite a lot of contributors to that view.
I think we would have been generally informed by 
Pearson that this was the line we should take, but we 
had explored, because, at this time there was -- yo u 
know, the Northern Echo weren't the first -- wasn't
the first time that compensation had been raised.  We 
had talked to medical colleagues, and there is 
a minute in the papers that you've given me from 
Dr Smithies, for example, where she is quite clear 
that the line should be held because otherwise ther e 
are lots of patients who -- she uses the word "are 
killed by their -- the treatment that they receive" , 
not -- the drugs that -- and that therefore this li ne 
is fine, that there is no reason why haemophiliacs 
should be considered in a different way. 
And I think that memo pre-dates this by six 
months or so, so it was something that was consider ed. 
We were -- in HS1A, we would have certainly 
followed the advice from Med SEB, Dr Smithies and - - 
yeah, I think that's probably about it. 

--Result #52--
 Now if we just look, as I say, at Dr Smithies' note  or 
one of her notes for a slightly different reason, 
DHSC0001383.  It's dated 17 February 1987.  It's fr om 
Dr Smithies to Mr Harris and we can see it's -- the
topic is compensation for haemophiliacs. 
I am not going to go through the detail of it 
with you but I wanted to ask, if we look at the thi rd 
page, about one observation she made.  So under the
heading "Compensation" it says -- or she says: 
"It seems likely that we have a finite number of 
haemophiliacs who have contracted HIV infection. 
Their position is pitiful and has attracted great 
sympathy in particular because of the perceived sti gma 
of the disease which is associated with promiscuous
sexual activity." 
And then this, and it's this issue about 
hepatitis I wanted to ask you about: 
"The equally sad fact that a number of 
haemophiliacs will undoubtedly die of chronic 
hepatitis as a result of non-A non-B infection has not                                   
 
                             3 been recognised publicly." 
It may be said, the Inquiry has certainly heard 
evidence to this effect, received evidence to this 
effect, that a number of haemophiliacs, or indeed 
those infected with hepatitis through transfusion, 
were not aware in the 1980s, and 1987, that this wa s 
potentially the death sentence that Dr Smithies is 
here spelling out. 
Did the Department, to your knowledge, in the 
time you were there, give consideration as to makin g 
some form of public statement or public explanation
about the position in relation to those infected wi th 
non-A, non-B hepatitis? 

--Result #53--
 Can I then come to ask you, then, about the liaison
that you had with the Haemophilia Society, and in 
particular what led to the establishment of the 
Macfarlane Trust.  
94 So I think we can pick it up at DHSC0004541_145. 
This is a minute from you, 23 September 1987, and i t 
refers in the first paragraph to the 
Haemophilia Society seeking a meeting with the 
Secretary of State about compensation for 
haemophiliacs infected with HIV. 
And then you've referred to the 
Haemophilia Society's campaign, and you say in 
paragraph 4 that: 
"... the media and many MPs will be sympathetic 
to their campaign."
Then paragraph 5: 
"Officials recommend a meeting before the next 
session so that Minister can demonstrate that he is
personally aware of their case." 
Now, a meeting did take place, Dr Moore, with 
the Haemophilia Society and, as I understand it, yo u 
have a recollection of that meeting.  We can put 
a date on it in a moment, but what's your recollect ion 
of the meeting between the Secretary of State and t he 
Haemophilia Society?

--Result #54--
 Well, it was a very incredible meeting.  I have bee n 
to thousands of meetings but that one is very clear  in 
my mind.  John Moore, the Secretary of State -- no 
relation to myself -- agreed to meet the  
95 Haemophilia Society, and we had provided briefing f or 
the Secretary of State before the meeting, which wa s,
on the lines that we have just looked at, that we 
don't think that this group should -- or could be 
compensated, and he'd accepted that.
We went to the meeting, we had someone from 
Finance, we had a solicitor there and we had myself
and my boss from HS, and the Haemophilia Society ca me 
with the Reverend Alan Tanner, their chairman, and 
David Watters, the general secretary, who I'd worke d 
with quite closely, actually, in the lead-up to thi s 
meeting.  And they also brought three young men who
had contracted HIV from their blood products. 
And I think we knew they were coming and we'd 
expected them to be angry, we'd expected a difficul t 
meeting.  And they each presented their case and it
was extraordinarily moving.  Even at the distance o f 
time, I find it moving just to recollect it, that o ne 
of them explained that, you know, he was engaged to  be 
married and now he -- there was no point in going 
ahead with his marriage.  Another explained how he had 
got a young wife, he was desperately worried about 
what would happen to them when he died.  And what 
struck us, actually, was that these were people who
had a right to be angry and they weren't; they were 
96 only concerned about the families that they would 
leave behind. 
And we listened and we were really moved. 
I mean, I don't think I've ever seen a minister wee p 
before but John Moore -- and we were totally, total ly 
dumbfounded, really.  And, anyway, the 
Haemophilia Society delegation left, and we sat rou nd 
and it wasn't a question of whether we do anything,  it 
was, you know, what can we do?  What actually can w e 
do?  And I've never really seen any meeting that's 
kind of changed direction so quickly or to such gre at 
effect as that. 
And so we -- I mean, John Moore was adamant that 
we had to do something, and we were -- had to work out 
quite what we could do, and that's when -- I mean, it 
took off -- it took off then.  We were -- we 
couldn't -- even then, we couldn't involve the 
Department in the sort of "no fault" compensation 
scheme.  We had to say if we are going to compensat e 
this group, or give this group money, then how do w e 
ring-fence it? 
We ring-fence the group and we ring-fence the 
money, so we didn't call it compensation; we called  it 
a welfare payment recognising the special needs tha t 
this group had, and then we endeavoured to explain why                                   
 
                             7 haemophiliacs in this position were somehow differe nt 
to the people that Dr Smithies referred to who had 
other illnesses and other treatments. 
We came up with a ring-fence, I think it was on 
the basis that this was different because people ha d 
a hereditary disease, therefore there was a likelih ood 
that there would be more than one person in the fam ily 
who might be affected, that they had been -- they h ad 
been affected since birth with haemophilia, so they
hadn't had the same opportunities to build up in th eir 
careers a substantial financial buffer and, using 
this -- and that they were, in fact, a finite group .  
So with this ring-fence and the suggestion that 
this was a welfare payment rather than compensation , 
John Moore took it to -- well, he -- I think we've got 
documents showing that we provided a briefing for 
John Moore to take to cabinet because he had to tak e 
it through the cabinet committee. 
We in Health, we hadn't got the money, 
£10 million, we hadn't got the money within the hea lth 
budget, so we had to go and squeeze it out of Treas ury 
and, as I recall, Treasury were really -- they thou ght 
a ring-fence was really flaky and they were concern ed 
that it might be breached.  But nevertheless, at th at 
stage, John Moore was actually quite a powerful  
98 figure.  He was only appointed by Margaret Thatcher , I
think, in July '88 so this was one of his first big
things, he was powerful.  So we got the money out o f 
Treasury, we got £10 million out of Treasury and th en 
it was announced in the Commons that we were going to 
go ahead with it. 

--Result #55--
 No, no, that's just for the benefit of the transcri pt. 
I'm just going to give two documentary 
references, I don't think we need to go to the 
documents because you've summarised what I would ha ve 
asked you about them, in any event, but there's 
a question and answer brief that you prepared on 
13 November 1987 and the reference, for the benefit  of 
the transcript, is DHSC0002375_072.  That tells us,
I think, that the meeting that you're describing to ok 
place on 3 November 1987. 
Then, in terms of a degree of -- well, what 
might be said to be a degree of reluctance on the p art 
of the Treasury, there's a minute from Mr Harris, 
4 November 1987, which talks about meetings with th e 
Treasury copied to you and, again, I'll just read o ut 
the reference, DHSC0002375_047. 
As you've said, Dr Moore, it was very -- it was  
99 made I think very clear in the -- by the Department
that this was not compensation and this was a singl e 
one-off payment of £10 million.  The mechanism that
was then used to distribute it was through the 
establishment of the Macfarlane Trust. 
I've got a handful of questions, further 
questions on this topic, sir, but I note the time, so 
it might be sensible just to take the lunch break n ow 
and then I can finish this topic fairly quickly aft er 
lunch.

--Result #56--
 Then I think, looking at the documents, MPs, 
individual MPs, continued to push the Secretary of 
State, who was still John Moore at that stage, on t his 
issue, and there are references in the materials wh ich 
I know you've seen to Clare Short MP and then to 
Robin Cook MP, raising the case of individual 
constituents. 
So if we look at DHSC0003960_019.
I'm not going to go through the detail of it but 
this is from you, 11 May 1988, attaching a "backgro und 
brief for [the] Secretary of State's meeting on 16 May 
with Robin Cook, regarding compensation for recipie nts 
of blood infected with HIV". 
If we just go to page 5, "Line to Take", 
107 paragraphs 16 and 17, is it right to understand,
Dr Moore, that at this point in time again the same
line was maintained: not to make payments to those who 
were infected through blood transfusion? 

--Result #57--
 Now if we then go to DHSC0003960_015, we have a min ute 
from Mr Harris dated 27 June 1988, the first paragr aph 
of which says: 
"I understand the Secretary of State has asked 
how financial help could be provided to recipients of 
HIV infected blood and organs in a similar way to t he 
haemophilia scheme." 
Then Mr Harris sets out a number of matters. 
Is this right, then: that although officials had 
advised maintaining no compensation or -- sorry, no
financial support, no ex gratia payments for this 
category of individuals, the Secretary of State was n't 
entirely onside with that, wasn't entirely convince d, 
and wanted there to be further consideration given to 
this issue? 

--Result #58--
 Then the last matter just goes back to a question 
I asked you this morning.  When we were talking abo ut 
the Department's general line to take on compensati on, 
and its application to the cohort of people with 
haemophilia infected with HIV, that the phrase that 's 
in -- the general line is: "We don't compensate for
unavoidable adverse effects which may arise from so me 
medical procedures." 
And you may recall, Dr Moore, I asked you 
whether, during your time in the Department of Heal th, 
so again, I'm really only talking about the period  
191 '86 to '88, unless you've got knowledge of anything
before that, I asked you whether there was any 
investigation, inquiry or analysis internally withi n 
the Department as to whether there'd been culpabili ty 
or fault on anyone's part, and I'm not sure that yo u 
answered that directly.  I don't mean that 
pejoratively but I've been asked to put it to you 
again or ask you again. 
In deciding whether -- or in deciding that the 
general compensation line to take would be applied to 
the haemophilia cohort, did the Department of Healt h, 
to your knowledge, actually investigate whether the re 
had been culpability or fault? 

--Result #59--
 If we turn to the next page, we have a note written  by 
you and it's quite long but I'm going to read it ou t 
for the benefit of those who are watching, and then
I'll ask you a question about it, Dr Gillon.  You s ay 
this: 
"The question we have been asked -- whether HCV 
lookback was worthwhile -- is not for us to answer. 
127 Ask the patients -- as I have done -- and you get 
an unequivocal 'YES!'.  They certainly feel that th ey 
have the right to the information, primarily so tha t 
they can seek treatment, but also, in some cases, t o 
allow them to seek compensation (and possibly reven ge)
through the courts and from government.  What right
have we to withhold it? 
"That said, the more interesting question that 
arises is 'Why did it take so long?'  Was it becaus e 
there was no treatment available?  No.  Interferon was 
shown to be beneficial in trials of treatment of 
non-A, non-B hepatitis before HCV was identified, a nd 
the antibody test very quickly established that 
non-A, non-B equalled C.  Though unlicensed, 
interferon treatment was therefore available. 
Furthermore, the fact that HIV lookback was institu ted 
from the beginning of routine testing, when no 
treatment of any kind was available, suggests that in 
the case of HCV, the treatment issue was a red 
herring. 
"Was it, then, the uncertainty about sexual and 
vertical transmission that held us back?  Although 
less efficiently transmitted by these routes than 
hepatitis B or HIV, it was quite rapidly confirmed 
that heterosexual transmission is not uncommon, and 
128 indeed most transfusion services quickly decided th at 
sexual partners of HCV infected individuals should not 
be allowed to donate.  Vertical transmission was al so 
shown to occur -- an important consideration in you ng 
female transfusion recipients, especially those 
transfused perinatally. 
"Then it must have been about money, surely? 
There is no doubt that lookbacks are time-consuming
and difficult.  In reality, however, very little in
the way of new resources has been committed to 
lookback programmes." 
You then discuss that point, and you carry on at 
the bottom of this column: 
"What, then, was really going on?  Why did the 
transfusion community in different countries decide
not to carry out lookback as soon as antibody testi ng 
was introduced, only then to perform a volte-face s o 
late in the day, when logistical difficulty had bee n 
heaped on logistical difficulty?  And what can we 
learn from it all?
"I think the problem is one of psychology rather 
than logic.  Lookbacks are difficult to manage and 
very unsatisfactory in terms of outcome.  The proce ss 
takes forever, much of it has to be delegated to bu sy 
individuals outside the service, whose good opinion s                                   
 
                             29 we cherish.  It is incredibly difficult to keep tab s 
on all the data.  The whole thing seems very 
retrogressive when everything else in transfusion 
medicine is tending towards cleaner process control
and increasingly hands-off management.  We 
instinctively shy away from our messy pasts, just l ike 
some of our donors who say 'It was all so long ago' . 
And, most significantly, no-one relishes the task o f 
telling patients that they were harmed by the 
interventions that were meant to help them. 
"In reality, at least in the UK, the profession 
did not make the about-turn voluntarily.  We were 
forced into it, by a combination of peer pressure i n 
the form of published articles showing that the 
process was feasible, patient pressure and, crucial ly, 
burgeoning media interest.  It was largely fortuito us,
but extremely convenient, that the decision by the 
Government to recommend lookback in 1995 coincided 
with the licensing of [alpha interferon] for this 
indication. 
"The most important thing we can learn from this 
is that such procrastination should not happen agai n. 
When we administer the transplant that a blood 
transfusion really is, we must accept the continuin g 
responsibility for the medical consequences of that 
130 intervention, without limit of time.  Anything else
that comes out of the exercise in a global sense --
knowledge of natural history, epidemiology, treatme nt 
or whatever -- may be extremely valuable (and will 
have an impact on the cost-effectiveness equation),
but this will take time to emerge.  These aspects, 
however, must not be allowed to cloud the essential
ethical issue, which is about the responsibility of
an individual doctor to an individual patient." 
Dr Gillon, that's what you wrote in 1999.  Are 
they still your views today?

--Result #60--
 I don't know what that really meant, it was her wor ds  
48 not mine, but I think that one always had to rememb er 
that we were not supposed to be telling the Trust w hat 
to do.  But I would have expected my opinions, 
particularly since they were shared by Kenneth Clar ke, 
to be passed over.  But it was not my job to tell t he 
Trust what to do but what we tried to do was to 
reassure them that there would be more money for 
appropriate reasons.
Now, what was an inappropriate reason would be for 
people who thought that this was about compensation . 
It could be about compensation but that is a differ ent 
area altogether.  What this was about was trying to
ensure that the necessary expenses that came about 
because a member of the family had AIDS was somethi ng 
that they could be paid a supplementary income to h elp 
them deal with it.  Although, even for 30 years ago ,
the sums involved were quite small.

 "In this, they indicate that they are venturing int o 
the expensive business of helping with housing need s. 
Thereafter they envisage that the £10m may not be 
adequate to meet all that the Trust Deed expects of
them. 
"They clearly wish to raise this issue and to 
seek reassurances that 'the policies, schemes and 
practices adopted by the Trustees subscribe to the

setting up the Fund. 
"The ongoing litigation in the High Court re 
compensation for HIV infected haemophiliacs, and th e 
allied claim by The Haemophilia Society for 
a £200 million out-of-Court settlement is expected to 
revive media interest in the Macfarlane Trust's 
activities. 
"A meeting has therefore been arranged for 
7 September." 
If we then move on to a report of that meeting,
and this is at DHSC0003511_067. 
I should say this is a document that is not 
referred to in your witness statement.  That is 
because the document was only found and provided to
you by the Inquiry after you had completed your 
statement. 
This is from Strachan Heppell to Mr Davey, again, 
14 September 1989:
"Minister will wish to know the outcome of my 
recent meeting with the Chairman and representative s 
of the Macfarlane Trust." 
"2.  The Trust gave an account of their spending 
which totaled £1 million in 1988/89 and is expected  to 
be just over £1¾ million in the current financial  
62 year.  I gave them the reassurance they were seekin g 
that Ministers supported the Trust in its work and 
were generally content with the progress that had b een 
made so far. 
"3.  As expected, though, the main question they 
wished to discuss was whether there would be any mo re 
Government money for the Trust.  Payments are alrea dy 
eating into the capital and the Trustees estimate t hat 
the original £10 million grant will run out in 7 or
8 years time.  They foresee a continuing need, 
particularly in supporting dependents and helping w ith 
housing costs and are concerned that they should be
able to make commitments with a clearer view of the
future of the Trust.
"4.  The advice I gave them was that the right 
time to approach Ministers about additional funding
would be when the Trust funds were sufficient to me et 
commitments for only another 2 or 3 years. 
An approach now would be too early for the issue to  be 
properly addressed.  I went on to emphasise, though , 
that we would not wish the Trustees to make more 
frugal offers of help than they would otherwise 
consider reasonable simply to conserve funds." 
"5.  The Trustees are anxious to have a more 
formal response which they could use publicly.  Som e  
63 haemophiliacs who do not need help at present, ask if 
the Trust will still be around in a few years time.
"6.  I could see the force of this argument. 
I therefore said that I would consider whether 
officials could helpfully exchange letters with the
Trust which responded to Trustees' concern.  Having
reflected on this, I think this is the right course
and I propose if Minister is content to write on th e 
lines of the attached draft.  The contents would be
shown to the Trust before the formal exchange so th ey 
would know what to expect.  They would show us a co py 
of their reply in the same way. 
"7.  The draft letter reflects what Mr Newton 
said when making the announcement about the Trust t o 
the House -- a copy is attached." 
I won't take you to that draft.  It is to be found 
at the same reference number and it reflects what 
Mr Heppell said in that minute. 
Then if we could have DHSC0003511_066.
This is your response to Mr Heppell's minute.  It 
is dated 22 September 1989.  It is sent by your 
private secretary, who said: 
"MS(H) has seen your submission of 14 September

 Yes.  The reason is really because at page 3 we hav e 
a very helpful summary of the position of the Trust  as 
it stood on literally the day before you left the 
Department of Health.  We can see that it takes the
story a little bit further forward from those 
documents that we have just looked at.
What the briefing says is this and I quote: 
"5.  From the outset Ministers have made it                                   
 
                             5 clear that the £10 million given to the 
Macfarlane Trust was not intended as a compensation
payment to HIV infected haemophiliacs generally, bu t 
was to help in cases of genuine financial need.  Th e 
Trust's allocation policy is set out in Annex 
--Result #63--
 Who has to decide, yes. 
I mean, in the end, not wanting to spoil the end 
of the story, but we did get there.  But, I mean, y ou 
know, proper payments were made.  Although I'm sure
there were people who thought they weren't adequate , 
were a jolly sight more adequate than it started of f 
as.  But it -- no, it's frustrating.  See, what 
I wanted to do was just to deal straightaway with t his 
problem and just offer proper compensation and, you
know, hope that the misery that we had inflicted,
without intending to, on these folk at least could be 
alleviated to some degree. 
Of course happily, because of the way things have 
panned out, a lot of people have lived a lot longer
than was then anticipated.  At that time we thought
that AIDS was a death sentence.  And fortunately we
were wrong about that but it is still not very 
pleasant to have it.  I have a very dear friend who
got AIDS 40-odd years ago -- and in fact he won't m ind 
me mentioning it, dear [redacted] *.  He was a cabi net 
minister for Labour.  He remains a very close frien d. 
And, you know, he is still here, very happy, but th e 
ravages of the treatment, you know, it's awful.  Bu t

 -- "as to how other countries with this problem hav e 
dealt with the matter." 
For the West German scheme I don't think I need to 
take you back to the document but it was a payment 
scheme that was based on the idea of a no-fault 
compensation -- 

--Result #65--
 Yes.  I mean, if you are going to offer people 
compensation it should be proper compensation.  And
no -- we've never adopted no-fault liability becaus e 
no-fault liability in a way is the easy way out for
those who should have to judge themselves as to wha t 
they did.  Because no-fault liability means you get

liability", what do you end up with?  You don't end
up with enough for the people who really ought to g et

"One by one [this person] has watched fellow 
haemophiliacs with AIDS die, leaving their families  in

it could take another 18 months for the issue to wo rk

"A campaign is now intensifying to save [this

If we could go to the next column please, picking 
it up from the words "Frank Field": 
"Frank Field, the chairman of the social services 
select committee and vice-president of the Haemophi lia 
Society, will be among those heading the campaign i n 
Parliament: 'We already know that over 100 people h ave 
died: this issue isn't going to go away.  The 
government has to duty to act quickly', he said. 
"'What most of these people want is simply to know 
that their families will be financially secure when
they are gone.  Surely that is not too much?'"                                  
 
                             9 If we could then, please, go to column 3.  Forgive 
me, it is down towards the bottom, the paragraph 
starting "Owen said".  This is a reference to 
Dr David Owen, your predecessor -- sorry, not 
predecessor but one of the previous occupants of th e 
post of Minister of State for Health.  Dr Owen is 
quoted as saying: 
"It is a great scandal, I was absolutely 
appalled when I discovered so little had been done.
I believe there was serious maladministration on th e 
part of the Department of Health." 
That is a reference particularly to a failure to 
achieve self-sufficiency in blood products.  Then i f 
we could go to the next column, please, and the fin al 
paragraph -- sorry final two paragraphs beginning w ith 
a redaction. 
Sorry, if we could just come out again, please,
for a second.  I'm sorry, it is the fourth column. 
The last of the long columns, the final paragraph 
there.  Thank you. 
This is -- again, another name redacted of 
a person with haemophilia who had been infected.  I t 
says: 
"[This person], a victim whose plight was first 
highlighted in The Sunday Times last year, is still 
90 waiting for action -- more than two years after 
starting legal proceedings.  As yet, he has not 
developed AIDS, but last week he went into hospital
for cancer treatment, and he knows that he may neve r 
come out. 
"His view of the government's position is 
uncompromising: 'Their attitude seems to be that if
they leave it long enough, we will all die off and 
there won't be so much compensation to pay.  So far
they have completely failed to show even a moral 
acceptance of their mistake.  I can see them 
contesting it all the way.'"
Then, in the next column, there is a comparison of 
some of the international -- other countries and th eir 
approach, and if I read from that: 
"In west Germany where drug companies pay 
a proportion of their profits into a fund to cover 
such cases, victims have been paid between £15,000 and 
£160,000.  In Scandinavia, governments have made 
awards of about £18,000, while in France, state 
payments are up to £17,000 for a victim and £22,500
for the family of a haemophiliac who has died of 
AIDS." 
A couple of points arising from that statement. 
The political pressure.  How significant was that  
91 pressure on the Department of Health and on you at 
that time, October 1989, in thinking about how you 
were going to approach -- 

--Result #67--
 Well, the point is -- I mean, I certainly wouldn't be 
against that and I'm sorry people have had to wait 
30 years for this to happen.  That's not my view of
good government.  But the point is, just because 
something awful happens, doesn't mean it is somebod y's 
fault.  Personally, I would like to look very 
carefully at why these blood products were bought,
bearing in mind it is hard to imagine a more danger ous 
element of society to buy blood products from than the 
sort of people who would be selling those blood 
products in America. 
But, you know, no one could say on existing 
knowledge, as I understand it -- it is way off my 
time -- that this was the wrong thing to do.  But y ou 
know, our knowledge of medical science develops day  by 
day, and just because someone or a group of people or                                   
 
                             7 a government didn't have that insight at that time,
doesn't mean that they are wrong and doesn't mean, in 
my opinion, that they must automatically pay the ut ter 
most amount of compensation because I really do thi nk 
that no fault compensation is -- sounds wonderful. 
Was it Professor Maitland of Cambridge 
University -- I don't know if you studied him when you 
were training to be a lawyer -- said "To every huma n 
problem there is an answer, simple, obvious and 
wrong".

 And to do something about it, yes.  I mean, you kno w, 
no fault -- I understand all the general objections  to 
no fault compensation.  But I thought that the 
ingenuity, the collective ingenuity of those named in 
that, would be able to find a point of distinction 
that would allow proper compensation to be offered

into all manner of other traps, in relation to caus es 
that, while they believe themselves to be worthy on es, 
I'm not going to die in the last ditch for diazepam
folk, wrongly, I am sure, but my view was that that
was a different level of problem to what happened w ith 
HIV positive people.

 Explicitly increase funding to the 
Macfarlane Trust. 
"13.  The Macfarlane Trust could be given 
additional funds, again on an ex-gratia basis. 
Realistically the Trust Deed would need to be amend ed 
to place minimal emphasis on 'means testing' and 
perhaps to allow substantial help with loans for 
housing etc.  The additional amount would be a matt er 
of judgment.  At one extreme an additional £5-10m
would at least indicate that the Government were 
sympathetic to the plight of haemophiliacs.  But it
would still leave compensation in the UK behind som e 
other European countries (See Annex B).  It would b e 
unlikely to buy off the litigation (and might even be 
counter productive if it were regarded as too mean) . 
At the other extreme, an injection sufficient to 
satisfy the Plaintiff's financial aspirations would
involve a substantial amount moving towards the lik ely 
range of costs for an out-of-Court settlement.  It is 
difficult to assess whether increasing the Trust Fu nd 
financially will meet the Plaintiffs' other 
motivation(s) for the Court action, viz to establis h  
114 official recognition that they have become infected
with HIV as a result of contaminated blood products . 
Some might proceed with litigation in any event. 
Moreover, there are signs that the haemophiliacs ar e 
looking for a lump sum without having to submit to any 
'needs' test however generously it is effected. 
Channelling more money through the Macfarlane Trust
might not therefore dissuade many Plaintiffs from t he 
Court action, even though it might reduce the (now 
very extensive) public sympathy for their cause.  I t 
is also possible that if haemophiliacs had received
reasonable compensation the Legal Aid Fund would be
unlikely to continue support, and thus effectively 
reduce the likelihood of litigation continuing."

 Publicise the Government's position: 
"16.  As a matter of general policy the 
Department has so far maintained a low profile in t he 
face of critical Press and public 'rehearsals' of t he 
HIV litigation.  This could be taken to imply inert ia 
or lack of concern.  As a final option, on its own or 
in combination with one or other of Options A&D, th e 
Government could take steps (within the constraints
imposed now that the matter is before the Court) to

mentioned in the Sunday Times campaign. 
"Financing 
18.  It is highly unlikely that Treasury would 
agree to providing any substantial additional fundi ng,
particularly as the advice from Counsel is that we 
would win the case in Court.  The Department's own 
resources are very tight: there is virtually no 
flexibility this year and already strong pressure o n 
next year's resources.  These mean that an out of 
Court settlement is not likely to be a runner, and 
that it will be hard to fund any lesser concession:
"Summary 
"19.  In the light of difficulties with Options 
A, C and D, our advice remains that the Department 
should publicise the extra flexibility we have offe red 
to the Macfarlane Trust but continue to strongly 
defend the Court action.  Attempts could also be ma de 
on the publicity front to counter the critical 
reporting so far.
"Ministers may wish to consider: 
"i. whether they would wish any of the 
alternative options to be worked up in more detail; 
118 "ii. whether they would wish us to begin 
soundings with Treasury on the possibility of 
increasing, by whatever means, the funding availabl e 
to HIV infected haemophiliacs." 
So that is the document that was produced. 
I'm very briefly -- I'm conscious of the time, 
sir, I've got about --

 Yes, but there's nothing wrong with picking and 
mixing.  What one wanted to do was to get a serious
amount of compensation available and beat off all t he 
arguments either for doing nothing, or the argument s  
122 for good publicity which was just a joke, or the 
arguments that meant, well, because lots of other 
people will come in and try and take the benefit of
it, then we don't do anything and we stick where we
are.  So, yeah, I would regard that as a success 
really.

 "The Government would have therefore to reckon with
the probability of a continuing bad press over an 
extended period onwards while the trial continued, and 
perhaps beyond. 
"v.  Sustainability.  If Ministers see a strong 
probability that they would have in practice to fal l 
back on an out-of-court deal at a later stage in th e 
proceedings, it would arguably be better to conclud e                                   
 
                             45 such a deal at the outset. 
"Case for allowing litigation to continue. 
"24.  We would see the advantages in letting the 
cases continue and the risks in an out-of-court 
settlement as follows: 
"i.  Legal position.  Despite their concerns, 
the legal advisers do still appear to see the 
Government's legal position as being very strong fo r 
most of the cases.  
"Precedents/knock-on effects.  An out-of-court 
settlement risks setting damaging precedents in the
sense of nudging the system towards non-fault 
compensation and encouraging other groups of 
unfortunate sufferers to sue the Government in the 
hope of obtaining generous out-of-court deals.  Peo ple 
who have become infected through blood transfusions
are an obvious case.
"iii.  Dangerous of public auction.  We see 
a considerable danger that the Government's 
willingness to settle out-of-court, and the £42mill ion 
proposed settlement figure, would leak.  There coul d 
then be a public bargaining negotiation in which £4 2 
million would be seen as no more than the Governmen t's 
opening offer and public sympathy would be with the
haemophiliacs.  
146 "iv.  Residual litigation.  We are also 
concerned about the danger that a minority of 
haemophiliacs might decline to accept the proposed 
out-of-court settlement and pursue their cases in t he 
courts instead, in the hope of ending up with bette r 
deals.  If that happened, the Government would pick  up 
the legal costs through legal aid as well as incurr ing 
heavy expenses itself.  If the cases were successfu l, 
moreover, the Government would come under strong 
pressure to increase the earlier out-of-court 
settlement. 
"Public expenditure consequentials
"25.  If Ministers do decide to go for 
an out-of-court settlement, we would have I think t o 
accept that most, if not all, of the £50 million or
thereabouts of funding required would have to come 
from the Reserve, probably this year.  This is 
regrettable but unavoidable.  We would think it 
reasonable, however, to ask DH to absorb the costs of 
any settlement in the 20-30 medical negligence case s, 
provisionally put at some £3-5 million.  RHAs took 
over responsibility for medical negligence costs fr om 
1 April 1990. 
"Conditions for out-of-court settlement 
"26.  As implied above, the strength of the case  
147 for pursuing an out-of-court settlement depends on how 
effectively DH could deal with the risks involved, not 
least those listed above.  We would think it import ant 
for Treasury Ministers, if they are prepared to 
contemplate such a course, to insist on the followi ng 
points. 
"i.  No Government commitment at the outset to 
the £42 million figure or any other figure (lest it  be 
seen as an opening offer). 
"ii.  A clear understanding between the Treasury 
and DH that £42 million (plus the negligence cases)  is 
as far as we are prepared to go.
"iii.  DH to complete as soon as possible (if 
they have not already done so) the drafting of the 
terms on which any willingness to settle would be 
made.  It will be crucially important to avoid any 
admission of liability or any suggestion of no faul t 
compensation, while emphasising the unique 
circumstances of the present cases (including doubl e 
jeopardy) and (possibly) the Government's willingne ss 
to allow for a small risk of losing a minority of t he 
cases. 
"vi.  Any Government offer would need to be 
subject to the proviso that 100 per cent of the 
haemophiliacs would accept it (to avoid the risk of 
148 subsequent court cases). 
"v.  DH to assess and minimise the risks that 
any haemophiliacs who did not accept the deal (for 
example, haemophiliacs not previously known or a 
handful of troublemakers) would have access to lega l 
aid to pursue cases against the Government 
subsequently. 
"vi.  Access to be allowed to the Reserve this 
year for most of the settlement but not for the 
£3-5 million medical negligence element. 
"Tactics on response to haemophiliacs' counsel. 
"27.  Further to i. above, the Government might 
in principle respond to the haemophiliacs' counsel' s 
offer by making a lower counter-offer, below the 
£42 million.  The problem with this is that 
significantly lower offer would reduce the sums per
head below £20,000, and DH's legal advisers have 
suggested that the courts (who would be asked to 
endorse an out-of-court settlement) would probably not 
regard this as reasonable.  A further problem is th at 
haggling over the figure would increase the risks o f a 
public auction." 
"28.  A better tactic, which you might like to 
commend to Mr Waldegrave (if you want to go down th is 
route at all), might be to avoid any commitment to                                   
 
                             49 a figure in responding to the haemophiliacs' counse l 
but simply to say something along the lines: 
"'The Government is not in the business of 
answering hypothetical questions and wishes to know
whether counsel's clients would bake his proposal.'
"On this approach, the fact that the Government 
was not explicitly rejecting the haemophiliacs' 
counsel's proposal would give a certain signal to t he 
other side.  At the same time, the Government would
not have committed itself to a figure which could b e 
regarded as an opening offer.  In any subsequent 
bargaining, the aim would be to establish counsel's
figure as a kind of arbitrator's proposal." 
"Conclusions 
"29.  If the Chancellor is content, you may like 
to listen to what Mr Waldegrave has to say and, 
subject to that, explore the pros and cons of 
a possible out-of-court settlement with Mr Waldegra ve 
along the lines sketched out above. 
"30.  If you feel as a result of your discussion 
that the balance of advantage lies with pursuing 
an out-of-court settlement, preferably along the li nes 
and subject to the conditions suggested in the 
paragraphs 26-8, you may like to suggest that if Mr
Waldegrave minutes the Prime Minister you will stan d  
150 ready to write in support." 
That is signed by AJC Edwards.
Am I correct to read that as being a document 
which of course sets out the pros and cons of the 
issue but is broadly supportive of accepting the 
settlement?

--Result #73--
 Yes.  For completeness, let's quickly look at that.
So this information being provided to you as Chief 
Secretary was showing the "Compensation payments" o r  
154 ex gratia payments in different countries.  We can see 
that compensation payments of £60,000 had been paid
in Canada.  In Germany, £27,000, the average ranged  up 
to £165,000.  France, £10,000. 
Then "Exgratia payments": Denmark, £20-25,000;
Norway, £2,000; Ireland, £9,000; Australia, £7 mill ion 
in total; the UK, £20,000 at that time, but obvious ly 
under contemplation of a further sum to end the 
litigation.
I should say this same document also refers to the 
inevitability, as it was seen there, that any furth er 
payments would have to be disregarded for social 
security purposes -- 

--Result #74--
 We can take that down, thank you.
The arguments about the dangers of no fault 
compensation coming in through the back door, as it
were, through this litigation, were raised with you  by 
officials.  You say in your statement, 5.20, page 4 2: 
"I cannot recall being particularly concerned  
155 about this ... at the time." 

--Result #75--
 Thank you.  In the letter, you say: 
"Thank you for your letter of 2 December.
I have also seen the subsequent letters from ..."
Those names have been redacted but they shouldn't 
have been.  They are Ian Lang, Peter Brooke and Dav id 
Hunt, the other Secretaries of State: 
"2.  I understand you want to provide 
compensation for this unfortunate group and 
I sympathise.  But I also have serious reservations 
188 about whether it would be possible realistically to
ring fence any compensation.  There are a raping of
other groups who have also suffered as a result of 
treatment under the NHS where there is no question of 
negligence.  By compensating those acquiring HIV fr om 
blood transfusion, we will be taking a further long
stride towards no-fault compensation in general. 
"3.  Virginia Bottomley put forward a good 
defence of our current position in the adjournment 
debate called by Gavin Strang on 20 December.  It 
would be difficult to reverse our position so soon 
after that clear statement: 
"4.  But I also have to say that all this is 
overtaken by the extent of doctors' and dentists'
overpayments in the current year.  You will appreci ate 
that the latest news about the further overpayments  to 
dentists this year has come as a very unpleasant 
shock.  Your officials have now told mine that the 
gross overpayment to dentists this year is likely t o 
be a staggering £8,000 per dentist at the very leas t. 
That come to well over £100 million which you will be 
looking to me to provide from the Reserve.  I have 
also learned from officials that there will be clai ms 
for overpayments this year from Scotland and Wales.
It brings the cumulative over payment to doctors an d                                   
 
                             89 dentists to over half a billion pounds, more than t he 
total increases many colleagues received in their 1 991 
Survey settlements. 
"5.  In these circumstances, you leave me no 
room to help you or the other health departments by
providing additional access to the Reserve for the 
blood transfusion patients.  I cannot, therefore,
agree to what you propose." 

--Result #76--
 "3.  On blood transfusion patients infected with HI V, 
the Chief Secretary said that he would be willing t o 
agree to Mr Waldegrave proceeding with compensation  if 
it was agreed that no further groups would be given
similar treatment; and if Mr Waldegrave found all t he 
necessary funds." 
So, in essence, if he can find the money from the 
Department of Health budget, you are not going to 
prevent him going ahead, as long as he can ring fen ce 
it; is that fair?

--Result #77--
 Elections are determined by far bigger things than 
this.  This is a big thing but you are not going to
change a lot of votes because of a decision made ab out  
196 whether or not you pay compensation to people who h ave 
obtained -- sadly obtained the AIDS virus from a bl ood 
transfusion as against from a blood disease.  There
are very many things that move the dial and this 
certainly wasn't one of them.

--Result #78--

Can we have a look at the way 
that 
you describe the role
of the Blood Policy Unit and the overview of the work
that you were involved in
, 
in your second witness
statement, WITN4505002
.  
If we could go to page 5
,
please
,
 of that document
.  
We
 can see paragraph 1.7, 
you
say this:
"
I made a lateral move to Head of Blood Policy.
This involved a wide range of 
responsibilities
, 
which
increased during my time in 
my 
role, including
development of government policy on the safety and
supply of blood and blood products to the NHS;
sponsorship 
of 
the National Blood Authority 
... the
Better Blood Transfusion initiative; development of
 
15
measures to reduce the risk of vCJD and 
HCV transmission
through blood, including funding of measures introduced
by 
National Blood Service and the provision of
recombinant clotting factors for people with
haemophilia."
I'll come back to ask you a handful of questions
about vCJD and recombinant factor products
:
"Ensuring sufficiency of supplies of key blood
products for UK patients
, 
including sourcing of blood
plasma supply from the US
.
"
And I'll come back 
and
 
ask
 you a handful of
questions about that
:
"Negotiating and implementing a new EU Blood
Directive on standards and quality of blood
; 
drafting
responses for ministers on calls for compensation and
a public inquiry into the contamination of blood with
HCV."
I'll come back to ask you questions about both of
those issues
.  
And
:
"
Sponsorship of the Alliance House charities, the
AHOs."
Again, I'll come back and ask you a handful of
questions in relation to the AHOs as well.
Now
, 
we can see the broad range of matters that
you were involved in, and you've told us in your witness
 
16
statement that the Unit was understaffed.  Can you
explain to us what problems that caused for you and your
colleagues on a practical level?

--Result #79--

I think that depend
ed
 on the size of the issues.  
So
 
19
there were certain 
things
 that absolutely 
had
 to go to
ministers, so decisions on issues, anything to do with
spending public money.
So
, 
for
 
example
, all the submissions about whether
to find the money for recombinant clotting factors or
 --
not covered in the evidence
, 
but for NAT testing, 
for
example
; 
issues that involved previous decisions taken
by ministers, so further discussion on the compensation
issue, 
for
 
example
.  
Anything that 
was
 going to go
public from the Department needed to go through
ministers.
So a whole range of -- if anything involving
anything legislative, anything involving anything going
to Parliament
, 
so a whole range of things which
, 
from my
experience as a civil servant
, 
I knew required
ministerial decision.  And then I would take a view on
whether an issue had wider implications that needed
senior input.

--Result #80--

Yes,
 this is my attempt to summarise the various
statements that ministers made over the period I was
involved, and that first one, 
no
 evidence of wrongdoing
that -- 
that 
the NHS did everything it could
, 
as soon as
it could
, 
I think
, 
was
 the main plank, both on
compensation and on the public inquiry
.

--Result #81--

There was nothing of fundamental significance that was
 

8 June 2022
          
          

  25
not already known
, 
and the relevant facts were in the
public domain
:
"
... 
no
 evidence Parliament had been misled.
"This 
was a problem linked to the state of science
and technology at the time
, 
rather than an
 
isolated UK
problem
, 
and so any inquiry would be unlikely to provide
the 
infected
 
and
 
affected
 with a satisfactory answer.
"
The focus was instead on looking forward on how
to assist the infected and affected with improving their
health and wellbeing.  
An 
inquiry would not help prevent
future transmission.
"
There was concern 
that 
a public inquiry would
raise the profile of potential 
no
-fault compensation at
a time when litigation in the NHS was an
 
increasing
problem.
"
The time that a public inquiry would take to
complete
.
"
Then if we go over the page:
"
The initial trawl of documents 
had
 concluded that
the reason self-sufficiency had not been achieved 
was
due to 
increased
 demand for clotting factors
, 
not
a failure to implement Ministerial initiatives.  On the
contrary, there was evidence significant efforts had
been made to achieve self-sufficiency.
"Self-sufficiency in blood products would not have
 
26
prevented haemophiliacs from being infected with
hepatitis C."
Just pooling those two parts of your statement
together, is it right to understand that
, 
save for the
bit we see at the top of this second page here
, "
the
initial trawl of documents
", 
concluding that the reason
self-sufficiency 
had 
not been achieved was due to
increased demand for clotting factors, save for the work
that was done in investigating that, these lines to take
didn't emerge from new reconsideration by your team of
what 
had
 happened in the past; they were essentially
 --

--Result #82--

There was a distinction and therefore we will not move
to compensation scheme
.

--Result #83--

Or the line 
was
: 
we did all we could as soon as 
we
could
.  
Therefore
, 
there is 
no
 -- there was 
no
negligence on the part of the Government and therefore
no
 justification for compensation because it was
non-negligent harm.

--Result #84--

So you might expect to see then, as you progress through
your tenure, the dropping off of this distinction
between HIV and HCV and going with different lines to
justify the 
no
 compensation scheme
?

--Result #85--

Can we look at another document, then
.  
DHSC0020784_029.
And this is
 -- 
if 
we
 can go, please, 
actually
 to -- this
is -- the front page is an email from Sue Cartwright to
you about Lord Hunt wanting to do something with package
of care for HCV sufferers
.  
But it was 
actually
 page 3
I wanted to draw your attention to.
This is an email from Sue Cartwright to Jane
, 
and
I'm not quite sure who -- to Jane Verity it looks like
,
and to yourself.  The
re are a 
number of people cc'd in,
and it says
 -- 
if we go down the page
: 
"
Jane
/
Charles
,
"
Lord Hunt does 
indeed
 think the 
debate 
will focus
 
47
to
 some extent 
on
 compensation issues
."  
This is in relation to the BSE Inquiry statement
being announced 
"
this Thursday
": 
"... 
announcement 
of a
 substantial compensation
offer
, 
speakers in the debate next 
week
 will probably
want to forecast on compensation for 
[
hepatitis C
]
sufferers
." 
So it says:
"
He 
has 
asked 
if you
 
can
 prepare a note for
[
Secretary of State
]
 this weekend
.  
He said
: 
"
Th
e 
note will need to set out
: 
"1.  
What we can say next week (about compensation
issues) and how this can be differentiated from the BSE
Inquiry compensation
", 
and about a package of care.
Then he says:
"Can you 
let me 
have a 
draft note for SoS for Lord
Hunt ...
 
Then if Lord Hunt agrees the draft 
I will send
it to SoS on Friday for his consideration over the
weekend.  I know that 
you have
 previously set out
a package of care 
(
rather than cash compensation
)
 for
HCV
, 
but I think Lord Hunt is hoping to convince SoS
that there is little difference really between 
the
2 
types of case and to seek his permission to work up
something 
more
 
for
 HCV.
"
Happy to discuss."
 
48
Then I just wanted to ask you whether or not you
recall Lord Hunt being of the view that there was 
no
difference
 -- 
there shouldn't be a differentiation
between those with vCJD and those with HCV in terms of
compensation scheme or financial schemes?

--Result #86--

Do you recall whether you or your civil servant
colleagues shared Lord Hunt's views that there really
was not a sufficient difference between vCJD and HCV to
merit different treatment in terms of compensation
schemes
?

--Result #87--

I can't, in all honesty.  I think the best
representation of my view on 
this 
is that note I wrote
to Yvette Cooper
, 
suggesting possible possibility for
a compensation package.  But I think the sticking point
that kept coming up over this was this issue of whether
giving compensation to people with hepatitis C would
open the floodgates
, 
as it was seen to claims for other
cases involving non-negligent harm.  And that was really
the sticking point.
I mean again, when we get to that submission
,
 

8 June 2022
          
          

  49
I wrote to Yvette Cooper I kind of put an
 
argument that
finds a way around that to see if we can -- I could
persuade ministers to go for something.
But that really 
ended
 up being the sticking point,
I think.

--Result #88--

Perhaps I can ask the question in a different way
.  
One
of the concerns 
that 
the Department had 
had
 -- 
or one of
the lines to take
 -- the Department had 
use
d
 
as a 
reason
for not having 
a compensation scheme was that they
didn't pay out for non-negligent harm, effectively?

--Result #89--

Picking up on the 
point that 
you were 
just 
discussing
just a moment ago
, 
if we go to the bottom of the page,
last bullet point before 
"Timing":
"Although this 
judgement
 only places a legal
obligation on Government to make payments to those
awarded pages by the Courts
, 
it introduces further
questions of inequity and i
n
creases the moral pressure
to do so."
 
56
So is it right 
to understand 
that that is one of
the drivers for 
relooking at 
this 
question
 of
compensation
?

--Result #90--

Then the advice is
, 
at 18:
"If Ministers wish to consider making payments to
haemophiliacs with hepatitis C option
 
v is recommended
",
and the 
reasons are set out
.
It
: 
"a. 
re-establishes the Government's stance on 
no
fault compensation 
...
"b. 
provides an equitable outcome for
haemophiliacs in a way that the Judgment does not
; 
"c. 
effectively diffuses the campaign on behalf of
all haemophiliacs by targeting only those as sick as the
victims of HIV
/
AIDS
;
"d. 
entails relatively modest costs
."  
Then it talks about the impact on the devolved
administrations
 --

--Result #91--

"
What would have happened if the 
no
 fault compensation
scheme had been put in place at the time of the
Judgment?" is the first question.
Second question:
"By giving haemophiliacs money
, 
what other groups
would then want compensation?"
 
and 
the
 
flood
gates point.
Then
, 
if we turn over the page
, 
please
, 
to page 3
: 
"
If we were to make some sort of symbolic gesture
,
what 
could
 that be?  What would a 
money 
package look
like?  What 
kind
 of sums are we talking?"
If we look at paragraph 8, you set out 
--
 
well,
first of all you set out the principles in paragraph
 
7
:
it needs to be affordable and it needs to be acceptable
to the Haemophilia Society
.
Then
, 
at paragraph 8
, 
you say
: 
"
A package which we can be fairly confident the
Haemophilia Society 
would
 find acceptable is at

they are infected and a proportion of them could well
come forward if a compensation scheme is announced.  It
is likely that the existence of a scheme would encourage
people who have had a blood transfusion to seek an
 
HCV
test.  For the vast majority there will be 
no
documentary evidence to prove that blood transfusion was
the cause of their infection.  However we would probably
be obliged, if we had a scheme, to award damages on the
basis of probable 
cause
."
Now
, 
leaving aside for the moment the point about
documentary evidence and a scheme awarded on the basis
of probable cause, I want to come and ask you a question
about that in relation to another document.  Was any
consideration given at this stage to trying to trace
those 4,000 to 5,000 patients who you thought were
infect
ed
 with HCV but couldn't be traced?

--Result #92--

I think on compensation
, 
the thought was that Scotland
should follow England.

--Result #93--

We'll come, then, to the point you've just referred to,
Mr Milburn raising the question of whether or not the
compensation scheme was a devolved matter.

--Result #94--

And is it your view that the most significant issue in
moving England towards a hepatitis C compensation scheme
were the developments in Scotland?

--Result #95--

"
People infect
ed
 with hepatitis C 
through
 blood and
 
74
blood products
".  
Then you set out the purpose of the
submission:
"When 
we
 met in September to discuss the campaign
to compensate haemophiliacs with hepatitis C
,
 
you 
took
the view that compensation for this group was not
appropriate but asked us to investigate ex gratia
payments for people infected with hepatitis C through
blood after the introduction of the Consumer Protection
Act who
, 
on the basis of 
... [
the
]
 High Court judgment
,
would have received damages 
had
 they gone to court.
These people are now caught by a time bar preventing
them taking their own legal action under the CPA
.  
"
A care package for haemophiliacs with hepatitis C
on the lines of the one 
developed 
for people with CJD."
It's really what's written over the page on
page 2, and this is under the 
"
Size and the cost of the
scheme
"
 that I want to ask you about, and it's the top
paragraph there, the bit in brackets at the end.
So you're talking there about the total cost of
the scheme, total cost of a scheme, and you say this:
"Although there is unlikely to be any direct
evidence linking these 
individuals' hepatitis
 C
infection with blood, there are precedents for schemes
which award payment if the person has not been exposed
to other known risk factors, eg injecting drug use."
 
75
So we've seen in two documents you making this
point that
 -- 
unlikely to be direct evidence linking
individual
s
' hepatitis C infection with their treatment
.
What was the factual basis upon which you'd arrived at
that conclusion?

--Result #96--

So just reflecting back on the approach taken to the
compensation scheme during your time at the Blood Policy
Unit, was there, to your mind, a serious exploration of
alternative options, ie
 
a real look at reviewing the
policy of 
no
 compensation
?

--Result #97--

Other than the exploration of the issue with
Yvette Cooper and with John Hutton, 
no
, that was the
only occasion where we went back to ministers and said,
"This is what you could do
".  
I mean
, 
we did that,
I certainly did that in the hope that ministers would
decide that they wanted to come up with a scheme, and
I think we pushed it cautiously at first, and then
a little more firmly
 
but
, 
after the decision that
, 
no
,
there wouldn't be a compensation scheme, certainly in my
time
 
there was 
no
 further discussion about it
.

--Result #98--

You've reflected in both your second and third
statements on whether or not there was a collective
mindset or a groupthink in the Department about issues
such as public inquiry, the HCV compensation scheme.
What do you mean by a collective mindset or
a groupthink
?

--Result #99--

I think the point I make in my second witness statement
when
 
I 
refer to this is that
, 
looking back on this,
I asked myself whether I could have, you know, done
anything differently, and I said I wasn't honestly sure
that I could have done.  And I think that's where I am
still at, that
, 
although we might have all felt that we
were right about this, that, you know, there wasn't
a case to answer
, 
that there wasn't a case for
compensation
, 
that there wasn't a case for a public
inquiry, I'm not sure that I was in a position, you
know, as a middle
-
ranking civil servant
, 
with views
taken by many more senior people and by ministers
, 
to
challenge that, even if it had occurred to me to do
that
.

--Result #100--

I'm not sure it would have been necessarily more
effective.  It certainly would have put pressure,
perhaps, on ministers
.  
But
, 
in the same way that, you
know, ministers resisted calls for compensation over
many years, despite very effective campaigning by the
Haemophilia Society and others.  They could, 
I guess
,
have -- this is speculation, but they could have
similarly resisted campaigns by the Macfarlane Trust.

--Result #101--

  
Before we start this afternoon, can I just
correct something for the transcript and for everyone
that's listening.
I 
was
 asking Mr Lister about a document,
a submission that was sent to Yvette Cooper.  We don't
need to look at it
, 
but it's DHSC0041379_
177, 
and
I asked
: 
why did that go to Yvette Cooper rather than
the Secretary of State?  It was given 
that
 it was
a submission about HCV compensation scheme.  It has been
pointed out to me that it was addressed to Yvette Cooper
but also to the Secretary of State.  I just want
ed
 to
make that clear.
The
 second thing before I ask you some questions
about vCJD and recombinant, Mr Lister, is I understand
that you've been reflecting over lunch about one of the
questions I asked you before lunch and would like to
update us on your reflections, if I can put it that way.

--Result #102--

Yes
.  
You 
asked
 me why I thought ministers refused the
idea of a compensation scheme, and I was trying to think
back to the context of that period, the new Labour
administration that, you know, in
 -- 
but ministers at
that time were having to take some very, very difficult
decisions about priorities on public spending.  The
Blair administration decided for its first 
two

spending limits so that by 1999
,
 I think
,
 public
spending was at the lowest since the early 
'60s.  
But at
the same time
, 
the NHS 
was
 in major difficulty
.  
There
was a big
, 
big crisis over waiting times.  I mean
, 
far
too
 many people were dying because they were on waiting
lists, and it was one 
of
 those issues that ministers
were determined to tackle
.  
And there were a lot 
of
other issues as well around poor outcomes for people
with heart disease
, 
poor outcomes for people with
cancer.
And I think trying to put myself in the shoes of
ministers at that time, their overwhelming priority was
to improve those, you know, critical frontline NHS
services.  So they were constantly having to decide
whether to fund something that would take money away
from those frontline services or not.  And I think
that's the context you probably have to think about
minister
s
' deliberations on this
.  
You know
: 
do I take
money for a compensation scheme away from the money that
would otherwise go into frontline NHS services?  And my
feeling is that that would have been, you know, what was
upmost in their mind.

--Result #103--

In relation to the questions I asked you about the
submission that you did for Alan Milburn following his
telephone conversation with Malcolm Chisholm, about the
Scottish compensation scheme.  What was your primary
concern at that stage?  Was it whether there was
a devolved power or was it the ability to debate,
thoroughly debate the immediate impact of any such
scheme on the other UK countries
, 
and the wider
implications for the handling of future compensation
claims?
In other words, did the Department truly consider
this to be an
 
issue of devolution, reserved competency,
or was it more the case of political inexpediency for
Westminster more generally
, 
in light of the position
taken by that government over the years
?

--Result #104--

  
Can I just ask you this
.  
The
impression which you have given me by reference to the
documents, let it be said, earlier in your evidence was
this: that the ministers in London, the ministers of the
UK Government, were determined to hold 
the
 line against
extending compensation to those who had suffered
 
170
hepatitis infection through blood transfusion
.
Ministers in Scotland rather wanted there to be a form
of payment for those who 
had
 suffered in that way.
And so you have ministers in London not wanting to
be bounced
, 
as might inevitably happen
 
if Scotland went
alone, into doing what they didn't really want to do but
might have to do in response to public opinion.  And one
way of -- the ministers might have been looking for ways
in which they could at least have a debate with Scotland
to see if they could persuade them to do otherwise
, 
or
to stop what they thought was an undesirable
development, and so looked for a possible solution which
was
: 
was it within devolution powers?  If Scotland had
wanted to do what England would also have wanted to do,
devolution wouldn't have come into it, would it?

--Result #105--
 Then we look at the content of it, because it was 
copied to you, and it really helps us, I think, pic k 
up the decision-making process.  So the first 
paragraph explains: 
"I am writing to let you know how I intend to 
handle the issue of compensation for haemophiliacs 
with the HIV virus and the media campaign which wil l 
be launched shortly on their behalf by the 
Haemophilia Society of Great Britain." 
The next paragraph then explains in the first 
line that:
"... the campaign will be emotive and highly 
charged.  We will be under considerable parliamenta ry 
and public pressure after the Press launch of the 
campaign in early October and no doubt the issue wi ll 
be active during our Party Conference."  
23 There is then a description of the background in 
the next paragraph.  If we go to the bottom of the 
page, Mr Moore says: 
"The question of Government compensation for 
this group was raised specifically when Norman Fowl er 
and Tony Newton gave evidence earlier this year to the 
Social Services Select Committee.  Whilst Norman an d 
Tony made it quite clear how much they sympathised,
the Government's position was that there has never 
been a general State scheme to compensate those who
suffer adverse effects from medical treatment.
Compensation can only be awarded by the courts if 
negligence is proved.  The full range of social 
security benefits are of course available to those 
haemophiliacs who qualify." 
Then he says this: 
"I have looked at the case for compensation 
again carefully in the light of the impending campa ign 
but have concluded that the line taken with the Soc ial 
Services Committee was right.  Any special 
arrangements for compensation could cost a minimum of 
£3 million and could only be funded at the expense of 
other priorities.  Moreover, it is logically diffic ult 
to distinguish the claim by haemophiliacs from the 
claim of many others damaged in the course of their 
24 medical treatment.  And there is no doubt that 
compensating haemophiliacs would lead to pressure 
from many other groups for similar treatment." 
And then he continues: 
"While all of us must have every sympathy for 
haemophiliacs who have been infected with the HIV 
virus, I do not feel it would be wise to set a gene ral 
precedent by accepting that the Government should 
provide a special compensation scheme. 
"I shall be taking steps to ensure that the case 
for not giving compensation is well understood by t he 
media and by our own supporters.
"I am, of course, very ready to discuss this 
issue with you if you so wish." 
Then he explains that he is copying this minute 
to the Lord President, the Secretaries of State for
Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the 
Chief Secretary and to Sir Robert Armstrong.  So th e 
Chief Secretary at that point in time was you?

--Result #106--
 Now, this wasn't a document that called for any 
particular action or decision by the Prime Minister  or 
indeed by you as Chief Secretary.  As far as you ca n 
recall, was this the first time the question of 
compensation had been raised or brought to your                                   
 
                             5 attention?

--Result #107--
 We'll pick that up as we go through the documents. 
Just for the sake of completeness, Lawrence, if we 
have DHSC0004541_141, we have a letter from Number 10,
dated 28 September 1987, which records that:  
26 "The Prime Minister [who was of course at that 
time Mrs Thatcher] has seen, and noted without 
comment, your Secretary of State's minute of 
24 September ..." 
Then we can see that the letter, in turn, was 
copied to the same recipients of the first letter.
Now, that's September '87, I want to pick it up 
then in the next month with a letter you received, 
I think along with many other MPs, from the 
Haemophilia Society.  It's at HSOC0004760_001. 
So this is a letter 12 October 1987, it's from 
the Reverend Tanner who was chairman of the 
Haemophilia Society.  This is a blank version in th e 
sense it's "Dear [blank]", but we'll see from 
subsequent letters that you were one of the recipie nts 
of it.  He says: 
"I am writing to ask for your support in our 
campaign to help the most tragic victims of the AID S 
crisis, people with haemophilia."
The second paragraph then describes, picking it 
up in the second line: 
"A large number of people were infected as 
a result of treatment by commercially produced 
products, mainly drawn from blood donations given i n 
the US and Third World.  Treatment from this source , 
27 with the attendant risks, was required because the UK 
was not, and still is not, self-sufficient in blood
products despite successive Government promises sin ce 
1977." 
The letter then goes on to talk about the 
effects on those who have been infected.  We can se e 
those listed, I don't propose to read them out.  Th e 
Reverend Tanner explains: 
"57 have AIDS and 41 have died.
"All of this -- in addition to haven't to cope 
with a life threatening disorder  -- haemophilia.  
"The Government is responsible for this 
situation.  All these people were infected as a res ult 
of treatment through the NHS ..."
Then he adds: 
"... despite the House of Commons Social 
Services Committee accepting that:
"'Calls for compensation for haemophiliacs and 
others who have become HIV positive as a consequenc e 
of infected blood transfusion and for special life 
insurance arrangements for haemophiliacs deserve 
careful consideration.' 
"The Government has not, as yet, volunteered any 
form of support, financial or otherwise.  At presen t 
they are hiding behind the cloak of the courts in  
28 saying that they are not liable for compensation. 
However, there is a clear moral case that the 
Government should provide recompense." 
Then he sets out further details in that regard. 
Now, we can see, I think, that you undoubtedly 
received that letter from HSOC0003584.  This is you
writing -- is this correct -- in your capacity as M P, 
rather than as Chief Secretary to the Treasury?

--Result #108--
 When you have a letter like that, you're essentiall y  
32 asking the Government to change its policy.  Minist ers 
just don't do that and remain ministers, it's just not 
the way one behaves.  In terms of private nature, y ou 
may lobby very hard for something but you don't say  -- 
you don't want to get any headlines in the paper,
"Minister X attacks Government policy on Y".  So yo u 
don't say that publicly. 
What I actually said to him at the time was that 
I appreciated the serious nature of the issue, and 
indeed I did, because it was becoming more serious as 
we shall see no doubt in a few moments.  So I was v ery 
sympathetic and remained sympathetic.  But until we
had changed policy it was not appropriate for me as
a minister to indicate that, and nor did I. 
The point about no fault compensation was always 
quite a sound point in terms of precedent.  What wa s 
a much less sound point was the matter I referred t o 
a moment ago, that there are times when your instin cts 
override what is existing policy and then you try a nd 
change policy within Government, because you're 
sympathetic to a particular cause.  Now, if I may s ay 
so, John Moore is no longer with us and the impress ion 
would have been given by the earlier letter from Jo hn 
that you quoted that he was unsympathetic.  
I have to tell you he wasn't, he wasn't                                   
 
                             3 unsympathetic he was echoing the Government's 
effective line on the legality of the issue, whilst
discussing and wondering whether something more sho uld 
be done about it, as did his successors.  And as 
Chief Secretary, of course, I was aware of what the y 
were thinking privately but not saying publicly.  T he 
reason they did that, of course, is because until t hey 
have all of the facts they don't want to inspire ho pe 
that is not met or create controversy that is 
avoidable. 
So it is a circumstance, a system that 
governments from the dawn of time have actually 
operated until a change of policy is privately agre ed. 
Now, at that time, I replied to Mr Watters, and 
I remember his letter, because it came so soon afte r 
the one from the Reverend Tanner.  I was sympatheti c 
of the Government's position -- of the position of the 
Haemophilia Society, and it was being discussed 
privately. 
John Moore had said at one stage there was not 
a good case for compensation for reasons of precede nt. 
He did not rule out, nor did he say he'd ruled out,
compensation in view of the circumstances of those who 
were infected.  That is why his position seemed rat her 
hardline and it was a good deal less hardline, 
34 if I may speak belatedly in his defence, than it 
immediately seemed. 
Pretty soon afterwards, if I recall, 
Tony Newton, who I think was the Minister of State,
and John Moore, were due to meet The 
Haemophilia Society, and they had discussed that wi th 
me and with others before they went.  But only in 
broad outline they said that they were going. 
There were many questions before they went that 
they weren't in a position to answer.  And so 
I advised them to be cautious about those particula r 
questions, because we wished to be sure of our fact s 
before any policy was changed.

--Result #109--
 I can tell you exactly what I meant by it.  Conside r 
the questions that were unanswered and had to be 
answered.  You'll note I didn't say that we shouldn 't 
offer it, I said we shouldn't offer a response unti l 
we'd thoroughly considered the pros and cons of doi ng  
42 it.  And those pros and cons were principally how m uch 
money should it be, to whom should it go, when shou ld 
it go, in what form should it go, what trap doors 
would be open to present and future claims on medic al 
issues, what was the Law Officers' views on the 
implication of offering effectively no fault 
compensation both now and the future?
Now, there was no suggestion, I think either by 
them or by me, that there wasn't going to be some 
compensation but we had to be aware of what we were
doing, if we were going to get the compensation rig ht 
and how we dealt with it right.  And, frankly, the 
Department of Health should have examined that matt er 
with the Chief Secretary before they had their meet ing 
with The Haemophilia Society, but they hadn't done so.
I think the meeting had come in a bit of a rush for
one reason or another, and they hadn't done so. 
But before we could decide what help should be 
given and how the help should be given and to whom the 
help should be given and in what form, we had to 
answer those particular questions, and that was the
purpose of my cautionary letter to them, saying, 
"Listen now, and then when you come back we can 
discuss further".

--Result #110--
 I don't think the Government gained very much of th e 
sort of the horror people were facing.  I mean, the re 
is no amount of compensation you can give that coul d 
actually compensate for what had happened to them. 
What had happened to them was incredibly bad luck, 
awful, and it was not something that anybody was 
unsympathetic to.

--Result #111--
 Just to carry through the decision-making in relati on 
to the requests that had come from Tony Newton and 
John Moore, we can see then that the matter was 
considered by the Cabinet Subcommittee on AIDS on 
10 November 1987.  Could we have CABO0100016_011,  
44 please? 
This is the set of minutes of the meeting held 
on 10 November 1987, "Cabinet Home and Social Affai rs 
Committee Subcommittee on AIDS", and we can see if we 
look at those attending, it's chaired by 
Lord Whitelaw, then we have a number of 
Secretaries of State in attendance.  If we just go 
slightly down, we can see John Moore was there and you 
were there in your capacity as Chief Secretary to t he 
Treasury.  We also have a reference there to 
Donald Acheson, the Chief Medical Officer, being in
attendance.  If we could go, please, Lawrence to 
page 6, we can see the heading "Special Financial 
Assistance for Haemophiliacs".  Then the minutes 
record: 
"The subcommittee considered a Memorandum by the 
Secretary of State ... on whether the Government 
should provide special financial assistance for 
haemophiliacs." 
Now, I'm not going to take you to the memorandum 
but, for the sake of the transcript, so that others
can look at it if they wish to, it's JEVA0000021.  In 
fact, the minutes largely set out what it was that 
John Moore was saying. 
If we pick it up just in that                                   
 
                             5 paragraph beginning "The Secretary of State for Soc ial 
Services said", it's about nine lines down, Sir Joh n, 
where it's recorded: 
"He had continued the policy of his predecessor 
in resisting special financial assistance for 
haemophiliacs infected by HIV on the ground that th ere 
had never been a general state scheme to compensate
those who had suffered adverse effects from medical
treatment.  However, he was now very clearly of the
view that the position was not sustainable unless 
concessions were made.  The Haemophilia Society ...
had recently launched a campaign for Government 
compensation ... this had attracted a great deal of
support in Parliament and elsewhere.  The Society h ad 
been given advice by Counsel that it was most unlik ely 
that liability could be proved against the Governme nt 
but they had successfully got across their contenti on 
that the moral fault lay with the Government for 
failing to secure self-sufficiency in blood product s. 
Whilst this was a tendentious argument, it was 
difficult to refute it convincingly." 
Just pausing there, Sir John, before we look at 
the rest of the document and the rest of the 
discussion, you'll recall that the letters that we 
looked at from The Haemophilia Society, rather than 
46 simply calling for no fault compensation, had actua lly 
made out a case of fault, not necessarily legal 
liability, but fault on the part of the Government or 
the NHS for failing to secure self-sufficiency in 
blood products.  We see John Moore then saying, 
describing that as a "tendentious argument" but 
"difficult to refute it convincingly".
It's not clear, I think, from the 
contemporaneous documentation that certainly I've s een 
what was meant by that or what investigations had b een 
undertaken as to the alleged failure to secure 
self-sufficiency.  Do you recall that being a subje ct 
of concern or discussion?

--Result #112--
 Risks to Government spending from other completely 
unrelated claims once we had broken the dam of not 
paying out for no fault -- no legal fault 
compensation.  Once we moved to an ex gratia paymen t,
we had opened up, potentially, a whole range of oth er 
options where people may come to the Government or sue 
the Government or whatever in terms of getting 
compensation for something wholly unrelated to heal th, 
as well as conceivably related to other aspects of 
health.  That's what it's about.  It's the same 
argument about no legal fault compensation.

--Result #113--
   So before we move to 1989, just picking up 
upon the last matter I was asking you about.  I thi nk,
for the sake of completeness, rather than necessari ly 
because it gives rise to a question, I wanted to ju st 
put up on screen Tony Newton's announcement of the 
payment of the £10 million in Parliament, it's 
LDOW0000241, please, Lawrence. 
We can see the date of the announcement is 
16 November 1987, and we can see, on the left-hand 
column, it's being made by Tony Newton and if we ju st 
go a little further down that column, please, 
Lawrence, we can see the penultimate paragraph on t he 
screen:  
64 "The grant of £10 million is being made from the 
reserve." 
So there is the announcement.  Can we just go 
back to the whole page, please?  You'll then see, 
Sir John, and Chair, bottom of the page, Robin Cook
responds, and if go to the top of the next column, 
please, we can see the question being asked by 
Robin Cook was: 
"Will the Minister explain how he has costed the 
fund and come up with £10 million, or was it 
a convenient round figure?  Is he aware that, per 
head, it represents just over £8,000 for every pers on 
infected and that that is less than half the capita l 
sum that is paid by his Department in the cases of 
vaccine damage?  Is he satisfied that such a modest
sum is enough, particularly when the most pressing 
need for the families of the victims is to keep a r oof 
over their heads by clearing a mortgage." 
Then in the next paragraph, Robin Cook asks if 
the Minister will undertake to review with The 
Haemophilia Society the size of the fund.  And then
Mr Newton's answer, if we just go a little further 
down the column, he says, in the second paragraph: 
"On a number of occasions I have commented on 
the difficulty of a compensation scheme.  This is n ot                                   
 
                             5 a compensation scheme.  That must be made clear.  I t 
is a recognition of a special and unique combinatio n 
of circumstances, and I am glad to make that 
recognition. 
"On the matter of the £10 million, we arrived at 
a broad estimate of a sum that we felt would give 
significant help to the group affected, recognising
that to calculate in terms of a specific sum per 
individual would not take account of the great 
differences between the circumstances of the 
individuals affected.  That is one reason why we ha ve 
not attempted to have a regulated scheme.  For 
example, some may be young single men, others may b e 
older men with families, and so on.  On that basis we 
have arrived at this sum and this flexibility of 
scheme." 
Then he says in the next paragraph: 
"It will be up to the society [which is of 
course the Macfarlane Trust ultimately] to decide h ow 
to administer the £10 million."  
There is then a debate that continues with some 
expressing the view that the sum was less than 
adequate, or rather Scrooge-like.  But that's the 
Parliamentary debate, in any event, for the sake of
completeness. 
66 Sir John, if there is any comment you wish to 
make on that, please do.  I don't have a specific 
question I just wanted to draw attention to it to 
complete the issues we were looking at before the 
break?

--Result #114--
 So if we move then two years forward in time to the
autumn of 1989, by which time you had taken up the 
post of Chancellor of the Exchequer.  If we can sta rt 
with HMTR0000001_005. 
Now, this is a minute from Mr Saunders in the 
Treasury, dated 13 November 1989, and it is, as 
I understand your statement, addressed to your 
Principal Private Secretary.  The heading is "Autum n 
Statement: Haemophiliacs and AIDS", and it says in the 
first paragraph: 
"You asked for a line to take should the 
question be raised of compensation for haemophiliac s 
who contracted AIDS through treatment with infected
blood products.  The following is based on briefing
which was supplied for Prime Minister's Questions 
yesterday." 
Then the line to take is that essentially it's  
67 a matter for the Secretary of State for Health.  Th ere 
is reference then to the £10 million: 
"The Department of Health has always made clear 
that if representations were made that further 
contritions were necessary, it would always be 
prepared to consider them." 
Then if we just go over the page, we can pick it 
up under the heading "Not For Use", so this, I thin k, 
is for your background information, rather than for
public dissemination.  Paragraph 5 refers to 
consideration being given by Mr Clarke: 
"... who was said to be sceptical about the need 
for any further payment ... Mrs Bottomley is said t o 
think that the Government must be seen to be doing 
more." 
Now, this is the genesis of what became 
a further payment to the Macfarlane Trust in late 
1989.  As I understand it, Sir John, you don't know  if 
you saw this at the time, but you think you would h ave 
probably had some form of discussion with the 
Chief Secretary, who by then was Norman Lamont, abo ut 
it; is that right? 

--Result #115--
 No.  There is attached to the document that we're j ust 
about to look at there, is a later version of the 
draft letter which doesn't include any reference to
you, so I don't think -- it's by no means clear 
whether there was a discussion with you.
So this is 15 October and there is a reference 
to there are going to be debates in Parliament in t he 
House of Commons and the House of Lords. 
I just want to pick up paragraph 2:
"Department of Health officials assure me the 
Government line on both occasions will remain exact ly 
as it has been hitherto.  There will be no suggesti on 
that the Government might be willing to negotiate a n 
out-of-court settlement." 
So this is really just to show the chronology  
87 of events, Sir John, in the weeks before you became
Prime Minister.  So that's the position set out in 
this minute.
Then if we look at DHSC0046936_035, please, we 
can see this is 16 October 1990.  
And if we go just a little further down the 
page, please, Lawrence, right-hand column, we have 
Mr Wallace asks a question: 
"Does the Prime Minister agree that the 
honourable and decent way forward in the tragic cas e 
of the 1,200 haemophiliacs suffering from the AIDS 
virus to is to offer far more generous compensation
than has been the case up to now, rather than 
continuing to fund ever-increasing fees for lawyers  to 
argue the toss over the matter?"
Then we have the Prime Minister's answer: 
"The Government have already made available some 
£34 million to the haemophiliacs who are suffering 
from this very grievous happening, as an ex gratia 
payment without prejudice to their taking legal act ion 
in the courts.  Obviously, we wish to know the lega l 
position before any further payment is considered."
So I don't have a question for you, Sir John, 
that's to show where things have got to by the midd le 
of October 1990.  
88 Now, you became Prime Minister 28 November 1990. 
But before we look at, then, how this issue came to
your attention as Prime Minister, can you just help  us 
a little with understanding more the organisation o f 
Number 10, and how it might be that decisions or 
documents might come to you as Prime Minister and w hat 
might not be put before you.  Was there any particu lar 
rule of thumb?

--Result #116--
 Now, around a week after you became Prime Minister,
Mr Waldegrave, who was Secretary of State for Healt h,
wrote to you, and if we can just follow through the
correspondence over the days that then followed. 
We start with HMTR0000002_016, please, Lawrence.
So this is addressed to you.  If we go to the 
second page first of all, we can see it's dated 
5 December 1990 and it's "WW", so William Waldegrav e. 
If we go back to the preceding page, we can see 
Mr Waldegrave said this: 
"Further to your exchange with Terrence Higgins 
at yesterday's Questions, I am writing to let you k now 
the current position on the HIV litigation involvin g 
haemophiliacs." 
Then he sets out a number of points by way of 
background.  The third paragraph refers to the two 
payments previously made.  The fourth 
paragraph explains: 
"However, around 770 infected haemophiliacs and 
190 of their partners and close relatives are suing
the Government and the Health Authorities for damag es, 
alleging negligence. 
91 "The main Court hearing has been set or March 
1991, and is expected to last for six months.  The 
trial judge took the exceptional step of suggesting
that both sides should consider a compromise 
settlement.  In its formal rejection, the Departmen t 
said that the moral and compassionate arguments had
already been recognised by the Government, and drew
attention to the dangers of creating an expectation
that all those injured as an unintended effect of N HS 
treatment would receive compensation without having  to 
prove negligence.  However, the co-ordinating 
committee for the Plaintiffs' solicitors have now p ut 
forward a proposal which would, in effect, involve 
a total cost to the Government of some £50 million.
This is very much earlier than their earlier propos al 
of nearly £100m, and may, I am advised, represent t he 
fact that the 'doves' amongst their lawyers are 
temporarily in the ascendant over the 'hawks'.  We 
therefore have a choice before us which I am about to 
discuss with Chief Secretary and about which I will
then want to minute you.  Legal costs of going on m ay 
be £20m or so.  Political costs are high.  On the 
other hand, precedents are dangerous.  The purpose of 
this note is not to ask for a decision (since I hav e 
not yet had my meeting with HMT and the costs and  
92 benefits of either course are therefore not yet 
agreed) but to warn you that the last occasion when
a decision other than to fight it out could be take n,
is going to occur in the next few days.  Meanwhile,
obviously, we must play a dead bat." 
And so obviously I can ask Lord Waldegrave, as 
he now is, about that when he gives evidence next 
week.  But that's the minute he sent to you on 
5 December, not asking for any particular action or
decision on your part yet.  Is it likely, given it is 
directly from a minister to you, that you would hav e 
seen that?

--Result #117--
 And then just one final document on this issue of h ow 
the announcement was made. 
HMTR0000002_023. 
This is a minute from Strachan Heppell in the 
Department of Health to Mr Edwards in the Treasury.
It's 12 December 1990.  If we just look at text bef ore 
we look at the handwriting, it says: 
"I attach a copy of the press release which the 
plaintiffs' Steering Committee put out yesterday 
afternoon.
"You will see from this that while the Steering 
Committee comment that the figures do not represent
proper compensation in moral terms, they do make it
plain that these are figures that they would be 
prepared to recommend to their clients." 
I don't think I need to read the rest of it. 
If we can just go and look at the handwriting,                                   
 
                             13 I don't think -- if we just look at those who are 
copied first of all, is there anyone here who 
represents Number 10, as far as you can recall?

--Result #118--
 -- shortly before you became Prime Minister 
Mrs Thatcher wrote a letter to Alf Morris, 
2 November 1990.
HSOC0012332. 
So it's in response to a letter from Mr Morris,
enclosing a letter from the general secretary of 
The Haemophilia Society. 
If we just skate down the page, first of all, we 
can see the second paragraph, she says that she is 
appalled by the tragedy, as moved as everyone else by 
the plight of those infected.  
116 The next paragraph says: 
"... never disputed our moral responsibility to 
pay attention to the needs of the victims and their
families.""Disputed our moral responsibility to pay
attention to the needs of the victims and their 
families." 
Then the last paragraph on that page says:And 
then the last paragraph on that page says: 
"Despite our promise to keep under review the 
£34 million already made available, many haemophili acs 
have decided to pursue legal proceedings alleging 
negligence against the ... Government, the licensin g 
authorities [et cetera] ... The case is before the 
Courts.""Despite our promise to keep under review t he 
34 million already made available many haemophiliac s 
have decided to pursue legal proceedings alleging 
negligence against Government Licensing Authorities , 
et cetera, the case is before the courts." 
Over the page, Mrs Thatcher sets out the 
successive Government policy in relation to no-faul t 
compensation.  I don't propose to read out that lon g 
passage. 
Then in the last paragraph, she says: 
"I am sorry if this is a disappointing reply but 
the Government is showing its great concern for                                   
 
                             17 haemophiliacs with HIV, by the ex gratia payments i t 
is making.  The question of compensation has to rem ain 
a matter for the Courts to decide." 
So that's Mrs Thatcher's position not long 
before you take over as the Prime Minister.  And, a s 
we've seen, one of your first steps as Prime Minist er 
was to agree to what Mr Waldegrave was putting forw ard 
to you as a compromise of the HIV litigation. 
To what extent was the change in Government, and 
Mrs Thatcher being replaced by you, a factor in the
settlement of the case?

--Result #119--
 Then can I just finally ask you about one comment y ou 
make in your autobiography on this issue.  
So if we go back to RLIT0001628, please, and we 
go to page 7 of the document. 
The bottom of the page, you say this: 
"Another priority ..." 
So this the last paragraph, Sir John:
"... less specific perhaps, was tolerance;
a Conservative value which some Tories overlooked, and 
which I aimed to restore to the fold.  Two swift ac ts 
set the course: I decided to unfreeze Child Benefit
payments (this was achieved, at my request, in 
Norman Lamont's first budget), and to compensate 
haemophiliacs who had been infected with the HIV vi rus 
as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.  Bo th 
of these decisions achieved a certain notoriety, an d 
were seen by some as signs that I was breaking with
what had gone before.  This was a characteristicall y  
119 false history.  The broad tradition of our party wa s 
tolerant." 
Then you say this: 
"If a certain shrill and censorious tone had set 
in, it was that tone which broke faith with our pas t. 
My predecessor was not personally unsympathetic, bu t 
some, less tolerant than she, saw 'Thatcherism' as 
a vehicle for intolerance and, sometimes, prejudice ." 
Now, I'm going to ask you about what you say is 
the role of tolerance within the Conservative Party , 
Sir John.  It's the reference to, in the context of
discussing this very issue in your autobiography th e 
compensation for haemophiliacs infected with HIV, t o 
a "shrill and censorious tone" and some who saw 
Thatcherism as "a vehicle for intolerance and,
sometimes, prejudice".  Who and what did you have i n 
mind there?
Every political party is a coalition.  It 
doesn't matter, any political party of any size is 
a coalition and that is true of the Conservative Pa rty 
as well.  And there are some people in the 
Conservative Party who take what you might kindly c all 
a very hawkish view of social issues: the "everyone
must stand on their own two feet" argument, rather 
than an argument that understands that there is  
120 a responsibility for those who can to help those wh o 
cannot.  I was referring to the minority who took t he 
"stand on your own two feet" argument to extremes. 
Self-evidently in our society, there are a lot 
of people at any time, not least now, who need help
from those who are in a position to give it, and th e 
mainstream of the party I joined was always in favo ur 
of doing that.  I was very much in favour of doing 
that.  It wasn't a universal view inside the 
Conservative, then as now, and it was to that that 
I was referring.

--Result #120--
 But in any event, as I understand your earlier 
evidence, on this particular issue, compensation fo r 
haemophiliacs, you didn't have any particular 
discussions with Mrs Thatcher?

--Result #121--
 We can pick it up in April 1991 at DHSC0002872_001.
DHSC0002872_011, I'm sorry I think I said 0 -- 
my apologies, Lawrence, yes, 011. 
So this is a briefing for Number 10, 
24 April 1991, and we can see it's headed "HIV 
infected blood transfusion recipients" as distinct 
from haemophiliacs, and then we can see there are f ive 
short paragraphs to the briefing, the first is: 
"In general the Government does not accept the 
case for no-fault compensation for medical accident s. 
However, it recognised that special circumstances 
applied to the haemophiliacs with HIV." 
The next paragraph refers to what was said to be 
the double disadvantage for haemophiliacs because o f 
pre-existing haemophilia.  The third paragraph deal s 
with the hereditary nature of haemophilia and the 
implications of that. 
Then the fourth and fifth say this: 
"A similar combination of factors would not 
generally apply to blood transfusion cases. 
"In principle blood transfusion cases are no 
different from other people who suffered from medic al 
accidents or the unintended side effects of  
124 treatment." 
So that was the Government line, if I can put it 
that way, as at 1991.  I'm just going to show you o ne 
other document and then ask you about that line.  I f 
we go to DHSC0002912_009.  This is now the end of 
1991, 2 December 1991, and it's a letter from you t o 
John Marshall MP, and we can see that over the page , 
we can see John Marshall is at the bottom of the pa ge, 
he'd written to you raising this issue with you, as  he 
did, I think, on a number of occasions over the yea rs. 
So your response, if we go back to the previous 
page, if we look in the second and third paragraphs , 
you say: 
"We made clear when we made the settlement in 
the case of haemophiliacs that they were a very 
special case.  The Government has acted accordingly .
I have every sympathy with the plight of those 
non-haemophiliacs who have been infected with HIV a s 
a result of blood transfusions.  But, as you know, the 
House has very recently decided, on a free vote, th at 
it did not support the principle of no-fault 
compensation for medical accidents. 
"Every case of a patient damaged by medical 
treatment represents a human tragedy, but the cogen t 
arguments which led the House to reject the princip le                                   
 
                             25 of no-fault compensation apply, I believe, also in 
this case." 
So you were, as I read this letter, Sir John, is 
this right, effectively holding the Government line , 
maintaining the Government line?

--Result #122--
 If we go over the page, this is Mr Kinnock, as he t hen 
was, in a letter to you: 
"Dear Prime Minister, you will know of the most  
128 recent exchanges in the House on the subject of 
compensation for non-haemophiliacs who have 
accidentally been infected with HIV during blood 
transfusion or tissue transplants. 
"Like many other Members of Parliament and of 
the general public, I had expected that the Governm ent 
would by now have provided compensation for these 
tragic victims of accident.  I was surprised and 
dismayed, therefore, to see that Virginia Bottomley
has said that the Government would not make provisi on 
for the non-haemophiliacs on the same basis as the 
HIV-infected haemophiliacs, even though it is obvio us 
that both groups were victims of similar and seriou s 
treatment errors. 
"Making provision for the non-haemophiliacs 
would be elementary justice.  Far from involving 
'untold expenditure' as Mrs Bottomley claimed, it 
would involve a relatively modest sum and be 
completely justifiable as a way of at least easing the 
economic disadvantage suffered by the people afflic ted 
by HIV. 
"I must appeal to you that except on moral and 
logical grounds there should be compensation for th ese 
unfortunate people and ask you to take immediate 
action to see that it is paid."                                   
 
                             29 I think, top of the page, there is some 
handwriting, which I don't think we can clearly 
discern what that is, but was that your handwriting ?

--Result #123--
 Now, you had a meeting on 4 February with Mr Marsha ll 
and others.  We can look at it briefly for the sake  of 
completeness, it's CABO0000044_023.  So this is, 
again, from Mr Chapman, it's addressed to the 
Department of Health, and it refers to the meeting 
that took place the day before with a group of MPs who 
are there named and who include Mr Marshall. 
It records a number of points made by the 
delegation, I'm not going to go through the detail of 
those.
Bottom of the page, this records your response: 
"The Prime Minister expressed his personal 
sympathy for those affected.  He had to be concerne d,
however, that the case could set a precedent and he lp 
to lead to no-fault compensation.  Given the state of 
the art of blood screening at the time, it was                                   
 
                             33 difficult to say conclusively that the NHS was at 
fault.  It would be helpful if a clear, robust 
position on ring-fencing could be established.  If 
compensation were agreed, recipients would need to 
undertake, as the haemophiliacs have done, that the y 
would not pursue extra compensation through the 
courts." 
Then, over the page: 
"The Prime Minister agreed to consider the 
matter further and to discuss it with your 
Secretary of State and the Chief Secretary." 
So is it right to understand this letter as 
essentially saying that you were not opposed to the
provision of financial assistance, provided it didn 't 
set a precedent for other cases?

--Result #124--
 If we start with DHSC0004498_143.  So this is 
a Number 10 letter to the Department of Health, 
November 1995.  It says here, under the heading 
"Haemophilia and Hepatitis C": 
"You will recall that we discussed the 
possibility of the Prime Minister meeting a delegat ion 
of Conservative MPs, led by John Marshall, to discu ss 
the case for compensation for haemophiliacs who hav e 
contracted the Hepatitis C virus. 
"The Prime Minister remains unconvinced that it 
would be sensible for him to meet the delegation.
However, in light of the recent concern expressed b y 
a large number of MPs, the Prime Minister would lik e 
to consider the case for a meeting more carefully.  To 
assist him, I should be grateful for a short briefi ng 
on the issue, to include a summary of the line he 
might take in such a meeting." 
Now, we'll look at a handful of documents in 
a moment, Sir John, about decision-making, but this
might suggest that essentially you, Number 10, was 
really being led by the Department of Health, or th e 
Department of Health was leading on this issue, and
setting the policy; is that right?

--Result #125--
 I think in terms of hepatitis C, there were two 
reasons.  Inevitably, in everything any Government 
does, there is a fiscal view, either it is easily 
granted or it isn't.  And, in the financial positio n 
of the 1990s, very little was easily granted.  So o f 
course there would have been a fiscal element.
There is also the comparison between the 
position of haemophiliacs themselves and haemophili acs 
with HIV, and those with hepatitis C, which, as The
Haemophilia Society themselves conceded in letters,
was a far lesser risk and, as the medical advice we
received, and they received, confirmed that was the
case. 
So it would have probably been -- and I'm 
assuming what was in the Department of Health's min d 
because they didn't set it out in a note to me -- I 'm 
assuming it was a combination of those two things t hat 
they were referring to in terms of the innate 
resistance.                                   
 
                             41 They may also have been referring to a third 
thing, and that was the innate resistance in 
Parliament as a whole to the vote against no-fault 
compensation in a private members' bill that had be en 
taken some time before.

--Result #126--
 Well, I've no recollection of it but, of course, I' ve 
read the papers again and looked at it, so I'm 
familiar with the position that was taken then.  An d 
the position that I must have taken then, though if
you ask me whether I actually remember it, the answ er 
is that I don't. 
I think we were infected -- affected by the 
usual arguments that I have repeated again and agai n 
about no-fault compensation.  But beyond that we we re 
influenced, undoubtedly, by medical opinion advisin g 
us that hepatitis C sufferers were in a very differ ent 
position overall from those who previously had been 
143 granted compensation.  And I think the information we 
were given as to the number of deaths was -- every 
death is tragic but it was wholly different from th e 
information from the delegation of senior conservat ive 
MPs that you referred to a moment ago, and very, ve ry 
different. 
There were other factors, I think, at the time. 
The British Government wasn't the only Government i n 
refusing compensation to hepatitis C victims, 
presumably for the same reasons.  Almost every othe r 
country and maybe all of them, I can't be certain o f 
that, did not offer compensation to patients 
contracting hepatitis C, and I dare say that would 
have been a significant factor.  And, of course,
the information we had from the Haemophilia Society
itself, Graham Barker's letter to Arthur [redacted in 
statement] ** is a case in point.  If you have that  to 
hand, it illustrates the distinction between the tw o. 
So it would have been a combination of those 
things.  I don't know in retrospect whether that wa s 
the right decision, it's impossible to know.  You t ake 
the decisions with the focus of immediate events, y ou 
look at them later a good deal in retrospect, and y ou 
wonder on a number of fronts: was I wrong, perhaps by 
being too under-generous?  Was I wrong with being t oo  
144 overgenerous?  
I've never been entirely certain with 
hepatitis C whether we took the right decision then , 
but that was the one that we took.  Suffice to say,  if 
I remember rightly, ten years later I think 
hepatitis C patients were granted some compensation . 
I don't know how much -- 

--Result #127--
 Well, if the Government considered everything it di d 
in a public inquiry it would be rather a heavy burd en 
to undertake for everyone.                                   
 
                             65 I think the way they normally come about is when 
the Prime Minister of the day is approached and 
requested either by the people who seek it or by 
people lobbying on their behalf, and a case is made  to 
him or her that there should be a public inquiry.  No 
such case was made to me.  To the best of my 
recollection it was not mentioned to me at any stag e. 
And since most of the time I was Prime Minister we 
were actually in the business of dealing with the 
problem of haemophiliacs and providing compensation , 
or HIV sufferers and providing compensation, and bl ood 
and tissue sufferers and providing compensation, th e 
issue itself didn't arise.  And it certainly didn't
arise, nor was I at that time aware that other 
countries had public inquiries, and none of those 
public inquiries reported during the time I was in 
Government.  So it really was, because we were 
actively involved in it for most of the time, simpl y 
not an issue that arose.  Nobody mentioned it to me
within the Department of Health who might have done , 
or from the Treasury who might have done, or from t he 
Haemophilia Society, who were more likely to have d one 
it.  So I was never called upon to consider the iss ue. 
And since I considered it most of the time until 
the very end of my time in Government, over the  
166 last 18 months or so, I didn't consider it myself 
without a request to do so.  I had no request to do
so, and so I didn't consider it.  I thought we were
actively dealing with the matter, and it was only 
later, in retrospect, in fact very many years later , 
that the decision -- 20 years after I left office i n 
fact -- before it was decided that there should be 
a public inquiry.

--Result #128--
 Well, I think a new precedent has been established now 
of ex gratia payments, so I don't think you can get
away from the danger of no-fault compensation, but 
there has now been a way to go around it, and deal 
with cases where there is a special requirement 
because of an event that may not have been the dire ct 
fault of a government or government's servants in a ny 
capacity, but where compensation is merited.  And 
I think the ex gratia payment proposal that was 
developed will meet that in future.

--Result #129--
 Well, there are two aspects of that.  The first one  is 
the social security payments, which plainly stand o n 
their own, quite apart from -- I think "compensatio n" 
179 is the wrong word, actually.  "Ex gratia payments"
would be a more accurate way.  It isn't compensatio n. 
Compensation in terms of -- you cannot 
compensate, there is no way you can compensate for 
what happened to the victims of the blood tragedy, you 
cannot compensate them, it wouldn't matter whatever
you did for them or paid them, there is no 
compensation for the way their lives were wrecked, 
let's be entirely clear about that.  So I think 
"compensation" isn't the right term. 
An ex gratia payment is probably a more accurate 
way, but I'm not sure that there is a word that you
couldn't take offence to if you wished to.  So -- b ut 
it certainly isn't compensation, which these days h as 
also come to be used as a narrative for salary as 
well: your compensation for doing your job is £X
a year.  So certainly we should get away from the u se 
of the word "compensation" because it doesn't and i t 
can't.

--Result #130--
 Well, it didn't.  I mean, the things that were in 
train at the time of the election were the Maastric ht 
Agreement, which had been wildly well received when
first made and subsequently came under huge critici sm,
particularly from within the Conservative Party.  T hat 
produced a divided party and was a significant issu e. 
Then there was the question of rising inflation, 
falling house prices and the other economic problem s 
that arose from events in the '80s, but carried the
recession right into the early years of the '90s. 
Those were the mega-issues of the campaign.  And I can 
honestly say that the decision on compensation -- o n 
a payment at that stage was not affected by the 
forthcoming general election and did not affect the
election in any material way. 

--Result #131--
   But it brings me really to just two 
aspects of what you've said, that were perhaps 
intriguing.  You were asked earlier this morning ab out 
something that John Moore said, and you said this, 
that John Moore had said, at one stage, that there was 
not a good case for compensation for reasons of 
precedent.  He did not rule out, nor did he say he' d 
ruled out, compensation in view of the circumstance s 
of those who were infected.  Can I just look with y ou 
for a moment at the question of precedent and how i t 
interacts with special circumstances? 
Precedent, I suppose, involves two things.  One 
may be looking back to the past and seeing if it's 
been done before or not been done before, so there is 
a precedent, either for doing it or not doing it.  It 
may also be a fear for establishing, by doing it fo r 
the first time, as you may think, that it may happe n  
191 again and there may be a call for it to happen agai n,
and so you may be establishing a precedent for the 
future.  Those two sides. 
But in either case, however one views precedent, 
it only applies, doesn't it, if the facts in each c ase 
are sufficiently similar, or the principle which 
underlies them, to apply to both cases?

--Result #132--
 Well, it was the principle that was concerning the 
Government, the principle that unless there had bee n 
shown to be a legal requirement to pay, because of 
misbehaviour in some form by the Government agency,
then there had been no occasion when there had been
compensation.  The reference to no-fault compensati on 
was based on the principle that that had never 
happened before, governments collectively, of all 
parties, as far back as one could trace, had never 
agreed in the principle of no-fault compensation. 
If the Government had made a failure, either 
they agreed compensation or it went to court and th ey 
were forced to pay compensation.  But to pay 
compensation without having found to be at fault, a nd 
without having gone to court, had not happened befo re, 
and it was that principle which we loosely called 
no-fault compensation.  That was an inherent part o f 
the instincts of the Treasury in particular, but al so  
192 across Government.

--Result #133--
 No, it doesn't, if you can identify those 
circumstances.  But, at the time, there was no 
scientific knowledge that what was being done in th e 
'70s, which was plainly wrong and caused terrible 
tragedies, that it was not known to anybody that th ere 
nothing anyone could have done that would have 
prevented it in the light of what was known by scie nce 
and medicine at that time. 
Now, that's not the case in Aberfan, plainly 
they shouldn't have banked up everything that fell 
down on Aberfan in the 1960s, and so on.  So you co uld 
find a fault and something that could and should ha ve 
been prevented.                                   
 
                             93 With the lack of knowledge, when someone was 
doing something for which there was no knowledge th at 
it went wrong, it was done for the best of motives,
but it was wrong, then nobody could have foreseen 
that, nobody was derelict in their responsibilities . 
And that really is the point that underlies the 
no-fault compensation argument.

--Result #134--
 Well, I think if you can make an exceptional case a nd 
plainly in this case you can, if you seek -- if you
cite a legal obligation that's a very unwise thing to 
do because how can you determine it, the courts may
consider differently.  Indeed, the advice the 
Government got repeatedly, right through the 
compensation packages we produced, was that if we w ent 
to court, if we were taken to court, the balance of
probabilities is that the Government would win the 
case, and that was repeatedly the advice. 
That being so, you are using public money                                   
 
                             97 without a legal justification, so if you cannot hav e 
a legal justification, what is your justification f or 
spending the taxpayers' money and there has to be o ne. 
I would call it a moral obligation; other people ma y 
call it something different.  But I think we have t o 
recognise that those circumstances will occur, and in 
a civilised society, the majority have an obligatio n 
to a minority, if that minority falls on particular ly 
hard times. 
The same principle applies, of course, with 
social security payments.  There is no legal 
obligation to pay a social security payment to some one 
who is unemployed, but there is an obligation in th e 
civilised society to do so.  You can equate that as
a first cousin, perhaps, I might say, to what has 
happened with the ex gratia payments in this 
particular case.

--Result #135--

Then if we go to the penultimate paragraph, so bottom
half of the page, where it says:

 longer be contacted.
In
 
other cases
, 
at a time when 
no
 treatment was
 

8 July 2022
          

  125
available for hepatitis C
, 
patients might have chosen
not to be tested."
Any particular observations
.  
Carol, on that
paragraph?

--Result #136--

If we go over the page, the first paragraph refers to
the public inquiry in the Irish Republic and the
compensation scheme there.  Again, we'll come back to
that
, 
Carol, if that's all right with you.
But the next paragraph then deals with the second of
these three campaign aims
.  
So they dismissed the
request for a public inquiry
.  
This now turns to the
request for financial recompense.
"The Government has met many representatives of the
Haemophilia community since 1997 and listened to their
arguments for a special payment
s
 scheme for people with
haemophilia and hepatitis C similar to that in place for
HIV.  After long and careful consideration at the time,
we came to the same conclusion reached by the previous
Government
 - 
that a special payment
s
 scheme should not
established."
  

--Result #137--

Government were generally meeting with the
representatives of the Haemophilia Society
, 
which
 
139
weren't necessarily representing 
us 
at all
, 
and we that
the evidence that the Society
 -- the Society
, at that
time, didn't want our evidence
, 
and got very angry with
us when we 
discussed
 this evidence
, 
and they wanted to
go for a completely different approach
.
We wanted compensation.  I wrote to them in
'96 about compensation on a parity with Eire.  They
looked
 
at it and then decided to go for a hardship fund.
So 
we
 were completely at odds with the Society.  So the
Government were
, 
in a sense
, 
going to people that didn't
have the evidence, and we kept saying, "You're never
going to get anywhere unless you allow campaigners to be
with you."
What should have happen
ed
 
was 
campaigners should
have gone with the Society to Government, and if the
Society didn't have the evidence, they should have, you
know, given us a route in so we could present that
evidence.  But 
they
, again, blocked all the way.

--Result #138--

Then the next paragraph:
"Succeeding Ministers have reviewed this decision
 
140
and reached the same conclusion
.  
It has also been
debated on numerous occasions in both 
Houses
.  It is not
a view we 
have 
come to lightly.  The Government
 
position
has long since been that as a general rule compensation
should 
not be paid 
when 
there has not been negligence.
We will continue to review the position."
Now, 
obviously that's a
n
 
issue
 that has been
explored with recent witnesses and will continue to be
explored with witnesses over the next three weeks, but
that's the
 "
no
"
 again
.  
So you've had 
"
no
"
 to a public
Inquiry and 
"
no
"
 to any form of financial recompense for
hepatitis C
.

--Result #139--

"Not only are haemophiliacs sick and dying but
spouses/partners are now suffering serious health
 
148
problems as a result of this avoidable 
tragedy
.
"
You have been asked to consider a public inquiry
and have refused us several times with the excuse that
an independent (The Archer Inquiry) and Scottish led
inquiry (Penrose) have shown that no fault 
was found and
but with due respect
 
neither of these had it in their
remit to find anybody liable or demonstrate negligence.
However
, 
that does not mean that negligence by public
bodies did not occur and there is substantial evidence
in the 
possession 
of campaigners 
who can show that gross
safety violations did occur
 
with 
the full knowledge of
government.  In fact Lord Archer had to inform witnesses
that any evidence submitted showing alleged
negligence/liability had to be EXCLUDED
!  
This was the
same for Penrose.  You also said 
'
all the evidence is in
the public domain
'
 
... 
it is certainly NOT in the 2006
DoH Self-Sufficiency report, far from it
!  
We believe
you have been wrongly advised by your 
ministers
 and
civil servants at the Department of Health on the real
facts and truth which has destroyed the lives of
innocent victims and their families.
"
You have it within your power to do what your
predecessor David Cameron said he could do when
questioned by 
Rory Stewart MP during his last PMQs ...
and that is to ENSURE certain measures are carry out."
 
 

8 July 2022
          

  149
Then you set out the extract from Rory Stuart's
contribution, as follows:
"One of the most disturbing scandals has been the
infection of thousands of people across the nation with
HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood.  
Today
Lord
 
Penrose 
publishes
 a report that follows 
nearly
25 years of campaigning by Members 
on
 both sides of this
House to 
address
 this scandal.  Will the Prime Minister
,
as the last
 
act of his Government
, 
ensure that there is
a full 
apology
, transparent compensation and
, 
above all
,
proper compensation for the families 
terribly affected
by this scandal?"
  
You then, you and Colette, set out David Cameron's
reply
, 
as the then Prime Minister
.  
Then underneath that you say this, beneath the bold
print:
"Prime Minister, since this declaration, not only
has nothing been done to improve the lives of victims
and their families but an undemocratic and we believe
unethical and allegedly illegal consultation was forced
on our community
, 
without the full and proper
consultation with ALL campaign groups and in particular
with us."
You refer 
there 
to meetings with Anne Milton
 (
again,
I
 
want to come back to those
)
 and to inadequacies in the
 
150
consultation process.

--Result #140--

Because the Government responded by blocking us on lies
.
Because Lord Archer had given very good recommendations
and one of those, the main one
, 
was compensation on
 

8 July 2022
          

  153
a parity with Eire.  The Government then rejected it by
saying that Eire was different because Eire paid out on
legal liability.  And we knew that that was a lie, so
Colette and I went to Ireland and we contacted the Irish
Government, Irish Haemophilia Society, and the Irish
lawyers that had represented haemophiliacs, and we 
had
letters back saying that in Ireland they'd paid out on
loss and need, that there was 
no
 legal liability, and
they'd done so because they were recognising the
distress caused to haemophiliacs.

--Result #141--

I first asked for 
compensation 
on a parity with Eire in
1996
, 
which was when we learnt of what Ireland had
granted their haemophiliacs
, 
and that was when I first
wrote to the Haemophilia Society.  They looked at it and
then they said, "
No,
 we'll go for a hardship fund."

--Result #142--

Well, I think Pete would have had some peace of mind
.
I
 
mean
, 
Pete was an incredibly forgiving man.  Even at
the very end he was forgiving.  And I think if somebody
had said, "Look, you know, we made some terrible
mistakes and we really are genuinely sorry and we're
going to give you some compensation
", 
it would have
meant we would have had some comfort and we could have
relaxed and enjoyed our time together, you know, what
was left of it.
Then after Pete died, I mean
, 
I was unable to move
 
191
on because I'd given a commitment and I wanted to get
truth and justice, and -- I mean
,
 
for example
, I was
headhunted to do a PhD.  I was offered an opportunity,
a funded place, and it was part-time, and I really,
really wanted to do it.  I was going to do it, and 
then
I had to look 
at
 it seriously and I thought
, "
How can
I do a PhD when I'm working night and day on this?
"
I mean, 
I literally worked through the day.  My average
sleep is 
two
 hours a night, three if I'm lucky, and this
has gone on for years
, 
you know, which is probably why
I'm quite a mess, you know, sort of physically and
mentally, sort of keeping this going.
But I would have probably done a PhD
.  
You know, my
health hopefully
, you know, 
would have at that point
there might have been some chance of things improving
and then I 
could 
have gone back to work.  After some
years I might have even met somebody and been able to go
into another relationship, but I mean I would say, you
know, they'd have to be a special person who would, you
know, sort of take me on with all this crap.  You know.
So 
yeah
.  So it feels as if a big part of my adult
life has, you know, is gone.  The only way I've been
able to keep sane, in a way, is one of the other things
I do is use my life experience to campaign in other
areas.  And because people around the world, 
you know,
 
192
they know that I've suffered as 
well
, and that opens
doors, and they can see I'm not just somebody who is,
you know, distanced from loss and suffering.  I've been
there.  So I'm -- in a way, at least I can do something,
because at least I can use some of that experience
elsewhere
, 
I know
, 
and that's been accepted more
 -- 
more
than 
here, really.  I mean, I've mentioned this before,
it's 
no
 secret, but I've been, you know, involved in
prisoner exchange with regard to Afghanistan
,
an
 
American sold
i
er, which has worked out very
successful
ly
, 
he's
 free, and the other five people he
was exchanged for are now running a country in
Afghanistan.  And it's a very different picture from
what's often painted in the newspapers.
So I 
feel
 as if, you know, there's a door there,
I can talk to people, and I can talk about, you know,
women in Afghanistan, I can talk about health in
Afghanistan, and I want to try to do more there.  I want
to use my experience.  If I give you an example, can you
imagine what it's like to be a haemophiliac in
Afghanistan, where the health and infrastructure is
falling apart, and the assets currently frozen in
Afghanistan, so ordinary people are suffering, and
I just want ordinary people to be able to have a better
life.  Not live in poverty.  People with disabilities to
 

8 July 2022
          

  193
be taken care of.  And I believe and I do believe that
that's possible, and I know what's going on behind 
the
scenes, and, you know, I want to say to the Government:
just listen.  Give people a chance.  Things are going to
improve there but don't
 
punish the population.
Another thing I want to say very strongly is in
some
 
countries they still don't get treatment for
haemophilia.  I mean, here people are infected through
the treatment
.  
In other countries, you know, they don't
have access.  Still don't have access to treatment.
In
 
places like Israel there's Apartheid medical
treatment
, 
and I'm in touch with haemophiliacs there,
and I just want to say to them, haven't forgotten you.
You know, 
I spoke to one person couple of weeks ago, and
I will do everything I can to fight for you to have
proper treatment.
So, you know, I use my experience in ways like that.

--Result #143--

Then you have done 
a
 
"
Summary of Recommendations
", 
which
I do
n't
 think we need to go to.
Then 
it
's
 this part
, "
Detailed Recommendations and
Initial Response" I wanted to ask you about
.
You make the point that:
"Several of these recommendations are based on
measures that have been implemented in the Republic of
 

13 July 2022
          
          

  61
Ireland (notably, establishment of 
a
 statutory
haemophilia committee, establishing 
an
 insurance scheme
for affected patients, and 
a
 generous compensation
scheme, which we understand averages around
£750,000/patient affected)."
Then you say this:
"The situation in the UK is different to that in
Ireland, where it was acknowledged that action to reduce
the risk could have been taken earlier.  The Irish Blood
Service issued 
an
 apology acknowledging 
'
failures
'
 in
the past and their payment 
regime
 reflects this
admission of mistakes."
Now, 
just looking at that
, 
would you accept that
while
, 
of course
, 
there hadn't been any judicial --
there hadn't been 
inquiries, 
there 
hadn't been any
find
ings
 of fault in the respect of any government
decision-making, we know that 
a
 High Court judge in the
hepatitis C litigation, the A
 and 
Others litigation had
found that screening could and should have been
introduced earlier
, 
and Lord Archer, as you set out in
this annex, had found that early achievement of
UK
 
self-sufficiency in blood products would have
significantly reduced the scale of transmission of
infection to patients
.
Just -- and 
bearing in 
mind
 that those are the only
 
62
two instances in which government decision-making had
been held up to public scrutiny, bearing that in 
mind
,
could it really be said at this stage that the situation
in the UK was different to that in Ireland?

--Result #144--

I'm going to 
come on again to 
ask you 
a
 few more
questions about the Departmental position about that.
We can leave this document now and just for
completeness -- we don't need to turn to it -- but there
is 
a
 record of the meeting between the ministers and
Lord Archer
, and for the transcript that's 
DHSC5277959
.
Can we turn 
now 
to this document DHSC
5
564474.
Now, 
if we turn over to page 2
, 
please
, 
we can see
that this is an email from Penelope Irving
,
 
so 
she is in
the office of the Secretary of State, dated
13 March 2009, to 
a
 number of people
, 
including
yourself
.
It is addressed to "All
", and 
it is following up
from the meeting with Lord Archer.  It sets out what was
discussed there.
If we go about halfway down the page
 
there
, 
we can
see
:
 
63
"[
Secretary of State
]
 would need to be convinced
that current financial arrangements were insufficient
before he considered any adjustments to the compensation
system.
  Lord Archer explained that many patients
suffered financial hardship but MS(PH) said it was
important to distinguish what financial pressures were
a
 consequence of the infection, as opposed to 
being
 the
consequence of the illness which had caused the patients
to need transfusion in the first place ie haemophilia."
That
 
is
 
a
 summary 
there 
of what was said in relation
to that.  It is over the page that I 
just 
want to get
your evidence about.
At the end of the summary we have then:
"In terms of next steps 
[
Secretary of State
]
 and
MS(PH) would like to receive advice on the following
points:
"
- 
they would like to look at the eligibility
criteria for those who receive money under the different
schemes including options to rationalise the schemes
(which should incorporate the options already outlined
on how and if to adjust compensation).
"
And then:
"
- 
what are the options for the department regarding
insurance provision
 ..."
And 
look
ing
 at funding for The Haemophilia Society
.
 
64
I 
just 
want to understand the process.  This is what
we see sometimes
, 
is it
, we 
see sometimes
 
referral to
 --
a
 submission 
being
 
commissioned
.  
This is -- is 
this
a
 commissioning
 -- 

--Result #145--

So what we don't have in here is 
a
 request to look at
what Lord Archer
 was recommending
 -- one of the
recommendations Lord Archer made
, 
which was for
compensation to be awarded on 
a
 par with
 -- 
at least 
on
a par with 
Ireland
.

--Result #146--

So I'm going to move on now to events post this
announcement and I'm going to pick it up on 2 June 2009
,
so 
a
 couple of weeks after the announcement that we just
looked at
.
DHSC0041219_077
, and it's
 in fact page 2 where the
document I want to look at starts.
We can see this is from you to the Minister of State
for Public Health
, 
again still at this stage
Dawn Primarolo
, and 
it sets out the next steps after the
government response to Lord Archer
, 
and it sets out some
information about the reaction.  So you say this:
"Reaction to the Government package announced in
response to Lord Archer's report has been limited
, 
but
negative."
 
84
Then it sets out the main area of criticisms there
about the level of payments that have been announced.
Then at paragraph 2
: 
"
You have asked us for more detailed information as
to why the situation here is different from Ireland
,
together with possible options for handling the
criticism around the Skipton Fund.
"
Then you go on to set out why Ireland is different.
You say this
: 
"
The Government here has never accepted any
liability.  We believe that people were offered the best
treatment available at the time and that as soon as
blood screening tests were available they were
implemented.
"
I'm not going to ask you about that again.  I have
already asked you about that.
Then you say
:
"There were
 attempts to bring litigation against the
Government 
..."
And set out what happened in relation to that
.  
Then you say:
"Payments 
from
 all these funds are ex gratia
goodwill payments only."
Then you make some comments about the level of
payments at the Macfarlane and Eileen Trust.  So that's
 

13 July 2022
          
          

  85
the government position in England.
Then if we go over the page you say this:
"In Ireland also
, 
the State did not explicitly admit
liability.  However, contrary to the position in the UK
,
the Irish Blood Transfusion Service 
(IBTS) 
was found
,
 by
a
 judicial inquiry
,
 to have been responsible on two
occasions
 (
1977 and again in 1991
) 
for 
failures
 which
resulted in 
the
 large
-
scale contamination 
with
hepatitis C 
of a blood product 
used to treat pregnant
women.  This 
finding resulted from the IBTS's 
failure 
on
both occasions to follow its own guidelines that blood
from previously
-
transfused individuals should not be
used for the preparation of 
blood 
products because of
the increased risk of infection.
"The report of this Finlay Inquiry concluded that
'
wrongful acts were committed
'
.  The Irish Government
therefore
 [
and I stress the word 
'
therefore
'] 
set up
a
 hepatitis C compensation scheme in 1997 for the
infected women following this conclusion
, 
and because of
the threat of litigation (which the Irish Government
believed it would lose)."
Then you say:
"The compensation scheme was later extended to all
people infected with hepatitis C through blood products
and blood transfusion, as some infected women had
 
86
donated blood and 
thereby
 infected others."
Then you refer to 
an
 
answer
 given by Lord
 
Warner
.
So I think you have already said that this was
a
 view that was commonly held in the Department
.

--Result #147--
 Well, we're a team, yes -- so yes, I mean, greatly 
regrettable that the Department doesn't -- I'm not 
saying -- don't get me wrong.  I'm just explaining 
what the factual situation is.  I'm not trying to  
210 escape saying, "It wasn't me, guv".  I don't think the 
Department did anything wrong.  I've never heard 
anybody suggest anything that in the real world 
a minister or a civil servant might have done that 
would have prevented it.  I've already said, had we
taken the step we now know would have saved lives, 
we'd have been treated with outrage by the Haemophi lia 
Society and most haemophiliacs by denying them thei r 
Factor VIII.  There just wasn't the evidence to 
suggest that. 
I don't think the Department did anything wrong, 
I don't think there was anything the Department cou ld 
have done that it didn't do.  It's the current way of 
the life now.  It's part of the current political 
scene, that somebody has got to be summonsed, to us e 
the old saying.  Someone has got to be found to be 
blamed for this, and it's all the fault of the 
Government, really.  Or sometimes it's all the faul t 
of the Tory party; it depends who is in power at th e 
time.  I don't think we did anything really wrong.  We 
all now, with the benefit of hindsight, know what 
happened.  
I hope the ministers in the present Government 
know they're going to be put through all this on 
Covid.  There will be a public Inquiry, it'll take  
211 five years, spend tens of millions of pounds, and t he 
media will be urging it on to get Boris Johnson hun g 
from the yard arm, and to give compensation to 
everybody who ever had Covid. 
That's the way of the world.  In the real world, 
the calmness of this Inquiry, that was my involveme nt. 
If anybody failed to do anything, yes, I was a memb er 
of the Department of Health, I was part of the team .
The Secretary of State when you come on to me being  my 
Secretary of State, overall responsibility, in the end 
the buck stops with you, you're not only the head o f 
everything, you're the last resort, you are the per son 
overall responsible.  And in a big department like the 
Department of Health, one of it -- some of your 
juniors, some of your officials are going to make 
a mistake.  They're going to make a pig's ear of 
something, you probably won't have a clue what it w as 
until you're told when you walk into the office one
morning and you have to start trying to sort it out
and you're responsible -- you can't get away from t he 
fact that you're the last resort, Secretary of Stat e 
is overall responsibility. 
As Minister of State, as a middle-ranking 
minister, I don't seek to escape any responsibility , 
and if something went wrong, then I, you know -- I' m  
212 implicated.  I share the blame.  But my actual 
personal role is the one that's described, and 
I never -- I wasn't the one holding policy discussi ons 
and taking decisions about whether we import or not . 
I was aware this discussion was going on, that's al l. 

--Result #148--

Yes
, 
I think
 -- yes, 
in broad terms.  
I mean, 
Liam
,
rightly I think
, 
was concerned about the impact of
infectious disease and the fact that there 
really 
wasn't
a
 holistic strategy that the Department had around those
issues
, 
which is why he published this
, 
by the way with
my encouragement. 
 
It was 
an
 important and quite seminal
statement about what needed to be done.
 
38
The hepatitis C strategy I think flowed from that
but it also flowed from decisions that ministers had
made
.  
And
, 
you know
, 
as I have been going through the
papers, again, 
a
 lot of this, in fact most of it, to be
honest with you
, 
was 
being
 dealt with by
junior
 
ministers, Phil and Yvette and so on and so
forth
, 
rather than by me
, 
but as I have gone through the
papers it became obvious that there were 
a
 series of
quite major issues that were impacting people with
hepatitis C that needed to be dealt with in the round
,
but
 of course could be picked off one by one.  
You know,
this was 
a
 serious illness
, 
which caused huge amounts of
suffering and trauma for those affected
.  
There were
obviously the issues of compensation and so on
, 
but
there were also issues of treatment
.  
And what has been in 
particular
 for me very
 --
I suppose 
a
 matter of pride for me as I have gone
through the papers, I have learned about the way that my
ministers -- I think that every one of them were
determined to try to find ways to improve services for
people with hepatitis C
., 
whether that was John Hutton
or
 
Phil
 Hunt or
 
Yvette Cooper or Hazel Blears
, 
and that
resulted in the hepatitis C strategy.
So it was informed
, 
if you like
, 
from the top
down, from Liam's Getting Ahead of the Curve infectious
 
39
disease strategy
, 
and
 
it was informed from the bottom up
by ministers pushing some of these issues
.

--Result #149--

  
Mr Milburn
, 
you observe in your statement
that
, 
prior to your taking over the role of Secretary of
State for Health, 
a
 decision not to provide financial
support for haemophiliacs affected by HCV had been taken
by your predecessor
, Frank 
Dobson
.
Just to set the scene, 
I just want to look at
 
52
that.  It is DHSC
0016534
.  It is 
a
 letter dated
28 July 1998 to Chris Hodgson
, 
then the Chair of The
Haemophilia Society
, 
and I think we need only look at
the first three paragraphs.  It says:
"As you know we have been giving lengthy and
careful consideration to the Haemophilia Society's
proposal that haemophiliacs who have been 
infected 
with
hepatitis C through NHS treatment should receive special
payments
.
"The Government has proceeded on the basis that
compensation or other financial help to 
particular
patients or groups of patients is only paid out where
the NHS or individuals working in it have been at fault.
The needs of people whose condition results from
inadvertent harm is met from benefits available to the
population in general.  I am sorry to have to tell you
that after considering all aspects of this matter we
have decided that we should not make 
an
 exception to the
general rule in the case of haemophiliacs infected with
hepatitis C.
"Your Society takes the view that haemophiliacs
infected with hepatitis C are 
a
 special case because the
infection comes on top of 
a
 pre-existing serious long
term medical condition.  However
 
the same considerations
apply to other individual patients and groups of
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  53
patients, whether inadvertently infected with another
illness or harmed as a result of another medical or
surgical procedure who can only obtain compensation if
there had been negligence."
Then the letter goes on to 
deal with seeking to
distinguish the position in relation to HIV and 
then,
over the page
, 
we can see it is 
a
 letter from
Frank Dobson
.
So, is it right to understand 
that 
the decision
and the policy of the Department that you essentially

It may be then 
that
 
is
 
an
 issue we will need to pick up
with others.  Can we then
, 
in terms of your own time in
office
, 
pick up the picture 
in 
November 1999 
at
SCGV0000170_212.  This
 
is 
a
 letter from Graham Ross
a
 solicitor who had been involved both with the HIV
Haemophilia 
Litigation 
and 
now representing a number
in
fected by hepatitis C.  He wrote on 4 November 1999 to
you.  First paragraph wishes you well
, 
says this:
 
55
"I appreciate there will be 
a
 considerable number
of issues with which you will need to be acquainted
, 
but
I wonder if I may raise 
a
 
particular
 one of pressing
concern
.
"I act for 
a
 number of haemophiliacs who are
presently suing your Department as a result of their
infection with Hepatitis C virus through contaminated
blood products.  I enclose 
a
 copy of 
a
 letter I sent to
your predecessor with the enclosed copy letter to
Stephen Dorrell.  You will of course be well aware of
the campaign in relation to this matter.  There has been
an
 Early Day Motion (which you have signed and copy of
which I attach) calling upon the then Conservative
Government to provide compensation.  In point of fact
there are many present members of the Cabinet who also
strongly believe that Government should set up
a
 compensation scheme for those infected, including the
motion's co-sponsor, Angela Eagle MP
.
"I fully appreciate that even though, as
a
 back
 
bench MP, one sees the strength of the 
moral
argument
, 
that, on entering the Cabinet and, in your
case, taking charge of the relevant Department of State,
that you may then become aware of priorities and issues
that perhaps could lead you to take 
a
 different view.
However
, 
I would imagine 
that the force of the moral
 
56
argument in this political case is so strong that there
would be considerable sympathy and support still
remaining with all those in Cabinet who supported the
Early Day Motion, notwithstanding the wider perspective
that you might now have from your 
present position in
Government."
If we then go over the page
, 
Mr Ross says this:
"Two significant events have happened since my
letter to Frank Dobson MP."
I'm not going to read out the rest of that
paragraph but he refers there to evidence given in
American proceedings about the possibility of heat
treatment of Factor VIII products 
being
 introduced
significantly earlier than it was.
If we just pick it up towards the end of that long
paragraph
, 
he says in the last three lines:
"I make it clear that 
this 
approach to yourself is
not on the basis of legal liability but, given that your
predecessors have frequently put up 
a
 claim that there
is no fault as 
a
 reason to not set up 
a
 compensation
scheme, it is relevant to the issue in 
a
 wider context.
"The second development is in the recent evidence
to the effect that Scottish haemophiliacs did not
receive heat 
treated
 product until some time after it
was available in England and Wales.
"
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  57
It then says this:
"
I 
would 
very much welcome hearing from you as
early as possible with feelings on this matter.  I do
appreciate that there will be somewhere within your
office 
a
 stock letter developed by your Department's
officials that has been produced in varying forms over
the years to anyone seeking to urge the Department to
set up 
a
 compensation scheme.  I have 
an
 extensive
collection.  It 
would 
be not onl
y un
helpful but
personally insulting to me to receive yet another
variation of the stock negative response.  Basically
what 
I am
 asking is that
, 
as you personally signed the
[Early Day Motion], 
that you consider taking true
'
personal ownership
'
 of this issue 
rather than, as has
been the practice of your predecessors from both sides
of the House, 
leaving it to be run by the Department
itself.  By that comment
 
I do not mean to offend the
civil servants who 
assist
 and advise you but merely
seeking to make the point that surely the strength of
the 
moral
 issue involved screams out for 
a
 truly
personal response.  Anything less
, 
and given the signing
of the EDM by yourself and colleagues in Cabinet
, 
would
be deeply offensive to my clients."
That
 
is
 
a
 letter addressed to you and asking
specifically for 
a
 response from you as Secretary of
 
58
State
, 
in part because you had previously in opposition
signed 
an
 Early Day Motion on this very issue.
As I understand it from your statement, you don't
think you ever saw this letter?

--Result #151--

Then you were also right that there was 
a
 response and
it is 
a
 response from Lord Hunt.  We will just briefly
look at it.  It is DHSC0006462_085.  I'm not going to
read the letter aloud.  We can see paragraph 3 refers to
sympathy and the Government having listened soberly to
the arguments for compensation.
Then the bottom of the page, the last paragraph
,
refers to essentially the ongoing policy position
: 
"... 
compensation 
or 
other financial help is only
given when the NHS 
or 
individuals working in it have
been at fault
."  
And then
, 
if we go over the page, Lord Hunt
addresses in the first three paragraphs the issues that
Mr Ross had flagged up and 
I think, 
bearing in 
mind
 your
own lack of involvement in this letter
, 
the adequacy or
otherwise of that response is 
probably 
something that
 
62
would need to be explored with others.
Can I ask you to look at the submission that went
to Lord Hunt about this.  It is DHSC0006462_091.  So
this is dated 22 November 1999.  It is from
Mike McGovern and it is to Lord Hunt.  If we 
look
 at the
name
s
 of copy recipients, I don't think that includes
anyone in your private office
?

--Result #152--

We can certainly check that, 
but 
in any event it is
copied to 
a
 wide number of people within the Department.
I just wanted to look at paragraphs 2 and 3.  It is
really paragraph 2
, 
but I will read 2 and 3.
So:
"
He 
..."
That's Mr Ross
.  
This is the description from
Dr 
Mike
 McGovern within the Department:
 
63
"He makes 
a
 strident case for compensation to 
[be]
paid 
because of the Department's significant level of
culpability 
in this
 shameful history of the UK's blood
industry and plaintive plea for 
a
 personal reply from
the Secretary of State so as not 
to 
add to his
'
extensive collection
'
 of stock letters.
"
3.  
I attach 
a
 draft that expresses sympathy for
the plight of this unfortunate group 
of patients,
repeats the Government's policy not to provide
compensation, and rejects a claim of negligence on the
part of the NHS.  The draft does not pick up his
tentative request for a meeting to discuss the issues.
It has been cleared in confidence with relevant
divisions ..."
And 
a
 number of those are then listed.  
Now, 
it
might be said the reference 
to 
the 
"
strident case
"
 and
the 
"
plaintiff plea
"
 may be said to display 
a
 degree of
impatience with the approach, 
or 
dismissive in some
respect?  Is that the ordinary way in which you would
expect departmental officials to characterise these kind
of issues 
being
 raised?

--Result #153--
  It is almost certain that the Court will
arrive at an earlier date than September 1991;
"
(v) 
the UK was, by some way, the last of the
major developed countries to introduce universal
screening for HCV in blood.  The US licensed the new
test and introduced screening in May 1990, and most
European countries began screening the same year.
Although there were good reasons for the delay in the
UK
 -- 
discussions on the cost/benefits of the new test,
followed by trials
 -- 
legal advice is that 
these
 are
unlikely to stand up to serious scrutiny in court."
Paragraph (vi) sets out 
some more detail about 
the
decision making of the Department's 
Advisory Committee
on 
Virological 
Safety of Blood.
 
70
Paragraph (vii) 
refers to 
trials taking place in
five regional blood transfusion centres.
"
These centres continued to use the test until it
was introduced across all 14
 
regions in September 1991.
This led to 
a
 situation where between 
a
 third and 
a
 half
of English blood 
donations were being screened for HCV
from May 1991 onwards, whilst the rest were not
.
"
If we just continue:
"Likely Outcome of the Court Case: Advice from
Counsel."
I'm not going to read (i) of paragraph 6.  That
refers to 
an
 issue in 
particular
 to 
the 
issues 
that were
having to be determined by Mr Justice Burton.
(ii) is headed "surrogate testing
".  
I 
just 
want
to read that because it leads in
 
to 
a
 question I'm going
to ask you shortly:
"
... 
this is 
a
 test for general liver problems
rather than one which specifically 
screens out HCV.  The
claimants will argue that surrogate testing would have
substantially reduced the risk of HCV infection and
should therefore have been introduced before the
screening test became available.  However, the
reliability of this form of testing was at all times
controversial.  It was introduced in some countries
(eg
 
Germany) with uncertain results but was eschewed by
 
71
the UK and others.  Surrogate testing would have led to
a
 large number of false positives, seriously depleting
the blood supply, and would not have made blood risk
free: the risk would simply have been less.  Counsel
therefore doubts that a Court would rule that blood not
subject to surrogate testing fell below the level of
safety that person generally were entitled to 
expect."
Then, 
paragraph 7:
"If these arguments fail, the Court will need to
decide when it would have been reasonable for the UK to
introduce screening.  Counsel sees this as serious area
of vulnerability for the reasons outlined ... above 
...
in Counsel's opinion, those claimants infected after
May 1991 are 
'
very likely to succeed
'
 
and there is
'serious vulnerability' back to January 1991.  However,
it is possible that the Court may take an earlier date,
and Counsel has suggested that the introduction of
screening by the US in May 1990 might possible 
be used
as 
a
 benchmark."
Then we see
, 
under the heading "Proposal for
an
 
Out of Court
 Settlement
", 
Lord Hunt says:
"
... 
I have been convinced by the arguments put
forward by the NHS Litigation Authority
, 
and the lawyers
acting for them
, 
that we should allow the NBA to settle
this case out of court."
 
72
Then 
we see three reasons given
.  Likelihood of
losing, essentially, is the 
first 
bullet point, and
a precedent being set, the next 
is negative publicity
,
and the third is legal costs.
Then this in 
9 and 10:
"
9.  
My concern, however, has been around the
terms of such 
a
 settlement.  I want to ensure that there
is 
a
 clear and defend
able
 distinct
ion 
between settlement
of this litigation and our continued refusal to
compensate haemophiliacs infected with HCV through blood
products on the basis of non
 
negligent harm."
"
10.  
The main plank of our argument for refusing
payment to haemophiliacs has been that heat treatment to
eliminate HCV from blood products was introduced as soon
as the technology was available.  This is not true for
the introduction of the screening test for HCV, and
a
 financial settlement can be justified on that basis.
However, we would start to run into difficulties if we
include in the settlement those claimants infected
before the screening test became commercially
available."
Then if we go over the page
, 
I 
don't
 think I need
to go through the detail of what follows
, 
there is then
a
 proposal as to how the case could be settled so as to
avoid the precedent setting in relation to, amongst
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  73
others, haemophiliacs.
If we then go to page 6
., 
paragraph 20
, 
you are
asked:
"Are you content with my proposal that
:
"(i) 
a
 settlement is offered on the following
basis
 ..."
And there is 
an
 offer of paying compensation to
claimants infected after May 1990 and 
a
 
fallback of
compensation paid to claimants infected after
January 
1990."
The first question before I ask you about some of
the points of detail is this.  Why do you think this was
coming to you as Secretary of State
?  
Because the actual
sums involved in either the initial offer
 or 
the
fallback offer are comparatively small
?

--Result #154--

So I think the first and obvious thing that the court
judgment really did was that -- this is my understanding
and
, 
by the
 
way
, 
I'm not 
a
 lawyer
, 
so you will correct
me if you think I'm wrong
 -- 
is that it established
a
 different test because the test was taking place under
the Consumer Protection Act
, 
and the test was one of
strict liability
, 
which was 
a
 different test from the
test
s
 that were 
being
 applied when fault claims were
being
 made
, 
as 
indeed
 they were around the pre-1985
situation
, 
and the way that people were infected both
with HIV and hepatitis C.
 
76
So, there was 
a
 different -- there were different
rules of the game that had been established for some
groups of patients
.
Of course
, 
these were patients that had been
infected with hepatitis C but it didn't necessarily
apply to people with haemophilia.
So there were 
a
 number of, I think, difficult
consequences
, 
which I think had long
-
lasting
, actually,
implications for subsequent policy discussions and
decisions.  The first was that
 
so
me 
people had decided
to litigation but 
a
 far larger number
 -- or
 another way
of putting it
, 
some people had decided not to litigate.
So then there was 
an
 issue about, well, is that
really fair?  So John Hutton, the Minister of State, was
dealing with this issue at the time
, 
and in one of the
submissions he poses the question to Charles Lister
,
"
Shouldn't we do something about the fact that some
people are going to benefit from 
being
 part of the
litigant group here whilst others who decided
, 
for
whatever reason
, 
not to be part of the litigant group
are not going to be able to now litigate because they
are timed out?
"
I think John's view was that that was unfair.  The
advice came back that there was essentially nothing that
could be done.  So that was
, 
if you like
, 
a
 small but
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  77
important consequence
.
The second consequence really was much broader
than that.  Again, this is my understanding
, 
and
I repeat I'm not 
a
 lawyer.  This established 
a
 strict
liability test but it wasn't 
being
 applied
retrospectively because the legislation wasn't set up to
do that.  It was passed in 
'
87, enacted I think
, 
i
n
March 
'
88
, 
but it
, therefore, couldn't
 apply to people
who had the concerns that they had about the pre-1985
situation.  So that created 
an
 issue
.  
And the third thing that it really did -- my
understanding now -- is that
, 
because the judgment was
made on the basis of strict liability, it really didn't
consider matters of fault.  So you could argue
, 
in
layman's terms
, 
that effectively it was 
a
 
no
-
fault
compensation judgment.  The problem for the Department
is that the policy wasn't no
-
fault compensation.  And it
is very telling
, 
I think
, 
that John Hutton made the
correct judgment
, 
in my view
, 
retrospectively
, 
that
, 
as
a
 consequence of this judgment, that this 
particular
judgment should be referred to the 
Chief Medical
Officer
's review of clinical negligence and his
consideration of no
-
fault compensation.
So this was 
a
 judgment that was quite
 -- 
in
retrospect
, 
looking at it again
 -- 
quite 
a
 significant
 
78
one
, 
I think
.  
And then it prompted
, 
as you know from
the papers, it then prompted 
a
 big question about
 "
Well
,
shouldn't 
we be doing more for people with haemophilia
and people who had been infected pre-1985
".  
Then you
had the 
Briony Enser 
submission to Yvette Cooper
,
setting out 
a
 range of options
, 
and so on and so forth
.
So 
I think
, 
in retrospect
, 
it was 
a
 significant
moment.  Did I understand that at the time?  No
I didn't
, 
to be candid
.

--Result #155--

Yes.  I think the response
, 
I think
, 
that we received
was that this was 
a
 judgment that took place, however,
on different criteria, according to 
a
 different set of
tests because 
it 
took place under this 
particular
 Act
around strict liability, strict product liability
, 
and
obviously
 
the judgment was
 that there -- 
in those terms
,
that there was fault
.
 
80
But that isn't how the Department or the NHS dealt
with compensation claims.  It wasn't under this
particular
 act.  So I think there is 
a
 recognition in
,
I think
, 
subsequent submissions that this did cause
a
 challenge to that
, 
and then there was 
a
 question of
how can we reconcile all these things and what more
should we be doing
, 
and so on and so forth.
So, I think it did -- it probably did beg some
questions
, 
yes.

--Result #156--

Yes
, 
I think 
that
 
is
 right and I think there is
a
 slightly more general point here but 
an
 important one.
I think this judgment played absolutely into this.
I think what decision makers, whether they were
ministers or civil servants
 -- 
but maybe specifically
ministers
 -- 
were trying to do was reconcile really
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  81
three things on this issue of compensation.
The first was the obvious empathy that people,
ministers, me included
, 
obviously felt about the issue.
As I said earlier
, 
this was 
a
 catastrophe and 
indeed
 one
only had to listen
, 
as I did
, 
to some of the evidence
that people have given 
here
 
to
 understand the extent of
the suffering and trauma that has been inflicted on
people
.
So I think there was if you like -- I think every
minister who dealt with this issue was hugely
empathetic.  You hear words about sympathy
, 
and 
so on
and 
so forth
, 
but I think that was real
, 
first of all.
I think then what ministers were trying to do was
reconcile that level of empathy with two further things,
the legality of the situation and the fact that
ministers
, 
and I guess civil servants
, 
had
a
 responsibility to try to uphold the way that the rules
around how compensation was dealt with in the NHS
, 
which
was on the basis
, 
in the end
, about 
whether there had
been fault, without slipping inexorably to
wards 
no-fault
compensation.  There was 
a
 real concern that that could
happen
, 
with consequences for the NHS that could have
been quite significant
.  
And
, 
indeed
, 
in Liam Donaldson's report
, 
as you
know
, 
in making amends where he considered these issues
,
 
82
I think he did so in quite 
a
 balanced way and 
that 
he
looked at the arguments for and 
the 
arguments against
no-fault compensation, but in the end came down against
in part
 -- 
not exclusively but in part
 -- 
because of the
potential costs to the National Health Service
, 
and he
talked about 
a
 figure of £4 billion
, 
potentially as
a
 consequence of no-fault compensation.
So there were concerns about the legality and the
final concern
, 
in all of these issues around
compensation
, 
was 
a
 concern about policy.  So, what
would be the consequences of agreeing to compensation
for this -- not just this group of patients but for
others?  What would be the consequences for the NHS as
a whole?
Of course
, 
uppermost in all 
of 
our minds
, 
as you
are making these decisions and having to weigh up and
balance this three sided triangle
, 
if you like, of
course the interest of NHS patients as a whole were
uppermost in every
one
's minds
.  
And
 
I think this
judgment came and sat starkly in the middle of that
triangle and
, 
obviously
, 
in the end
, 
you know
, 
these are
inevitably matters of judgment and the very fact that my
successor John Reid could take 
a
 different decision from
me
 -- 
and John's 
a
 very good friend of mine, came to
a
 very different position, it is not something
 
83
I discussed with him
 -- 
tells you that these were quite
finely balanced issues that I think they were all the
way through.

--Result #157--

  
If we could then move to October
 
2000.
DHSC0006245_007.  This is the meeting held in relation
to the BSE Inquiry report.  11 October 2000
, "

attendance.  I don't need
to read out all the names 
but 
it includes you.  The

it includes representatives from your private office.
Chris Kelly
, 
I think you have already indicated
, 
is the
permanent secretary by this time.  
So 
A
 range of people
participating
.
Then, there is 
a
 heading "Care for people with
vCJD
", 
which I don't propose to read through.  If we go
towards the bottom of the page
, 
we have got the heading
 
88
"financial support/compensation issues
":
"
A
 meeting on compensation issues, chaired by the
Lord Chancellor (in view of the settling of legal
precedents and the possible need for mediation) has been
proposed for next weekend:
"Counsel 
(
JF
)
 
[
that's Justin Fenwick 
who was
representing the Department in relation to vCJD claims
]
suggested that if compensation were offered for this
kind of problem it would be very difficult to avoid
compensation for future 
'
disasters
'
.  There would also
then always be louder calls for 
an
 Inquiry on each
occasion, if this was seen to improve the compensation
outcome.  With haemophiliacs infected with HIV the
approach had been to invite them to name 
a
 sensible
figure, so that there was no criticism that the
government were 
being
 mean.  Another advantage of
mediation was that the claimants were more likely to
keep the issues confidential.  The difference between
the current case and the haemophiliacs was that the
litigation risk with the current plaintiffs was low.  In
addition the haemophiliacs were 
a
 small, defined number
([about] 1,850) and compensation was justified on the
grounds of 
their 
'
double jeopardy
'
 in that they were
already significantly disadvantaged by their condition."
Just before we look at a couple of other
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  89
interventions or contributions
, 
I should say
, 
to the
meeting.  The context here was the heading "BSE Inquiry
report briefing meeting
".  
There had been the BSE
Inquiry, this was -- I haven't checked the date upon
which the BSE Inquiry report was published.  But this is
in that context
 --

--Result #158--

Then paragraph 6 refers there to you:
"SofS asked whether providing compensation in this
case would impact on the current hepatitis C
litigation."
That
, 
I think
, 
again
, 
is
 a 
reference to the
litigation we were discussing 
a
 few moments ago:
"JF 
[Justin Fenwick] 
indicated that there was
 
90
still arguments about 
'
duty of care
'
 to be resolved
, 
and
the NBA might not lose the case.  The 
critical
difference was that negligence or causation were still
to be determined in the 
HCV case."
The handwriting
, 
is that your handwriting
?

--Result #159--

You've got the first word, I couldn't get it:
"... 
of 
a
 case for compensation against HMG 
being
won."
I think the reason -- this is quite unusual -- in
fact
, 
from memory
, 
I think it is the only time that it
happened where someone from my private office, in this
case Stephen Waring
, 
came to me with the note and
I think if you go to the top of this --

--Result #160--

"... 
which went as far as possible, 
without prejudicing
the financial outcome.  
A
 paper was needed on this."
So 
that
, I think, is
 the discussion on
compensation recorded here.  Perhaps 
just 
before we
leave this document and
,
 
indeed
,
 break for lunch
, 
there
is then 
a
 heading "Medicine
s
"
?

Mr Milburn we looked before lunch at that
meeting in October 2000.  If we could then pick matters
up in December 2000.  DHSC0004451_074.
This is 
a
 letter from you to the then Chief
Secretary to the 
Treasury
, 
Andrew Smith MP.  It refers
to 
a
 meeting you had held that day to discuss funding
issues in relation to vCJD.  We can see from the second
paragraph you agreed to find money, £25 million, from
the Department of Health's budget to fund 
the
 
revenue
costs of introducing single use instruments for
tonsillectomies but reserved the right to come back if
single
-
use instruments were going to be extended on vCJD
avoidance grounds and 
to 
other procedures
.
If we go to the last paragraph
, 
we can see you say
 
103
there that
: 
"... 
you
 [
so that's the Chief Secretary
] 
agreed
that the costs of the compensation scheme we are trying
to set up (
ie 
to deal with up to 250 cases) should be
borne from the reserve."
Do you have any recollection now of how easy or
difficult it had been to get agreement from the Treasury
to provid
ing
 funding from the reserve for the vCJD
compensation scheme
?

--Result #162--

Still in late 2000 but a little earlier than your
meeting with the chief secretary, there was 
an
 exchange
of correspondence between yourself and Baroness Jay.
 
104
I just wanted to ask you something from arising out of
those letters, 
so 
CABO0000123_006.  This is Baroness Jay
writing to you on 
23 October 
2000 and it refers 
in 
the
text of the letter to her raising 
a
 question
: 
"... 
at our meeting on Thursday
 
19 October of the
possible anomalies involved in creating 
a
 specific
ex gratia grant system for people suffering from vCJD
and their families.  I was particularly concerned about
those with Hepatitis C."
Then she refers to 
an
 advert in the Irish press
and the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal
, 
which was
a
 tribunal established in the Republic of Ireland
, 
and
says:
"
... 
I thought you 
should know about the
publication of these advertisements at a time which
might create unwelcome comparative publicity about our
scheme."
She 
then refers to 
copying the letter to members
of the 
Ministerial Meeting on vCJD.
We saw Baroness Jay 
obviously 
referred to earlier
in the context of it being suggested that, 
along with
officials
, she'd 
they talked Frank Dobson out of
compensation 
or 
financial support for haemophiliacs with
hepatitis C 
at
 
a
 point in time when I think she was in
the Department of Health
?

--Result #163--

In any event, if we turn to your reply, 
which is
CABO000
0123_013, 
you wrote on 22 November 2000
, 
back to
Baroness Jay.  The second paragraph you say this:
"As you anticipated, comparisons have been made
between the decision to make ex gratia
-
gratia payments
to people with vCJD and our continued refusal to
compensate people with haemophilia infected with
hepatitis C through blood products."
You give 
an
 example of 
an
 adjournment debate on
9 November:
"However
, 
I am convinced that both decisions are
perfectly defensible on their own merits.
"As you know, our decision not to compensate
people with hepatitis C stems from the well
-
established
 
106
policy that compensation or other financial help to
patients is only paid when the NHS or individuals
working in it are at fault.  It was simply not possible
prior to 1985 to make blood products free from
hepatitis C in sufficient quantities to treat all
haemophiliacs in the UK.
"The plight of individuals and families affected
by vCJD is, by the contrast, the result of a unique set
of circumstances for which society as a whole must bear
a
 
moral
 responsibility."
Then you go on to talk about the establishment of
a
 scheme in Northern Ireland.  First of all you told us
previously
, 
and we understand from other ministerial
evidence as well
, 
that often, perhaps mostly, letters
are written in draft form for ministers to then sign.
This letter
 
in the second paragraph
, 
last sentence
,
says
:
"
I 
[
as 
in 
you
] am
 convinced that both 
decisions
are perfectly defensible 
on their own
 merits.
"
You are writing 
here
 
to
 the Leader of the House.
Is this likely to reflect your personally held view
,
then, 
as Secretary of State at the time
?

--Result #164--

Essentially
.  
And if you remember
, 
I raised the question
in that meeting that you were referring to before lunch,
vCJD internal meeting
 -- 
I think it was me
, 
from memory
,
according to the note at least
, 
that raised the question
about what the read
-
across was to hepatitis C and the
compensation requests.  So
, 
yes
.

--Result #165--

Yes.  It would appear that Ms Cooper had asked three
questions and asked for 
a
 response to them.  Again
, 
I do
not think I need to read all of it out but the first
 
118
question in italics:
"What would have happened if the no-fault
compensation scheme had been in place at the time of the
Judgment?  Would it have made 
a
 difference and
, 
if so
,
what?"
Then Mr Lister sets out 
a
 response.  The next
question
 is
:
"By giving haemophiliacs money, what other groups
would then want compensation?  Would the floodgates open
to several more groups of people?  And if so
, 
who?"
Then Mr List
er identifies in paragraph 2 that 
if
money 
is given 
to haemophiliacs with 
hepatitis 
--Result #166--
 
"... 
the immediate group wanting compensation
would be non-haemophiliacs infected with 
[hepatitis C]
by blood transfusion
."  
This figure is given of numbers identified, 
669 
of
who 113 had received damages through the High Court
.
It then says:
"These numbers may be manageable within any
scheme.  More worryingly, it is estimated that 
there are
between 4,000 and 5,000 other patients still living who
were infected with HCV through blood transfusion who
cannot be traced."
Over the page:
"These people 
may
 
or
 may not know that they are
 
119
infected and 
a
 proportion of them could well come
forward if 
a
 compensation scheme is announced.  It is
likely that the existence of 
a
 scheme 
would encourage
people who have had a blood transfusion to seek a 
HCV
test."
Then there is 
a
 question raised as to whether
there would be documentary evidence of 
a
 transfusion.
Would it be right to understand
, 
again
, 
you don't know
whether you read this document
?

--Result #167--

Not necessarily
, 
because I think
, 
as you can see from
Yvette's questions
, 
which are reasonable enough
questions
, 
as I was indicat
ing 
earlier when is the point
that triggers 
a
 note from 
a
 minister to 
the 
Secretary of
State
, 
usually 
at
 
a
 point when they have reached
a
 position and then they want to put something to the
Secretary of State.
Clearly
, 
at this point
, 
Yvette seemed to be
, 
at
least
, 
in interrogative 
mode, 
she was still asking
questions
.
Now, 
the slight complication of this
 is that, 
as
you can see at the bottom of the bottom written piece
here, Yvette 
was, 
I think
, 
at this point about to go on
maternity leave.  I think she was the first minister
ever to take maternity leave.  So she left and then it
was handed over to John 
Hutton, 
who subsequently dealt
with it.  
So 
she was in the middle of asking some pretty
pertinent questions
, 
which really did arise from the
earlier legal judgment.
I think 
these two 
-- 
both 
the questions here and
 
122
the previous submission
, 
are actually again quite
important documents.  I studied them quite carefully
,
not then but I studied them quite carefully now.
The options that Briony Enser
, 
the official
 --
I think she had been brought in specifically to look at
what the Department might want to do in the light of the
judgment.  The fault line in her submissions is the
obvious one
, 
that all of the options were about people
with haemophilia who had contracted hepatitis C.  But
,
obviously
, 
there were another group who were
non-haemophiliacs who had contracted hepatitis C.  It is
almost akin to the difference between the Macfarlane and
Eileen Trusts, if you like.  That was 
a
 two stage
process, was it not?
I think therein lies 
a
 very important general
point
, 
which is this
, 
that any of those options might
have been fine, I don't know.  I think Briony
presumably
, 
with Charles Lister who actually responds
here
 -- 
so I presume Charles had looked over it
 -- 
the
last option
, 
which was option 5, which was 
a
 very
limited focused option
.  
I mean
, 
of course he could have
done that potentially but it wouldn't have ended the
matter
, 
because with each one of these decisions,
questions, options, and obviously the judgment earlier
in the year had highlighted this very graphically, every
 
123
time you did something, including
, 
frankly
, 
what I did
in terms of v
ariant 
CJD and the care package
, 
and so on
and so forth, it begged 
a
 further series of questions
.
Where it took you to at the end 
was 
this really
difficult place
, 
which is you are in 
a
 
bit
 of 
a
 stick or
twist situation because if you were twisting you really
then probably
, 
in order to really sort the matter, you
would be going
 
for something that looked pretty much
like no-fault compensation.  You would say this needs to
be settled, there is 
a
 really serious issue here.  On
the face of it the scale of the tragedy and the solution
that
 
is
 
being
 offered, there is quite 
a
 gap
.
The obvious problem with that is that it would
have begged further questions about which other groups
could raise perfectly legitimate concerns
 
and it would
have had big implications for the nature of how
negligence claims were dealt with by the NHS.
So I think -- I don't know what Yvette was
thinking and I don't know what Phil Hunt or
,
subsequently
, 
Hazel Blears was thinking but my sense is
that every time one did something for perfectly the
right reasons
, 
because there were very good reasons why
something should be done, it begged 
a
 further set of
questions that became quite fundamental questions
.
So this then took you to
: 
would no-fault
 
124
compensation actually have 
just 
been the 
answer
?  I know
that 
that
 
is
 
an
 issue that has been around for very many
decades 
in fact 
and I think from memory it was part of
the recommendations of the Kennedy Report on Bristol
.
And
 
Government didn't action that recommendation and it
didn't action that recommendation for 
a
 number of
reasons that 
are 
very ably set out in 
Liam Donaldson's
Making Amends 
Report
, 
and it is not just about financial
costs, it 
was 
about other issues as well.  The financial
cost 
was 
a
 major one
.
So, 
in the end it seems to me
 
now
, 
looking with
the benefit of hindsight at all of this, people in the
Department, officials, ministers
, 
you were sort in 
a
 no
man's land and there wasn't really 
an
 obvious way out of
it because the consequences of going for full blown
no-fault compensation for
,
 you know
,
 people here would
have vast implications
, 
which would
,
 of course
,
potentially
, 
impact on other groups of NHS patients
.
And this is always the problem.  As 
a
 decision-maker in
health care
, you know, 
at its most 
bald, 
the needs are
pretty infinitesimal and the resources are not.  So you
are having to make judgment calls which are quite fine
calls around some pretty fundamental resource allocation
decisions
.  
And I think
, 
having looked at all of this
again, both this useful submission from Charles Lister
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  125
and the previous one from Briony
, 
that
 
is
 what comes to
my 
mind
 at least
.

--Result #168--

I think in the end that's what happened
.  
And I think
having read the submissions, including the subsequent
ones
, 
which I don't know whether you are going on to or
not, which then went to John Hutton
 -- 
and I don't know
what was in John's 
mind
 
but he is 
a
 lawyer by
background
 -- 
and he may well have come to the
conclusion that 
I had
 just come to at the time, which
is
: oh boy, 
we can sort of eat away at this
, 
and there
is 
a
 very good case -- set of cases 
being
 made here, but
in the end it all begs 
a
 quite fundamental question
.
And that's why John, in my view
 
very sensibly
,
referred this 
particular
 issue arising from 
a
 judgment
earlier in the year to the CMO's review of clinical
negligence and specifically the question of no-fault
compensation
.

--Result #169--

Just picking the matters up briefly then in relation to
what you have just referred to and John Hutton's
involvement.
  
If we go to DHSC0004363_090.  If we go to page 2
.
We can pick this up at the bottom of the page
,
just in some email exchanges.  We can see it is said
there:
"MS(H) doesn't think offering compensation is
an
 option.  However, he asked that you look into
providing 
a
 social care support package similar to that
of the vCJD scheme ..."
If we go slightly up the page we see reference to
MS(H) 
being
 about to speak to Susan Deacon
, 
Scottish
Minister:
"He just asked me for 
a
 progress update ...  He
definitely wants you to investigate compensation for
those eligible (those who contracted Hep
 
C via blood
transfusions) who 
didn't
 take their cases to court."
 
127
Now, 
I don't need to go into 
the 
detail 
of how
thoughts may or may not have been developing, but 
the
reference there 
to speaking
 to Susan Deacon
, 
you observe
in your statement that essentially by this time there
are various developments in Scotland that now begin to
assume 
a
 certain amount of significance
?

--Result #170--

We are now in 2001
.  We don't need to go to it, but 
that
is
 when you announced 
the compensation scheme 
for vCJD.

--Result #171--

For the transcript, but we don't need it up on screen,
Lawrence, 
the announcement is NHBT000
8
988
.
Then if we go to ARCH000
33
26
, 
please.  If we go to
the second page.
We can see this is 2 October 2001.  This is the
health committee of the Scottish Parliament calling for
 
128
financial support for all hepatitis C blood transfusion
sufferers
: 
"
Financial and practical support should be
provided for all NHS patients who contracted Hepatitis C
through blood transfusion services
, 
regardless of
whether negligence can be proven
 ..."
The second paragraph explains that the health
committee was calling upon the Scottish Executive
 
to put
in place mechanisms to provide such support within
12 months.
Then 
there is 
a
 quote from the Committee convener
,
Margaret Smith
:
"Having considered the issues raised in two
petitions to Parliament, our committee is persuaded by
the 'moral' case for providing financial and practical
assistance to those individuals infected 
with
hepatitis C 
through blood transfusion services.
"
Then she continues: 
we are not advocat
ing
 no-fault
compensation or anything wider ranging.
Third paragraph 
of
 the quote from her says:
"
... 
we are 
simply 
seeking to correct
an
 inconsistency in the operation of 
an
 existing
, 
narrow
precedent, namely the precedent created when the UK
government set up the Macfarlane Trust
 ...
"
So 
it was essentially 
a
 recommendation to extend
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  129
that which was already 
being
 made available to those
infected 
with
 HIV through blood products or blood
, but
(inaudible) 
to hepatitis C sufferers
.
You told us earlier
, 
Mr Milburn
, 
about the Joint
Ministerial Committee of the Health Ministers of the
four constituent parts of the UK.
We can see that this was 
an
 issue that was due to
be discussed 
at
 
a
 Joint Ministerial Committee on Health
meeting.
If we go to DHSC6262783.  
I think I've got that
right, Lawrence
.
"
Joint Ministerial Committee on Health,
22 October 2001
.
"
If we go over the page
, 
we can see the 
"
Expected
Attendance
"
.  I'm not going to read out all the names
but we can see 
a
 range of UK ministers
, 
including
yourself, Chief Secretary to the 
Treasury
, 
Northern
Ireland ministers, Scottish ministers, Welsh ministers
all in attendance.
The next page lists 
a
 range of officials, I don't
propose to go to that.
If we go to page 4 
we
 see the agenda
.  
And just to
get a sense of 
the breadth of issues 
that were 
being
discussed
, so 
there
's
 
a
 whole range of issues there
being
 set out
: 
 
130
"6.
 
 
Lessons from Bristol and Alder Hey.
"
Then 
item 8:
"Consumer Protection Act
 - 
High Court ruling and
hepatitis C Compensation."
Before we take 
a
 quick look at what the paper on
topic 8 said
, 
my understanding from your statement,
based I think upon your understanding of the documents,
is that 
it looks like the meeting may have run out of
time and item 8 didn't get discussed
?

--Result #172--

The issue relating to item 8 begins on page 50 in terms
of the paper.  We can see it is 
a
 paper
 -- just under
the heading "A Note by the Secretaries", it's a paper 
by
officials in the Department of Health.
If we go to the bottom of the next page we can
see, picking it up at
 -- 
paragraph 8.6 refers to the
Scottish Parliament Health Committee
 
paper 
that 
we just
looked at in passing.
Then, 
under the heading "Major Issues
":
"
8.7.  
The Scottish Executive decision
 ..."
That refers to paragraph 8.5, 
I should have made
that clear, so 
that's settling Consume
r Protection Act
 
131
claims in Scotland:
"8.7.  The Scottish Executive decision is
equivalent to the new status quo in England following
the High Court ruling.  However
, 
the Scottish Parliament
Committee report puts pressure to move away from the
policy that the NHS does not pay compensation where it
is not at fault (ie that there should be no payments to
haemophiliacs and others with hepatitis C or those who
have not initiated legal action under the CPA
).  
That
line would be difficult to sustain in the rest of the UK
if the Scottish Executive commits to the Scottish
Parliament report."
Then more detail is set out in relation to that.
Then 
if we can just go to the next page,
paragraph 8.15.  The penultimate paragraph.  There is
reference there to The Haemophilia Society's 
Carpet of
Lilies
 campaign
 
seeking financial settlement for
haemophiliacs
.  
The other aims are 
a
 public inquiry and
the provision of synthetic clotting factors, so
recombinant.
I'm not going to ask you now about 
a
 public
inquiry but I 
just 
note that because we will come back
to that issue
.
The expectation, is this right, of 
being
 at this
meeting in October is there would be 
a
 discussion
 
132
amongst all the ministers about this issue but
, 
as it
happens
, 
it didn't take place
?

--Result #173--

Yes.  The obvious problem is that 
then 
Liam Donaldson
came to 
a
 conclusion about no-fault compensation which
mightn't have been what people 
necessarily
 
were
expecting to
 -- 
by the way
, wasn't that 
necessarily 
I'm
disagreeing with where he got to
.  So, 
if you like
, 
if
the way out of all of this was to sort of change the
rules of the game then the CMO's conclusions in making
amends didn't facilitate that.  So you are left with the
existing rules of the game
, 
and then you are back to
 --
so the position in England remains that compensation is
only paid on the basis of 
fault
.

--Result #174--

If we do
,
 however
,
 just look at 
a
 note that suggests
there may be some conversation anticipated between you
and Ms Hazel Blears.  It is DHSC0042275_131.
This is 
a
 fax cover sheet August 2002.  Again
,
just to put it in chronological context
, 
in Scotland
there was now the expert committee, the Ross Committee
,
looking in more detail at this issue of financial
support or compensation in relation to hepatitis C
?

--Result #175--

The reference here, there's also -- actually could we go
Lawrence, it is the same document 
but 
with 
a
 handwritten
note on, can we go to WITN69420
1
3.  This is an email
from Charles Lister at 
6
 September 2002.
It says:
"Please see the email below from my opposite
number at the Scottish Executive."
 
136
That's Mr Stoke.
"He is asking for confirmation of our position on
hepatitis C compensation to include in 
a
 paper for the
Scottish Cabinet.  I am aware that PS(PH) 
[
that's
Hazel Blears
] 
discussed it with SofS 
[
that's you
] 
who
was unequivocal in his opposition to 
a
 compensation
scheme."
Pausing there.  Do you have any observations now
on what's been reported contemporaneously by others,
that you were unequivocal in your opposition
?

--Result #176--

My first observation is unequivocal is not in inverted
commas
, 
so I don't know if he was directly quoting from
something I actually said or from the tone of what
I said
, 
but I think at that stage I had come to the view
that 
I've 
just expressed earlier
, 
which is that
 -- 
you
know
,
 
thanks to 
this sort of rock and hard place
position
, that
 if you were to pay compensation for all
the reasons that it was obvious that people thought they
had good cause to receive, that had wholesale
implications across 
a
 number of fronts.
It had wholesale applications for the very
operation of how we went about dealing with
compensation
, 
first of all
.
Secondly, it had implications in terms of the
so-called cascade effect.  How many other groups would
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  137
then, say
: 
well
, 
if it is good enough for this group
, 
it
is good enough for us.  That was 
a
 question that
obviously Yvette had asked
, 
if you remember
, 
in that
previous paper you showed just 
a
 moment or two 
ago
.
And it had implications more broadly for questions
of how we were allocating and where we were allocating
resources across the 
National Health Service
 as a whole.
I mean, 
maybe it doesn't need saying but
, you know, 
let
me say just two things.
First of all
, 
that these are questions about how
you spend resources on 
behalf
 of NHS patients
.  
Plural.
You are having to deal
,
 as ministers
,
 with sometimes
competing interests
, 
and that's obviously not
straightforward
.  
But secondly
, 
you are having to deal
with the fact that you have got 
a
 series of commitments
that you have made more broadly to the public
, 
through
the NHS plan and so on and so forth
, 
about where
resources were to be spent.
Finally
, 
I guess
, 
you are dealing with some degree
of 
uncertainty
 about what other potential 
meteors
 
are
going 
to hit you externally which may bring further
competing demands for NHS resources.
So I read with interest, 
for
 
example
, in the
papers 
an
 earlier note from my tenure as Secretary of
State from the Chief Medical Officer about the potential
 
138
consequences of vCJD 
being
 trans
miss
ible, whether
carried through surgical instruments or whatever
.
And the costs
, 
I can remember at the time feeling
that these were major potential costs that I really had
no idea how the NHS was going to be able to absorb
,
because he was talking about
, you know, 
£800 million on
improving decontaminat
ion
 services in NHS hospital
s,
equipment
.
He was talking about 
£
650
/
675 million if we had to
go to single
-
use instruments because there was 
a
 risk
that
 the prion protein that allowed the infection to
take place between humans, 
variant 
CJD, from one human
to another
 
could be passed by 
a
 surgical instrument.
So you were quickly into not the tens of millions
or
 the hundreds of millions but potentially the
billions
.
So the reason I say that isn't at all to belittle
the arguments in favour of compensation but it is to try
to contextualise them and to try to make it clear about
how decision
-
makers, including me
 -- 
and probably
primarily me
,
 in truth
 -- 
in terms of how one 
was
 having
to grapple with these issues
.  So, you know, 
you are
looking down 
a
 lens that was quite wide
.  You know,
inevitably
, 
of course, for this Inquiry, 
the
 lens
,
rightly
,
 is extremely narrow, focusing on this
 
139
particular
 issue.  
But 
when you are the Secretary of
State for Health, 
the truth is 
you have competing
interests and you have to be able to grapple with
 those.
So -- and 
I think by this time I probably had
reached the view that you were -- this isn't 
a
 great
phrase but you know what I mean -- you were stuck
between the existing position or something that was
quite far reaching which eventually
,
 of course
,
 the
Chief Medical Officer advised against doing in any case
.

Scotland because it would then lead to one in England
?

--Result #178--

I think the reasons why -- I think they were
understood -- I think the reasons 
were 
understood in
England and in Scotland.  We came to different
conclusions about what the best response was to that --
to those reasons and to what had happened in the past.
I don't think
, 
in any way
, 
shape or form
, 
either
officials or ministers were closing their minds.
I think one of the 
very 
striking things for me
,
actually
, 
as I went through the pretty extensive papers
,
was that I think ministers were in 
a
 continual process
of looking at what the right course of action was to
take
.
I think the conclusion that was reached in England
was that if there was going to be 
a
 priority in terms of
how resources 
were 
going to be allocated, it was more
 
162
that those resources should go to the improvement of
services and treatment for people suffering from
hepatitis C
, 
than necessarily into compensation for all
those awful things that had happened in the past.
Sometimes I think there is 
a
 risk in this debate
that people in England were looking as if they were
mealy mouthed and mean spirited
, 
and I think that would
be not reasonable and doesn't 
really 
concord with the
facts.  
For
 
example
, 
decisions 
that
 
is
 were taken in
England around
, 
for
 
example
, 
combination therapy, that
I know wasn't the 
Holy 
Grail and wasn't the 
answer
 but
was 
an
 improvement on what had gone before, those were
quite deliberately referred to the National Institute of
Clinical Excellence as it was then.
They were fast tracked.  That decision was made by
NICE.  It wasn't 
a
 straightforward decision
, 
in the
sense that the costs per treatment were
 about
 £10,000
per year per patient which is 
a
 relatively high number
,
but that was the right thing to do and
, 
what is more
,
directions were issued to local NHS bodies in England to
say
, "
If NICE has made 
a
 decision, which is recommending
that these treatments should be available, you have to
make them available
".  
The cost of that was around £80 million and
,
similarly
, 
we came to decisions later around
 
163
recombinants
, 
which
, 
again
, 
was quite 
a
 fine issue that
was raised
, 
I think
, 
to me by Hazel
 
and I think
Phil
 Hunt, 
but certainly by Hazel.  In fact
, it was
raised 
by both of them
, 
I can now recall.  The situation
was put to me
, 
in the light of the Committee on Safety
of 
Medicine
s
 concern that it was possible that the
previous generation of recombinants 
contained 
some
elements that potentially 
were 
human based and therefore
there was 
a
 risk of transmission of CJD as 
a
 consequence
of their usage
.
We took the decision, I think rightly, and again
I think the costs were around £80 million over
a
 three-year period, that this should be made available.
Not least -- and I think this is 
a
 significant point --
in the light of what had happened in previous times
,
that it was very sensible to try to err on the side of
caution
, 
if you like
, 
wherever possible to adopt the
precautionary principle, rather than just to assume that
there is 
a
 risk and it will be okay.
So these were decisions that were positive
decisions and
, 
obviously
, 
the hepatitis C strategy that
you were referring to earlier was part of that
, 
and all
of these things -- decisions they brought resources,
investment, with them and that was 
a
 good thing
, 
because
that was about providing more treatment and care for
 
164
people who really needed it
, 
recognising absolutely what
people had gone through.
I think that was 
a
 conscious min
d
set that I and my
ministers had.  So, yeah, I think the question of
compensation is one thing but that wasn't in any way the
decisions that we took.  It wasn't in any way to suggest
that we didn't recognise
, 
understand
, 
have huge empathy
for people who were suffering and what we wanted to try
to do is alleviate that in the best way we could
.

--Result #179--

It is the last sentence of paragraph 
20.7, 
which is the
first paragraph on 
the screen, on 
page 41.  You say
 --
actually, I'll just read 
the last two sentence
s
.
You say:
"I am
,
 of course
, aware that the distinctions were
fine ones and that these lines were 
difficult to draw."
Then you say this:
"It is also 
true that with each new 'exemption'
the general rule against paying compensation was
some
what weakened."
The payments that were in contemplation at this
stage were never truly compensation
, they were -- 
and
indeed
 previous governments have gone to pains to
emphasise that they were ex gratia payments.  To what
extent was the making of ex gratia payments truly
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  169
something that would weaken the rule against paying
compensation
?

--Result #180--

Well
, 
I think
, 
back to the point I was making earlier,
every time there was 
an
 ex gratia payment made -- so you
could argue 
that 
the 
variant CJD
 scheme was 
an
 ex gratia
payment.  Obviously there is 
a
 package of care and then
there was in addition to that, 
there was 
money made
available in recognition of the suffering
, 
et cetera
,
that people and their families had gone through.  Every
time one did that, it sort of begged 
a
 further question.
I think you can see that today.  
You know, 
John
Reid made 
a
 decision that was different from the
decision that I might have taken
.  
I understand why he
took it
, 
for very, very good reasons
, 
as he put it, of
compassion, 
which I absolutely understand.
But the truth 
is, 
it hasn't really settled the
argument.  It is still ongoing
.  
Which is why
, 
I guess
,
we are here today.
So 
I think one has to accept 
that, you know, 
every
time there was 
an
 exemption
, 
because that's how the
Department thought of it, 
let's -- you know,
an
 exemption here, 
an
 exemption there
 -- 
it did erode
a
 
bit
 the sort of notion that the basis on which these
things were done in general was somehow sustainable
, 
and
that's the reason -- one of the reasons why people were
 
170
sometimes resistant to making those ex gratia payments
for precisely those reasons, short of having
an
 alternative system
, 
which is back to this question of
no-fault compensation
.

--Result #181--

That's 
an
 incredibly difficult question to 
answer
.
Because there are no benchmarks or criteria or standards
 
172
around what is 
a
 moral judgment.  Is it 
a
 question of
the scale of suffering?  Is it 
a
 question of the
likelihood of death arising from 
a
 
particular
 issue?
Suffering would be one criteria
, 
of course
, 
the scale of
suffering.
But
, 
as I was trying to say to you earlier,
I think the moral
 -- 
or as I put it, the empathetic
question
 -- 
was one question and 
a
 very, very important
one, given everything that had happened to people.  But
that could only be in terms of making decisions.  It
couldn't be the only benchmark for making 
a
 decision
,
because you had to be able to make decisions against two
further questions
, 
which is 
a
 question of
, 
as I say
,
legality, what was possible within the constraints of
how the system worked in terms of fault and
compensation
, 
and these wider questions which we have
just been debating in these last few moments 
about,
therefore
, 
what would the wider consequences be for
policy?
Maybe this is just my own crude way of thinking
about it now
, 
at least with the benefit of hindsight and
I can see what John did was -- if you were thinking
about it through that lens of empathy and legality and
policy, John obviously
 -- 
he will speak for himself, 
but
his press statement
, 
which I read
, 
was very clear.  He
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  173
had made 
a
 decision to up
, 
if you like
, 
the decisions on
compassionate grounds but
, 
of course
, 
he still had to
deal with the consequences.
So what 
tells you
, 
I
 
think
, 
is that even people
who are good friends like we are
 -- 
I have 
a
 huge regard
for him
 -- 
you can come to very different 
judgements
because they are very fine.  They are almost
gossamer
-
like in terms of the 
judgements
 
that 
you have
got to make here
.
It's
 not really science.  There is quite 
a
 lot of
art in it
.

--Result #182--

-- and 
just look at two or three documents with you and
then ask you some questions about the issue.  The first
document is at DHSC0038521_083.  This is 8 October 2001.
It is 
a
 letter from you to Stephen O'Brien MP on behalf
of 
a
 constituent.  If we go to the third paragraph
, 
you
say:
"I know the Manor House Group
 [
a
 
particular
campaign group
] 
has raised many issues for discussion
including the provision of recombinant clotting factors
for all haemophiliac, 
a
 call for 
a 
public inquiry and
compensation for people with haemophilia ...
"
 
174
Then the last paragraph:
"I am aware that 
a
 meeting with representatives of
the Manor House Group was to be considered once
Ministers had had the opportunity to consider all the
points that the group has raised.  However these matters
are still under discussion
, 
but Ministers would be happy
to consider 
a
 meeting as soon as this is completed
."
Now, 
as we looked 
through 
other documents
,
I pointed out from time to time 
where there's reference
to an issue about a call
 for 
a
 Public Inquiry and we can
see it set out here.  Campaigners are clearly calling
for 
a
 Public Inquiry
.
If we then look at a couple of letters that were
addressed to you.  First of all, WITN1055046
, 
please.
This is 
a
 letter addressed to you, 9 April 2000.
It is from 
a
 long-standing campaigner and partner of
a
 co-infected with HIV
, 
hepatitis C
, 
hepatitis B
haemophiliac.  I'm not going to read it aloud
, 
not least
because it is as document that we looked at in the
Inquiry last week when we heard from Ms Gr
ayson.

--Result #183--

I think I would have been aware that that was around as
an
 issue.  I think
 -- 
and 
indeed
 the letter to
Stephen O'Brien makes that clear.
Maybe 
a
 couple of comments on that
.
The first is I think that my impression
 --
certainly now, I am not sure what my impression was
then
 -- 
was that the predominant issue was the question
of
 
should there be financial compensation
.  And an
important
 but secondary issue was the question of
a
 public inquiry.
I think
, 
secondly, I can't recall -- in fact I'm
pretty sure this didn't happen -- that on no occasion
was 
a
 request made to me
, 
either by officials or
ministers
, 
that the Department should consider 
a
 public
inquiry.  So in that sense
, 
in terms of the processes
that we were discussing earlier, there were other issues
that arose through that process, recombinant, the issues
around the judgment
, 
et cetera, they naturally arose
,
and that didn't, 
and 
so
 -- 
around the question of
a
 public inquiry.
And 
I think
, 
and probably this is
 -- 
if it is
alright to 
answer
 this with the benefit of hindsight
,
 

14 July 2022
          
          

  177
because it is so difficult to recollect what one was
thinking all those years 
ago
, 
but I think if I had felt
that there was 
a
 situation where there was substantial
doubt, that issue
s 
hadn't been aired in the public
domain, that there was evidence of systematic negligence
and critically, because public inquiries 
have
 
a
 very
important role to play in this regard, there hadn't been
some evidence of lessons 
being
 learned, then I might
have concluded that 
a 
public inquiry would be necessary.
But, I mean, the truth is that
 -- 
back to the lines to
take, question
, 
and the groupthink that we were
discussing earlier
 -- 
there was 
a
 very well established
view in the Department that transcended successive
governments and ministers and so on and so forth that
"the facts were established"
.
But more importantly than that, there was 
a
 very
public campaign
.  
And you see it in this letter from
Ste
phen, 
or from Carol
, 
and it was carried in 
a
 very
public way.  Most notably into both the House of Commons
and the House of Lords
.  I mean, 
particularly by
Alf Morris
, 
a
 former Labour colleague of mine
, 
who was
absolutely indefatigable
, 
and continued to raise these
questions in the House of Lords with 
Phil
 Hunt.
So 
it wasn't that there 
weren't
 issues 
being
aired
, so there was not the fact there was
 something
 
178
that 
hadn't somehow been already
 uncovered, these were
out and 
they were 
in the public domain, 
and 
usually the
point about a public inquiry is they are not.  So
I think I might have felt that a public inquiry
therefore was
n't
 necessary.
I guess two further things that I think might have
swayed
 that view had I been fully aware of them at the
time, the first is that Yvette Cooper
, 
very wisely in my
view
, 
and I wasn't
, 
I think
, 
aware of 
this
 at the time,
she did instigate 
an
 internal investigation
, 
as you
know
, 
into these questions which David Owen had
originally raised about what happened to papers within
the Department around self-sufficiency, 
a
 policy that
David had introduced 
in the 
mid to late 1970s
.
So there was 
an
 internal investigation under
 
way.
I think if I had been considering the idea of a public
inquiry
, 
I would have certainly wanted to wait and see
what that internal investigation had come up with.  As
it happens
, 
I wasn't aware of it.
The second thing I wasn't aware of
, 
and 
indeed
 
the
chairman
 raise
d
 this earlier
, 
was this fact that
Scotland had an inquiry of its own.  I guess if I had
known that
, 
and I had known that it had reached the
conclusions that it did
 -- 
arguably
 
in more difficult
circumstances than England because of the delay in
 
179
introducing heat treatment, 
you know, 
there was
an
 18
-
month difference between 1985 and 1987
 -- 
I think
that would have been 
a
 factor again swaying me against
a public inquiry I think.
So, those
, 
I think
, 
would have been
 -- 
or could
have been
,
 rather
,
 some of the things that might have
been on my 
mind
.

--Result #184--

I mean
, 
it is 
a
 very, very important question.  I think
part of the 
answer
 lies in transparency
.  
In other
words, that when things have gone wrong
 -- 
and by the
way in public policy things can quite often go wrong
,
and 
if
 you interrogate hard enough you would find 
that,
probably, 
mainly some things do go wrong
.
So I think
, and 
this is the value of the public
inquiry in 
a
 sense
, 
that that becomes 
a
 very transparent
thing in terms of the recommendations
, 
and generally
ministers or the Department responds openly and
transparently to the recommendations that a public
inquiry has made.
What I don't know is what follow
-
up there is.  So,
for
 
example
, an inquiry with which I suspect we are both
quite familiar
, 
the Kennedy Inquiry into Bristol
, 
and
I was referring to it earlier
, 
I think I'm right in
saying that it made 
a
 recommendation around no-fault
compensation which
, 
in the end
, 
was something that the
government rejected, following Liam Donaldson's report.
What follow
-
up there has been to that I'm really
 
203
not aware
, 
and 
I don't know whether 
a
 mechanism
currently exists for doing that.  
So 
I think there's
something around whether our transparency mechanisms are
sufficiently finely honed and whether they are more than
one
-
offs.  In other words, 
a 
report is produced,
a
 response is produced, and that's the end of the matter
but no one goes back to it.
I think
, 
secondly, I do think this is where the
role of the Civil Service
, 
in the end, it is what it is
described on the tin, it is 
a
 permanent Civil Service
.
It is not 
a
 
coincidence
 that the official leader of the
department is called the permanent secretary, unlike the
ministers who come and go.  So, at the heart of what the
Civil Service should be doing is really embedding that
question around how lessons can be learnt
.  
And again
,
I don't think that is probably sufficiently embedded in
what is expected of civil servants
, 
and so maybe 
that
 
is
something
, 
in terms of the Civil Service code
, 
that one
could think about.  Of course
, 
as you know
, 
there is
a
 code according to which civil servants and the Service
itself is supposed to operate.
And the final thing that I can think of off the
top of my head, if I think more about it
, 
is that
external scrutiny is very, very important in all of
this
.  
You know
, 
in ensuring that questions continue to
 
204
be asked
.  
Because you can't always assume that people
who are leading incredibly busy lives
, 
with 
a
 lot of
stuff to do
, 
are necessarily always focusing on the
lessons learned point.  
I mean, 
as I said earlier in
answer
 to counsel
, 
I think, 
you know, 
one of the things
that I think I was very pleased about in terms of the
handling of vCJD, although I don't think it was explicit
at the time, is that it seemed to me that when I looked
at the lessons from the infected blood issues I could
see how there was read
-
across into how issues were
handled internally
, 
and
,
 frankly
,
 the responses that
ministers were making.  That shouldn't have to rely on
luck or the happenstance of 
who
 is in office at which
particular
 point
.  So 
there's something about how we
institutionalise those learnings
.

--Result #185--

  
Thank you.
The second question is really rather different.
It just occurs to me from what you have said about
Lord Hunt is to ask, do you think he was rather more
 
208
sympathetic to the idea of providing compensation for
those with hepatitis C than you were, at the time
?

--Result #186--

  
It is this, I have been reflecting
, 
as
you might expect
, 
on the evidence which the Inquiry
heard on Monday and Tuesday this week from Sir Robert
Francis QC.  As part of the fulfilment of the task 
he'd
been set by Government to give independent advice
 
2
regarding the design of 
a
 workable and fair framework
for compensation, he identified what he regards as
a
 strong, moral obligation on Government to give
compensation irrespective of the conclusions of this
Inquiry
.
He felt compelled by what he had heard to urge
that significant sums should be paid as 
an
 interim
measure.  He told us that the sooner compensation gets
into people's hands, the more effective it is.  And as
we have always known in this Inquiry
, 
time is not on
their side.
As his evidence was explored two things became
clear.  First, the interim payments he suggests could be
made quickly through existing administrative routes.
Second, and by contrast, 
if 
whatever compensation scheme
such as he suggests were to be introduced by the
Government following the Inquiry's report, it could well
take appreciable further time before the final sums due
to each eligible 
person 
covered by the scheme would be
determined.
In these circumstances, it seems to me appropriate
to consider whether I should exercise the power that
I have to make recommendations and exercise it now.
Fairness demands that I allow Core Participants,
especially on this point, Governmental and public
 
3
bodies, the opportunity to make submissions to me about
whether I should exercise my powers to make
a
 recommendation that as soon as is practicable interim
payments should be made and
,
 if so
,
 the scope of those
interim payments.
Now, the issue
s
 
are
 well known to us
, 
so
I consider that ten days is 
a
 sufficient time for
submissions to be considered by those who wish to make
them.  Those submissions should address (a) whether
I should make 
a
 recommendation about interim payments
and (b) if so
, 
what the scope of the recommendations
should be
.
Any submissions should be received by the Inquiry
by close of business
.  
It is something of 
a
 movable
feast
, 
as you will have 
known from the 
experience
 of
this week, 
so 
let
 us 
say 5 pm on Monday
, 
25
 
July.
That's Monday week.
That's all that I have to say before Mary asks you
to take the oath.

Now
, 
you then had 
a
 meeting with Paul Goggins
, 
which
took place in January 2010.  Before I ask you about your
recollection of the meeting and the significance it held
for you, can we look at the briefing that you received
in advance of it.  It is DHSC5190274.  So the briefing
 
84
is dated 14 December 2009
.  
Paragraph 1 explains that:
"You have agreed to meet with Paul Goggins,
Brian Iddon 
[who was another MP] 
and some hepatitis C
infected haemophilia patient representatives."
Then there is reference to there having been
an
 earlier meeting with Gillian Merron 
in October
.
If we go further down the page
 we can see what's
identified here under the heading "Increased HIV Payment
(Macfarlane and 
Eileen Trusts
)" 
is 
what's 
anticipated to
be the criticism
s
 
that will be 
voiced 
at 
the meeting.
So 
that the: 
"Increase in Macfarlane and Eileen Trusts funding
for those with HIV 
does not meet need
. 
"
Campaigners want more par
ity with 
the 
(more
generous) 
compensation scheme in Ireland
.
"
If we go over the page there are some 
"
Key points
"
set out.  
Then 
the
 "
Suggested lines to take
", so 
this is
the Civil Service briefing or recommendation to you, as
I understand it, are
: 
we carefully considered
Lord Archer's recommendations
; 
we have already paid out
money
; 
we are going to increase the payments.  So it is
the status quo
, 
effectively
; 
is that right
?

In opposition, in your capacity as Shadow Secretary of

State for Health

 more generally

I think,
you have spoken in Parliament on 
a
 number of occasions
about issues arising out of infected blood.  I'm just
going to read the dates and the reference numbers for
three of those occasions and I want to look at the last

a
 couple of
passages and then ask you about it.  We just pick it up
with the introductory paragraph:
"Through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, may I thank
Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity to make what
will be my last speech in this House?  I make it on the
subject of contaminated blood for 
a
 simple reason:
know
ing
 what I know, and what I believe to be true,
I would not be able to live with myself if I left here
 
128
without putting it on the official record.  I will be
honest: this is 
a
 speech made with 
a
 sense of guilt in
that all of us here are collectively culpable of failing
to act on evidence that is there 
before us if only we
cared to look and, by extent, failing thousands of our
fellow citizens who are the victims of perhaps the
greatest untold injustice in the history of 
this
country."
If we 
could 
go to the last paragraph on this page,
and 
this picks up on something 
you 
have already said to
us
, 
Mr Burnham
, which is why I wanted to read it again
:
"Here is what I think is the crux of the problem.
Contaminated blood has always been viewed through
a
 financial prism.  That
 suits
 the government, it keeps
the victims in 
a
 position of subservience
, 
forced to beg
for scraps of help with the various funds that have been
set up.  By the way
, 
let me make it clear that I am
talking about not just this 
particular
 Government
 --
although I am talking about this Government
 -- 
but all
Governments.  To the extent that the public know
anything much about this scandal
, 
there is 
a
 vague sense
that it is 
an
 argument about money.  In my view, it is
in the Government's interests to keep it there; they
want to keep it there.  Why is that?  Just as with
Hillsborough, if the Great British public knew the real
 

15 July 2022
          
          

  129
story here, there would be such 
a
 wave of public support
for the victims that demands for full and fair
compensation simply 
would not be able to be resisted by
the Government.  That is the experience of Hillsborough.
When the truth was told, such was the huge groundswell
of popular support that there had to be action.  Perhaps
that is why the Government do not want the truth to be
told -- they know that there would be little place for
them 
to go in answering those 
calls
."
Then you go on to explain 
that 
you 
had 
brought
this debate to the House to 
try to 
break 
through 
that
impasse
.
Does everything you said there remain your view
today
, 
Mr Burnham
?

--Result #189--

In that speech you gave in April 2017
 
as your last
 
135
speech in Parliament, is it right to understand that two
of the practical concrete things you called for were
some form of independent investigation 
and
 inquiry and
then, secondly, if we go to the bottom of page 7 of the
Hansard report
 -- 
please
, 
Lawrence
 -- 
I can just pick it
up in the last two lines.  You respond to something said
by one of your parliamentary colleagues and you say:
"Absolutely
, 
there must be full
, 
fair compensation
now.  I say to the Government
, 
do not delay
; 
do what
Ireland and other countries have done.  They should do
that now.  They raised expectations and they should do
it.  We would all support it."
So April 2017 you called for, as you described it
there
, 
full and fair compensation
?

--Result #190--

Absolutely.  And as I say
, 
I was pleased to hear what
the Chair had to say.  I would like to praise the
Government for establishing the study into 
a
 fair
compensation framework.  I think 
that
 
is
 
a
 big step
forward.
I would like to praise the previous
Prime Minister, Theresa May
, 
who initiated this Inquiry
,
obviously with some of my input as well, but she and
I worked together on Hillsborough and we worked together
on this as well
.
But it is five years 
ago
 now.  
It's five -- 
as
 
136
everyone said today, what have those five years meant to
these thousands of people who have been left struggling?
It is five years they will never get back
.  
And this
dragging of feet in the British Government Civil
Service, you know, in whose interest?  What justifies
that?  Just because you are trying to please the
Treasury 
or -- 
it is not -- there isn't 
a
 justification
for it in my view
.  
And credit
, 
I think
, 
to
Penny Mordaunt who initiated the study into the
financial compensation.  But I would say we are in
a
 position where we are in limbo
,
 aren't we
,
 as
a
 country at the moment with 
the 
changes that are going
on.  I just hope that people can hear what's coming out
of this Inquiry and act now.  Support people now.  Don't
make them wait 
a
 day longer.

--Result #191--
 I did see a counsellor after my husband died -- w ell,
there was a couple of occasions.  When we tried to go 
for the sperm washing it was compulsory counselling
whether we wanted it or not, and I really got the 
feeling that the person doing it, it was kind of li ke,
"Oh, I dealt with somebody who had HIV today".  It was 
quite an unsettling experience. 
After my husband died I suppose with hindsight 
I was maybe suffering from post traumatic stress 
disorder and I did see a specialist bereavement 
counsellor but that wasn't arranged through -- to b e 
honest, I think my GP arranged it. 
But actually I suddenly realised I don't want 
counselling and this is why, and this is with no 
disrespect to anybody that does want counselling, 
everybody's different.  For people that are ill and
currently ill I can understand it might help, but      141 I suddenly thought I've been asked if I want 
counselling for my anger.  My anger's not 
pathological.  My anger is a completely realistic 
response to an unrealistic situation and if I say,
"Yes, I need treating for this", what I'm saying is
that, actually, I'm the one with the problem. 
I'm not the one that needs counselling.  I'm not 
the one that can't face up to what they've done.  I 'm 
not the one that's in denial.  You know, I'm not th e 
one that is pathologically addicted to lying so why
should I be the one having counselling?  You know,
this is completely wrong. 
I am going to go back to my mugging analogy.  If 
you were being mugged in the street and I came up t o 
you and said, "Would you like counselling for that" , 
you'd think I was round the bend.  You'd say, "No,
help me get this mugger off me".  This is what's 
happening to us now because we as a community are 
still being mugged.  There's no bones about it. 
People are suffering depression and points of 
despair because they are struggling on no money.  I s 
counselling going to put that right?  What we need to 
do is stop the cruelty.  You know, they are being 
stressed out because we're fighting for years and 
years and years.  Should we have counselling or sho uld      142 they stop doing what they are doing?  It's very 
simple. 
Now, I've listened to so many politicians say 
they are sorry.  I have written over the years via my
MP to Jane Ellison, David Prior, Lord O'Shaughnessy ,
Donna MacInnes, Jane -- Jackie Daw Price, everybody 's 
sorry, everybody's sorry.  They don't understand th e 
word.  They should stop using words they don't 
understand. 
I was brought up to believe that to have true 
contrition requires that you have a firm commitment
not to do it again and all the time they are carryi ng 
on with this they are not sorry.  You know, there's
a simple answer to this: simply stop it.  You know,
stop this misery now.  You know, accept that you we re 
wrong, pay the compensation and then shove off and 
leave us alone.  You know, that's it in a nutshell.

--Result #192--
 Yes.  You might have guessed there would be. 
I would like to make a couple of points that 
I hope -- well, this is points for how I see things
maybe could be done for the future and it's not 
pertaining to sorting out the issue of HIV or -- it 's 
things that have arisen.      143 It seems to me listening to all the stories and 
my own experience is that there's been a repeated 
failure of empathy.  There's been a total failure o f 
empathy.  Doctors have to be revalidating their 
skills, nurses have to revalidate their skills. 
I think there should be checks when people first go
into these professions that they have any capacity for 
empathy, because not much point being brilliant if you 
are a narcissistic little tyrant and we need to get
that out of the system at the outset. 
I can understand doctors see endless pain and 
suffering and over the years they have to protect 
themselves because otherwise they are going to be i ll,
they are going to have breakdowns, and I respect th at. 
But what needs to be ensured is that in this move f or 
professionalism that we don't swing the other way a nd 
lose that empathy.  So I think there should be, wit h 
the revalidation process, there should be some kind  of 
training, some kind of thing that enforces or -- no t 
enforces, that's the wrong word -- that reinforces 
this empathy and what it means and how it works and
why it's important.  So that's one point. 
The other thing is there's a sentence that 
cropped up in the notes over and over again and I'm
sure it crops up in other people's notes and I woul d      144 like to see it never in notes again and that is "th e 
patient was reassured".  Now, what this speaks of,
this speaks more of the doctor's narrative or the 
nurse's narrative than the patient's, because 
sometimes the patient's reassured and that's good b ut 
sometimes it just means, "I said what I had to say and 
shut the patient up".  What happens then is the nex t 
person comes along looks and says, "Oh, the patient 's 
been reassured.  They are fine with this", and then
you build a problem in. 
The patient was offered reassurance.  That's 
fine, but if you are going to say they are reassure d 
you need to explain why.  I think that sounds like 
nit-picky semantics but I think it's really importa nt 
because it builds on that. 
Moving on from that, I would like to address the 
issue of the reply from the Cabinet Office to the 
request that they pay interim compensation now. 
God, we've heard some rubbish during this 
campaign.  The reply that came back and I believe i t's 
from the Cabinet Office, that they can't pay 
compensation until the Inquiry has pronounced on 
liability.  I find it deeply disturbing that the 
Cabinet Office that is sponsoring this Inquiry does
not understand the powers of this Inquiry.  Surely to      145 goodness they should understand what the Inquiry ca n 
and can't do and, honestly, I'm sure somebody here can 
put them straight but if you are all too busy I'm 
happy to do it because this is just unacceptable. 
As for paying out compensation when it's 
finished, we have estimated that 600 people are goi ng 
to be dead before this inquiry is finished.  I cann ot 
begin to express to the Cabinet Office how much of an 
impediment enjoying your compensation will be broug ht 
about by being dead.  This is just ludicrous that y ou 
are going to wait until people are dead before 
affording them any kind of justice when you know 
that's the likely thing that's going to happen. 
So for goodness sakes, just -- now, they talked 
about having discussions with the four countries, w ith 
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and t hen 
they talked about levelling up the payments of the 
schemes across Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland  -- 
not Wales -- between England, Wales and Northern 
Ireland and Scotland has disappeared.
Now, whether they have got insider knowledge 
about the immediate departure of Scotland from the 
United Kingdom or whether this is more likely, in m y 
opinion, a deliberate ploy because only Scotland ha s 
come forward with any sensible suggestion in the      146 short-term for the widows, and I appreciate not all
widows were included in this, that some of them wer e 
still left out, but I can't see any reason why we'r e 
levelling this scheme across three administrations and 
leaving out the only one that's got it right for th is. 
I say this with the greatest respect for parents 
and children who have been left out of all of these
schemes and that is wrong.  That is so wrong.  Thei r 
suffering has been immense, children have been put 
through hell, parents have been put through hell an d 
they have just been written out of all these scheme s. 
I would like to finish my witness statement 
by -- I've written a poem in tribute to my husband 
but, before I say that, this is a direct comment to
the Department of Health and their allies, the 
American blood products companies, which is that yo u 
have weaponised the NHS and then you turned that 
weapon on your own people and you wiped out thousan ds 
of them and you injured thousands more. 
To the people that have died and to the people 
that have witnessed this, these weapons might have 
just as well been the biological weapons of mass
destruction out and while you were out looking for 
those weapons, they weren't the underground bunkers  in 
foreign lands, they were in the fridges in Newcastl e,      147 they were in the regional transfusion centres.  And
it's time that you addressed this and you came clea n 
about this. 
If this had happened on one day, if a plane had 
dropped out the sky killing everyone on board (only  in 
this case it would have been six planes) or if a li ner 
had hit an iceberg (in this case it would have been
two liners), something would have been done 
immediately.  But because these people have died on e 
at a time over years in side wards in hospitals and  in 
their own homes, you have been able to slip away un der 
cover of darkness, and I am hoping that this Inquir y 
will finally shine a light on what you've done and you 
will have to come clean and you will have to put it
right.  Thank you. 
I want to read a little poem.  Well, I won't 
read it, I'm going to recite it.  I might get it wr ong 
halfway through.  I wrote this as a tribute to my 
husband but it's also where we've fought so long, w ith 
everything else that's been taken from us, I feel o ur 
memories are now being taken because, instead of 
remembering all the lovely things, we remember all the 
battles.  And this is for my husband but it's also for 
anybody else who feels they're getting lost in this . 
It's called "For [my husband]" which means that      148 the title's going to have to be redacted out.
"You said,
You were a man with haemophilia,
not a haemophiliac. 
You'd be judged by who you were,
and not the factor that you lacked. 
Haemophiliac?  
You were so much more than that.
When you told me in hushed tones,
how HIV had scythed through your life,
it was fear of rejection, not death,
that caused your voice to crack. 
Like Hell's combine harvester, 
shredding your present and your future, 
and spraying out hopes and dreams 
as dust.  
And when I cried, it was for you 
not because of you. 
The death dust settled 
and you at first survived
to fill my life with silly games      149 and stupid jokes, 
and morning dreams 
and fragile hopes,
and a love for me 
and a love for mine,
that withstood death 
and withstands time.  
HIV?  
You were so much more than that. 
Your life was stolen,
you were cheated and betrayed,
by men who played at God,
now only God shall play. 
What I shall hold,
is your gentle smile,
your private strength,
your love of life against the odds unquenched,
and I shall not,
I cannot,
let this injustice,
nor even the fight against it 
claim you.      150 My love,
my ever love,
you were so much more than that." 

--Result #193--
 Yes.  I could sit here all day -- and I'm not goi ng 
to, Jenni -- and talk about the Macfarlane Trust. 
Because I was involved [redacted] I worked closely 
with the Macfarlane Trust; so I was working closely
with them in helping them with other people to put on 
events and to get the funding for that. 
At the very beginning the Macfarlane Trust were 
very strange.  They were this very strange entity w ho 
were basically throwing white goods at you.  Social
workers through the hospitals were calling people w ho 
had been told they were positive in and saying, "Fi ll      198 this form in.  You can get a fridge.  You can get 
a microwave".  I remember it really well.  I rememb er 
saying, "I've got a fridge.  I've got a microwave."
"Have another one".  It was seriously like that.  S o 
that was the beginning of the Macfarlane Trust. 
The Government, at the time, wanted the 
Haemophilia Society to set up this fund that became
the Macfarlane Trust.  They wanted to give it a bun ch 
of hush money to shut us up, because they thought t hat 
we were only going to live between three and five 
years.  The Haemophilia Society said, "No, we can't  be 
a support charity and give people money" which was 
right.  They didn't always do things that were righ t 
but that was right. 
So the Macfarlane Trust was set up.  It was set 
up with trustees who were -- these are my words -- a
bunch of old crusties who had haemophilia.  Most of
them had escaped getting HIV.  They were very 
moralistic about any money they would give you and 
there wasn't much money in it to begin with anyway.
It grew into a complete and utter monster.  It grew
into an under-resourced hardship fund funded by the
Department of Health, not as compensation (as we kn ow)
but as a charity to support people from being in 
poverty and to help people and their families, and I'm      199 sort of quoting from their one of their many deeds,  to 
help people and their -- people living with 
haemophilia and HIV who were living with or infecte d 
with HIV and their families.  It was set up to help
us.  But it was totally under-resourced.  It wasn't
given enough money.  
And it was also set up as a charity, so it had 
a group of trustees and a chair of trustees at the top 
who were unpaid volunteers and then they had paid 
staff underneath that.
The trustees, once again, seemed to be people 
with -- they all seemed to be very middle class;
mainly white male (not all male but mainly); 
professional people who came from banking or insura nce 
often; some from the NHS, yes; some from the legal 
profession.  Were there any -- I don't know if ther e 
were any ... 
They were mainly quite middle class, white 
people some of them with a history of haemophilia a nd 
HIV that should never have been involved because of
their history.  I hope that makes clear what I'm 
trying to say. 
So it continues to be under-resourced and it 
continues to be run rather strangely.  At one point ,
half the office seemed to be related to each other.     200 I will quite happily go on record as saying that th ere 
was nepotism in the office for people who were 
employed there. 
And there were some things going on there that 
I didn't like very much but I'm honest enough to ad mit 
that I played the game and, because I'm the sort of
person -- I'm not unlike some of the people who wer e 
trustees.  I'm quite middle class, I'm white, I wen t 
to a direct grant school which is near enough a pub lic 
school, and I went to school with these sort of 
people.  So I used that advantage and, because I wa s 
doing them a favour, I was helping them to set up 
events, I knew what I was doing, and I used that an d 
I didn't have too much trouble getting grants and 
things like that. 
But I know -- I knew then, and I found out 
certainly since the Inquiry opened and some of the 
recent witnesses that we have heard from specifical ly 
it seems to me, women who have been treated absolut ely 
dreadfully. 
My -- no, I'll finish that bit and then I'll go 
back. 
So there was a period in the beginning, then a 
period in the middle.  So this period in the middle
when I was involved, they did do some good things w ith      201 me by putting on events for people.  Not everybody 
wanted events but some people did.  They were also 
doing some things that I wasn't necessarily totally
aware of at the time that I don't agree with. 
Then suddenly that middle bit stopped ... and 
what's his name?  Roger Evans and Jan Barlow took o ver 
and from being however wrongly they behaved, some o f 
the trustees and people that worked there, for howe ver 
wrong they were, they were interested in working wi th 
us to help us to make things better and to run even ts 
and talk to us.  But almost overnight -- it wasn't it 
was probably over a few months but it seemed overni ght 
because I left -- I wasn't involved at that point 
anymore -- but almost overnight any of the working 
with beneficiaries that was there, "whoa", and not 
just "whoa" it was really aggressively "No, we don' t 
want to talk to you anymore".
They went through the motions of setting up 
meetings.  We had regular meetings.  They just 
basically washed their hands of us and said, "No, w e 
don't want anything to do with you anymore.  We are
purely a financial machines and we will give you 
money.  We won't talk to you anymore.  We will not 
discuss grants, we will not discuss how we approach
the Department of Health about budgets, we will not     202 have any more events for you, we're not going to sp end 
the money on that".
So I'm aware I'm rambling a bit about the 
Macfarlane Trust -- 

--Result #194--
 Yes, and there is no doubt.  I mean, Rosemary Biggs
wrote a book about all of this, and she posed the 
question: could we use, for the people who have onl y 
minor haemophilia, not too frequent bleeds, bleedin g,
and not many bleeding in the joints, we'd only give
cryoprecipitate?  Or small donors?  Because as your
audience will have probably already had explained t o 
them, that the bigger the pool of donors, the great er 
the risk, because one donation in a thousand will 
contaminate.  So if you come down to a donor pool o f,
say, 100, the chances are much -- well, they're 
10 per cent less. 
So, I mean, all these were being discussed and 
tried to be applied but it is difficult to decide. 
A doctor's trying to do the best for their patient.
They explain it to the parents of the child and the y 
may say, "Well, what's the treatment that's least 
likely to have any bleed?"  And he has to say or sh e 
says, "This one, but there are chances of ..."
Now, I don't know how much was being discussed. 
You know, some doctors weren't open enough about it , 
 
  33 let's face it.  All I decided -- and that was 
a political decision -- we will have no secrecy abo ut 
this in the department, we will have no secrecy abo ut 
this in letters we write to Members of Parliament.  At 
one time I actually say we must put more informatio n 
out to Members of Parliament.  They must face up to
these risks because they were getting a lot of 
questions and then when I was asked whether I would  do 
the World in Action programme I said yes, knowing f ull 
well this whole issue would be exposed. 
Of course, this was a very popular programme and 
a good programme and in two series maybe you will 
discuss this and show some things about it but this
was trying to bring it out into the wider public 
domain and so we mustn't be afraid of this.  These are 
difficult choices and, as far as possible, we shoul d 
try and tell patients about it.  As I say, you know ,
nurses were very good on this.  Nurses are better a t 
this than doctors.  Doctors in my day were rather 
hierarchical and a bit sort of keeping some 
information to themselves, nurses were much more op en 
and probably mainly because they were women and the y 
were seeing it.  So they wanted more discussion abo ut 
this and I think that gradually the influence of 
nurses and more and more of the treatment began to be  
34 done by nurses not by doctors because they would ge t 
specialised in this form of treatment and they woul d 
talk to the patients and they would explain it more . 
But -- I know this and many people have said to 
me and families, you know, because they come and ta lk
to me about this, compensation and things like that , 
and they say, "But I was never told".  Maybe they 
weren't but you can be told about something and shu t 
it out.  That's again human nature.  You face up to
the choice, you make the decision and you hope and 
pray that it won't be -- you won't be the one.  Tha t's 
another instinctive feeling of people, you will 
somehow be the lucky one.

--Result #195--
 You said in part of your evidence this morning 
something which I pricked my ears up at.  It was in
the context of your advocating something like the 
New Zealand system of no fault compensation and you
said this:  
"... we've got to stop relying on governments to 
make awards or judgments of liability and inadequat e 
payments after years of pressure in Parliament and all 
this and go for the New Zealand system, with no fau lt 
compensation, and take it out of law courts and tak e 
it out of all this confrontational system and accep t 
that in healthcare we sometimes damage patients.  N ot 
willingly, not wantingly sometimes out of ignorance ,  
171 sometimes ..." 
And this is the part I want to ask you about:  
"... sometimes out of, in this case, deliberate 
decision." 
So you see it as a deliberate decision that was 
taken by someone, or some system, that had the effe ct 
of hurting patients?

--Result #196--
 Well, they were contractual, so you saw that in the
Armour -- you had a decision to take whether they 
would be given the contract.  I presume that by 
warning them that we were going to abide by the WHO
resolutions that you were telling them, effectively , 
192 "Your contract could be curtailed".  Now I didn't l ook 
at the contract, I'm sure, but I imagine that,
subsequent to warning them, they would make some 
provision in the contract for termination or they 
would make the contract for -- well, not for 20 yea rs 
or -- you know ... 
You know that you make decisions and expect,
then, certain consequences to flow from them.  So i f 
you tell Armour that that is -- you expect then the
contract division to take some account of it. 
Now maybe they didn't.  Maybe I should have 
followed up on that to find out whether they did or
didn't, but I was -- there is no doubt we would hav e 
cancelled the contract, but at that stage it would 
have been a sensible decision to make sure that the
contract wasn't going for too long otherwise the 
compensation would be considerable.  That was 
presumably my intention when I said them, was to 
reduce the -- I mean, you were into a commercial 
relationship and I imagine and hope that they were 
given no long-term contract.

--Result #197--
 I think that I do feel actually guilty that I've 
dragged, you know, the people around me who have lo ved 
me into, you know, me doing almost like a headless 
chicken, pursuing what I did do without any guidanc e 
or advice as to -- nobody to say, well, hang on,
perhaps you should think about this, with 
justification, perhaps, because we were always hopi ng 
for some compensation and also for some truth, whic h 
might have affected my decision. 
So in a way I've just ploughed on over the years 
and dragged the people around me with me and I susp ect 
that, you know, hindsight that's been fairly 
selfish -- not deliberate -- by the way it's been a nd 
I have some regrets on that.

--Result #198--
 You said in your statement he had to give up all 
opportunity to claim for any other compensation in the 
future?

--Result #199--
 Yes, that was a requirement of accepting the mone y 
from the Macfarlane Trust, which was purported to b e 
a no fault compensation scheme, that they had to 
actually sign that you wouldn't sue for anything el se 
no matter what arose and, as time goes by, it becam e 
obvious that that was hepatitis B and hepatitis C i n 
addition to HIV. 
The other thing that upset me really was,
I mean, as I mentioned, we were lucky, well, in a w ay,
lucky in that he happened just to have turned 16 wh en 
the mass -- the mass action was proposed and becaus e 
he was 16, he could apply for Legal Aid because the re 
was always a risk that you might be required to pay
legal fees or the costs of the action.  That was on e 
potential outcome and he could apply for Legal Aid so 
that was not a worry to us.  All we had to pay was 
a small amount of money as his what they call best6 friend. 
But then because he was young he got £20,000 
which I always thought was -- I mean, I appreciate 
that people with families and -- spouses and famili es,
would merit more because but just being under 21 it
seemed to me to be very poor value on life really a nd 
I think for people with even younger children I thi nk 
their awards were very, very small, which just seem ed 
to be an inappropriate valuation of somebody's life
and a person of Alistair's age, 22, could 
reasonably -- should really have been able to expec t 
to have a potential wife or family in the future an d 
I didn't see why they thought he was less valuable 
because he happened to be younger. 

--Result #200--
 Yes, I understand that.  It's the highlighted passa ge 
towards the bottom.  And if we just pick it up befo re 
the highlight with -- can we go to the passage just
above that, Henry, to put it in context.  This is - - 
Dr Biggs, says: 
"The next thing that started to crop up was that 
patients started to get jaundice, and we felt at th e 
time that they were better alive and having jaundic e 
than dead with haemophilia."  
156 And then your response was: 
"That's the most amazing comment.  I get very 
irritated with patients now who are demanding 
compensation because they have got hepatitis C from
concentrate, but they wouldn't be alive to make tho se 
kind of complaints if they hadn't been treated." 
That's the first I wanted to draw to your attention . 
I then want to draw another, and then I want to jus t ask 
you a question if that's okay.

--Result #201--
 Yes.  You kindly sent this to me last week.  And wh en 
I read that now, I think perhaps the word "irritate d"
is strong, and I think what I was really trying to 
express there was frustration.  And let me explain.
Dr Biggs made this quite brutal statement -- I've 
written about this; it's in many of my papers -- th at 
patients were better getting jaundice than being de ad. 
And it's presented very harshly, but what it's sayi ng 
here is what we've been discussing throughout.  And
it's a balance between risk and the necessity of 
treating.  And what she's got on her scales is the 
risk of treatment, which at the time she was workin g, 
there were patients getting jaundice, and the -- if
you don't give the treatment, there's the possibili ty 
of dying. 
And I would take you back to the fact that in 1937, 
 the life expectancy was 20 years.  Towards, I would  say, 
the beginning of the '90s, it was approaching 70.  And 
this was at the cost of having hepatitis and sadly,  for 
many people, HIV.  But the other side of it was peo ple 
lived a life.  And, indeed, as early as 1981, there  was 
an anonymous leader in the BMJ, which I think was 
probably written by Peter Jones who I think you may  be 
talking to, and he makes the point that the side ef fect 
of hepatitis may be the cost of having this very 
effective treatment.
I think the other issue that I would just say about
this is that I think the Macfarlane Trust and the 
Skipton Fund are wonderful.  And I believe, truly 
believe, that any patient who has any treatment for
which they have really severe side effects should h ave 
financial support, as far as possible, to make thei r 
life better. 
But what I don't like about the idea is the idea of
compensation because what compensation does, it sug gests 
liability.  And I truly believe that people at that  time 
were doing what they thought was the best, and the side 
effects were really not at all clear, and certainly  HIV 
was a tragedy that nobody could have foreseen.  And  of 
course, the other thing that we haven't really talk ed 
about at all is this lethal combination of HIV and HCV. 
158 And many of our patients, and I think this probably  goes 
for the majority of patients who had HIV, they 
progressed so fast to liver failure, and we couldn' t 
have seen that. 
And, you know, it's very easy retrospectively to 
say, "Ah, but the HIV all came from America," and t hat's 
true up to a point, but there were occasional donor s who 
had it here.  The infection in Britain came much --  sort 
of a year later.  We were lucky we could do de-refe rral 
at Blood Transfusion Centres which mitigated it to 
a certain extent. 
So I suppose, you know, when I read this, when you 
sent it, I just felt that my choice of words was no t 
very good and rather insensitive in this interview.   But 
I think what I was irritated about was that I had n ot 
been able to explain or convince people that what w e did 
was in good faith, if you like.  For the knowledge at 
the time.

--Result #202--
 It's a similar reflection that I have for the Rosem ary 
Biggs comment, or in that article, in that I really
supported and continue to support the idea of the 
Macfarlane Trust and Skipton Fund which is giving 
support for hardship, but I think that compensation  is 
the wrong thing to do because it suggests liability . 
And I think at the time I conducted this, I was 
feeling particularly aggrieved, and I think it woul d 
not be appropriate to tell the Inquiry who this 
patient was.  But I was particularly aggrieved beca use 
a patient had received -- and this was hearsay of t he 
amount -- but had received £80,000 as an out-of-cou rt 
settlement.  And I had been asked about this case, and 
I had seen the notes, and if that had gone to court ,
I think it wouldn't have shown any liability.  And 
I was feeling aggrieved that the National Health 
Service had paid out this money really that was 
unjustified.
I think it is right for any medical treatment, if i t 
causes harm that wasn't expected, the patient shoul d be  
 supported.  But I think the idea that we would -- a nyone 
who is a decent person would give somebody some 
treatment that they knew would cause harm is frankl y 
ridiculous.  And it's actually quite hurtful for th ose 
people, those many people who cared for patients. 
I mean that's -- I really don't want people to thin k 
I'm a hard, unsympathetic person because I'm not.  These 
people have always been part of my life.  They're s till 
part of my life.  I sometimes see them.  I've got a n 
ornament of a Greek student who died on my shelf.  Every 
day I see that, and I see this man.  It was the sad dest 
tragedy of all, but I think to suggest culpability is 
wrong.  Sorry, my speech is over, but I -- it does upset 
me.

--Result #204--
 We will just have a look at that. 
Paul, it's 2554015, please. 
This is in 2002, so the year after you had had 
the conversation with Professor Collins, and this i s 
a letter from the Minister for Health and Social 
Services, Jane Hutt, to your assembly member.  It 
refers to a letter concerning compensation for 
haemophiliacs infected with hepatitis C virus and 
exposure to variant CJD.  It expresses sympathy and
regret but then says this: 
"My position on this issue remains unchanged. 
I have met with representatives of the Haemophilia 
Society and listened to the arguments for a special      59 payment scheme and a public inquiry.  After long an d 
careful consideration the Government came to the 
conclusion that a special payment scheme should not  be 
established and a public inquiry would not provide 
a satisfactory answer.  Both the UK Government and 
ministers and myself when first appointed as Health
Minister reviewed this decision and have reached th e 
same conclusion.  It was a very difficult decision to 
make and not one that anybody has taken lightly.  A ll 
those involved with this issue and who have met wit h 
individuals directly affected by this have found th is 
the most difficult position to arrive at." 
Then it refers in the next paragraph to Assembly 
Government policy that compensation or other financ ial 
help to patients is only paid when the NHS or 
individuals working in it are at fault:  
"In general, there is no 'no fault 
compensation'.  The fact is that the technology to 
make blood products free from hepatitis C in 
sufficient quantities to treat all haemophiliacs in
the UK was simply not available prior to 1985." 
Then in the next paragraph there's reference to 
a compensation fund for victims of vCJD and then at
the last two sentences it says this:
"In terms of NHS treatment the risk of vCJD0 transmission through human blood transfusion or blo od 
products used in the treatment of haemophilia remai ns 
theoretical.  There is no evidence worldwide that C JD 
or vCJD have ever been transmitted through blood or
blood products." 
If we look then please at the next letter, Paul.
We can see your Assembly Member writing back to 
you giving you that response and saying to you that
she was more than happy to support compensation cla ims 
for haemophiliacs who had been exposed to variant C JD. 
She refers to the statement that there's no evidenc e 
worldwide that CJD or vCJD has ever been transmitte d 
through blood or blood products and then says this:
"Clearly from our discussion this is not the 
case", and then there's a discussion about continui ng 
to pursue the matter. 
That is part and parcel of what you have 
described as some of the campaigning you have done 
behind the scenes.

--Result #205--
 Yes, I think the financial assistance that we've been2 given, considering what we've lost, I've lost hundr eds 
of thousands of pounds.  Considering what we lost t he 
financial compensation isn't anywhere near enough.  As 
David Cameron said it should be meaningful and wort h 
while and it should be related to the way that we'v e 
suffered and we are all suffering. 
So I think that the Government should give us 
parity with all the English victims of this because
they get paid a hell of a sight more than us and th at 
is not fair.  We've all gone through the same thing . 

--Result #206--
 Oh right.  Firstly, I would like to thank the cha ir 
and all your staff, sir.  I think you have done 
a wonderful job.  You've opened up Pandora's box. 
Please don't let the Government of any political 
persuasion close the lid on you until you have come  to 
your conclusion, which I personally would hope woul d 
include the provision that your civil servants not 
necessarily under your control if you wish to retir e,
sir, control any future compensation for any person
who has put in papers to you in the form of witness
statements, which to me shows a commitment of the 
general public to get answers and a result, because  at 
the moment it is a chaotic financial situation for all 
the people that have put in papers to you. 
There are differences between the four areas of 
the United Kingdom, which promises were made in Mar ch 
we'd all be equalled up and, to the best of my 
knowledge, nothing has happened at all about it.
I have a proposal to put to you, an idea, but 
I won't do it at this point, I will put to you in 
private afterwards, if I may be cheeky enough, and 
that -- but I must say it is based around the fact 
that one of the soliciting companies based in Londo n 
called Collins sent a letter to my Watkins & Gunn      103 informing me, to inform me, that they could no long er 
deal with me because I was an affected person by 
somebody who had died of blood transfusion.  So the y 
won't want to know anything about -- they don't wan t 
to do anything about me so I don't want them to do 
anything with my documents and I would like them ba ck. 
Can I ask you to ask them back? 

--Result #207--
   Thank you, sir.  
Good morning, sir.  Good morning, everybody.
I introduce myself, I'm a member of the legal team which
represents the Scottish Government, one of the
Core Participants in this Inquiry.
My role here is solely to represent the Government.
We have, it's true, provided assistance to some of the
witnesses, civil servants who currently work in the
Scottish Government, as well as former ministers and
former civil servants in the Scottish Government, in
preparing their statements for the Inquiry, but I'm not
here to represent them.
I should say while on this subject that the Scottish
Government has also provided many documents to the
Inquiry and arranged for numerous witness statements to
be given and it remains ready and willing to assist the
Inquiry in completing its work.
I'm going to be quite brief in these submissions.
What I'd like to do before I come to add some points to
the written submissions is to begin with an apology.I do so because the Scottish Government is acutely aware
of the suffering of those who were infected with HIV or
with hepatitis as a result of NHS treatment with blood
or blood products.  It profoundly regrets that anybody
should have suffered in that way.
Now, the evidence given to the Inquiry has made the
extent of that suffering clear and it's also shown how
people, infected or affected, have been let down by many
people over many years.
The Scottish Government also deeply regrets that
it's taken so long for Government to listen properly to
the concerns of those people and to take action, and we
recognise that the long delay has added to the hardship
and to the distress.
In March 2015, following the publication of the
report of the Penrose Inquiry, the First Minister made
a statement to the Scottish Parliament and in it she
apologised on behalf of the Scottish Government and on
behalf of the NHS in Scotland to everyone who has had to
deal with the devastating impact of infected blood or
blood products.  She mentioned that she could not begin
to understand the difficulties and many hardships which
individuals and their families had had to contend with.
And on behalf of the Scottish Government I make this
apology again and it's a sincere apology to everyone whohas been infected or affected.
In her statement, the First Minister also said that
we must do everything in our power to ensure that such
terrible events never ever happen again, and that is why
this Inquiry is so important.
The evidence given to the Inquiry by those who were
infected or affected has been delayed and it has been
harrowing.  We can now understand those difficulties and
hardships at least a bit better.
Giving evidence about, and reliving, these traumatic
events cannot have been easy, and we acknowledge the
courage of the witnesses who have given evidence to the
Inquiry and assisted it in coming to understand how
their lives and the lives of people close to them have
been affected by their infection.
Making this renewed apology is really the most
important thing I can do in these closing submissions.
Nonetheless, I will turn to a few further points.  First
of all, a few points to set out the scope of the
submissions I am making.  I note that in our written
submissions we've given a brief account of some issues
which confronted Scottish administrations in the past.
Many of those arose prior to devolution.  Now, as the
Inquiry is aware, prior to devolution, there was a fair
degree of operational independence in NHS bodies inScotland but the NHS was actually responsible to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, who was a minister in
the United Kingdom Government.
That has changed since devolution, and it's now
responsible to the Scottish Government.
For the period prior to devolution, therefore, prior
to 1999, the submissions which have already been made on
behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care are
also relevant to issues which arose in that period in
Scotland.
So far as our written submissions are concerned, we
attempt to marshal the main elements of evidence which
bear on what was done by Scottish administrations in the
past both before and after devolution.  But it's only
a summary and this Inquiry has a much fuller picture of
the relevant events than is available to the Scottish
Government, and weighing the evidence, reaching
conclusions about it, are of course for the Inquiry
alone.
This morning I'm not going to go over the
historical, as it were, material which we've set out in
our closing submissions.  In what I say today, just as
in our written submissions, we are not seeking to
advance any case or any line of argument.  We're not
seeking to justify or excuse what was done by ministers                
      5or civil servants in previous administrations and, on
the other hand, we're not seeking either to criticise
particular individuals for what they did at the time.
All of those things are, we think, for the Inquiry to do
in its report and, indeed, if criticism is warranted,
then, no doubt with appropriate caution, the Inquiry
will criticise those whom it feels ought to be
criticised.
Today what I'd like to do is address only two
topics.  The first is to make some comments additional
to our written submissions about the compensation
framework proposed by Sir Robert Francis and second is
to comment briefly on some recommendations made by other
Core Participants.  Those are, in particular, the ones
made by Thompsons Solicitors since those ones are
directed specifically at the situation in Scotland.
So turning, then, to the compensation framework.
It's important to say this at the outset: the Scottish
Government supports the payment of compensation and the
setting up of an appropriate scheme to deliver it.  We
strongly support also the key principle which underpins
the Francis framework, namely that there is a decisive
moral argument for making payment to those infected and
affected, without the need to establish legal liability.
Indeed, that is the basis on which the Scottish InfectedBlood Support Scheme, or SIBSS, already operates.
We also acknowledge this is a unique situation, not
least because the victims have had to wait so long for
proper support.  Our understanding is that most of those
infected and affected would rather claim under
a compensation scheme than go to court, and that
underlines the importance of devising a scheme which is
comprehensive, complete and works well for those who
will make claims on it.
It's Cabinet Office which is taking the lead in
considering how best to implement the proposed
compensation scheme, no doubt in light of
recommendations which this Inquiry will go on to make.
The Scottish Government, and indeed the other devolved
administrations, expect to be involved in detailed
discussions about the structure of the scheme and we are
looking forward to taking part in those.  Our hope is
that agreement on how to proceed will be reached on
a four nations basis.  In our submission, that would be
appropriate.
For the same reason, we also think it would be
appropriate that the scheme should be funded by the
United Kingdom Government, because those who were
infected were infected before devolution took place.
So far as reaching the agreement about the scheme isconcerned, there are a lot of matters of detail to
consider, but those are not a matter for today.  But
a critical issue on which it may be helpful to give the
Scottish Government's perspective is this: at the most
general level, it's the issue whether the scheme should
be uniform across the United Kingdom or ought, on the
other hand, to take account of local conditions in the
various nations of the United Kingdom.  I have just four
general observations to make about the scheme which the
Inquiry may possibly wish to consider.
This is the first: we accept -- and indeed, this was
Sir Robert Francis's view -- we accept the desirability
in principle of establishing a United Kingdom-wide
compensation scheme.  The notion underlying that is that
the infected and affected community in each part of the
United Kingdom should be treated in the same way, and we
think that's a key aspect of fairness.
Having said that, however, the Scottish Government
remains committed to the benefits of retaining the SIBSS
scheme, which I've already mentioned, to retaining it as
a separate Scottish seem for continuing support
payments.
Now, that's consistent with the general position of
parity of approach throughout the United Kingdom, but it
would give flexibility to retain a separate Scottishapproach where the members of SIBSS would prefer that.
I could give one example.  The current system under
SIBSS is that beneficiaries in the group of hepatitis C
stage 1 sufferers are able to make self-assessments in
which they place themselves in one of three categories
based on how affected they are by the virus.  That has
wide support within the community in Scotland, as
I understand it, and that's the sort of thing where the
Scottish dimension is, we think, of value, and to have
differences, to some extent, differences of approach, is
of course entirely within the spirit of devolution.
Coming to my second point, establishing a United
Kingdom-wide scheme inevitably gives rise to a question
how the scheme should deal with situations where the law
across of the four United Kingdom nations is not the
same.  The Scottish Government is aware that the Inquiry
has obtained evidence considering the extent to which
heads of damages in personal injuries litigation are the
same in Scotland as in England and Wales.
Broadly speaking, since the principle which
underlies awards of damages is the same in each of these
jurisdictions, that the claimant, to the extent that
money can do this, should be put in the same position as
if he or she had not suffered the injury, given that
underlying principle, there's a significant                
      9correspondence between the heads of damages which are
recognised.  But in our written submissions we've drawn
attention to what might be called four structural issues
which nonetheless could have the effect that the same
case would attract a different award on either side of
the border, Scotland on the one hand, England and Wales
on the other.
Those four points -- I don't propose to go into the
detail again, it's in the submission -- are: firstly,
different discount rates; secondly, the fact that Scots
law does not recognise the concept of aggravated
damages; thirdly, different rates of interest awarded on
damages; and fourthly, the treatment of damages in fatal
claims where the governing legislation is different on
either side of the border.
This is not the place to discuss these issues in
detail, so the only point I am making here is that while
some variation across the United Kingdom nations may be
entirely appropriate, significant differences in the
levels of award does not seem justifiable.  These four
structural issues are capable of having a significant
impact on the level of awards, and therefore leading to
unequal treatment, and it's therefore important that
they be considered and resolved before a scheme is put
in place. 
    10So that was the second point.
The third point also flows from the potential for
unequal treatment, and it's a point we again make in the
written submissions, which is about the extent to which
account ought to be taken of payments made under
previous schemes.  I should make it clear that this is
not a point about penny pinching; nobody is arguing
against payment of substantial compensation to those
infected and affected.  Nor are we suggesting that every
past payment should be deducted.  The only point we
make, as a matter of fairness, is that equal treatment
of those affected or infected should mean that the
scheme treats individuals in the same or similar
circumstances in the same way.  In short, they should
all be compensated fairly.
We think that points towards looking at the whole
picture over the years, rather than starting completely
afresh when the new scheme commences.
The fourth point I make is this: it relates to one
of Thompson's recommendations, which is that awards
which were made to settle litigation should not be taken
into account under the new compensation framework.  Now,
that's a departure from Sir Robert Francis's
recommendations which were that such sums should be
deducted on a like-for-like basis from awards made under 
    11the scheme as long as it was possible to identify the
elements which the settlement covered.  He mentions that
in his report, for example, in paragraph 2.57 and 9.6.
The Scottish Government agrees with Sir Robert Francis
on this point, because it reflects the general principle
of restitution, which I've already mentioned.
Now, those are the only points I'd like to draw
attention to in relation to the compensation scheme, and
of course they're all matters for the Inquiry to
consider and on which it will reach its own view.

--Result #208--
   Yes, I can see on particular facts that that                
     13might well be said, sir, yes.  I think what it comes
down to essentially is that one can distinguish between
support on the one hand and compensation on the other,
and when one draws that distinction it may be easier to
see which payments, if any, ought to be taken into
account and which ought not.  Because, essentially, as
I say, we're not arguing against the payment of
substantial compensation.  We're not arguing that people
should be in a position where they are suddenly faced
with having to repay support payments.  Clearly not.
The concern is only that, if one has certain individuals
who have received very substantial payments, then one
has to be able to understand why, on Sir Robert
Francis's proposed framework, other people will be
treated in a different way.  Really, the point goes no
further than that.

--Result #209--
   Afternoon, everyone, both here and watching
remotely.
My name is Nicola Leahey, and I thank you for giving
me this opportunity to present my closing statement,
which I've entitled Blood Is the River of Life .
Some might say that we're nearing the end, but for 
    28us it will never end.  This trajectory has changed our
lives, shortened lives, lost lives, lost our futures,
tainted our spirits, made us mistrust and lose
confidence in ourselves and others.
I was infected with hepatitis C following blood
transfusions in 1975 and/or 1980.  I was only diagnosed
in 2009, and received the horrific treatment of
ribavirin and interferon in 2010 and consequently
suffered the life changing effects.
I felt that my body had been absolutely violated,
that I'd been physically and mentally abused, stripped
of my dignity, my self-esteem diminished.  I mourned my
lost opportunities.  I felt betrayed.  I lost faith.
But I discovered you lot in 2018.  It was so
wonderful to meet others in the same situation -- sad,
but wonderful -- who understand the worry and
uncertainty, the fear of the unknown, the stigma, the
guilt of surviving when others lose the battle.  We are
united.  Thrown together through no fault of our own by
one common theme: contaminated blood.
I have read, researched and listened.  I have learnt
a lot about the illnesses, about fellow victims, about
people, those in authority, about organisations and
about myself.  Just prior to my diagnosis, I'd taken
early retirement because I'd lost confidence in myself,                
     29because of the lethargy, the brain fog and generally
losing myself.  The power of this community and the
support networks have been a life saver.
Now, with the greatest respect, I have come to
realise that the vast number of personnel involved in
this Inquiry, and beyond, have had the security of wages
and salaries because of our plight.
Many of our community have been denied that
privilege of education, careers, furthering careers, and
the security that goes with it.  We have not had that
security of a life free from anxiety, pain, suffering.
Instead, we've had the uncertainty and fear of the
future and eventual death.
Yet, all we ask is to be treated with empathy,
respect and dignity.  We shouldn't be made to feel like
beggars receiving handouts, tossed to us whenever or
however the powers that be make that decision.  Our
predicament, through no fault of our own, has now lasted
for many decades, unnecessary suffering and numerous
deaths, consequential medical and psychological trauma,
medical and administrative failures, failed promises and
knock-backs.
No wonder our faith and confidence in the very
constitution of our country has been shattered.
The Inquiry has produced a mass of statistics but, 
    30as I well know because statistics was part of my job,
data is meaningless without the facts behind the
figures.  The facts are here: the people, the lives, the
deaths, the suffering, the injustices.  We have long
awaited recognition and action and we now need to have
our confidence in fairness and morality restored.
This Inquiry has highlighted so many areas in need
of change and improvement.  Some are to such an extent
so obvious, and that's what makes it so infuriating.
I truly believe that the evidence heard has proved
that this has been a multi-system failure that has
categorically been allowed to fester and grow, much to
our detriment.  In my evidence in Leeds, in June 2019,
I spoke about lessons learnt.  So please, let's learn
from what has been termed the worst tragedy in NHS
history.
Lawrence.
My recommendations fall into three categories and
relate to communication, education, support and finance.
I'll start with the recommendations that I'd like to see
in relation to communication.
The establishment of improved communication between
all health care providers.  I am aware that at least
20 years ago, a national electronic system was planned
which would connect all institutions and departments for 
    31all health information to be accessed wherever we are
nationally.  Yet we still have big gaps of patient
information being available and shared.  Surely in this
day and age of technology we should be capable of having
a national and, indeed, an international system.
Number 2: the establishment of a patient passport
for all hepatitis C and B patients, HIV patients and all
recognised association conditions.  These are already in
existence for cancer, diabetes, cognitive problems and
other conditions.  This would alleviate the stress
endured by the constant worry of what is now happening
to our bodies.  We have been ignored in the past, which
has increased the time between diagnosis and treatment,
and, therefore, contributed in many cases to early loss
of life.
Number 3: the establishment and support for Freedom
to Speak Up initiatives, within all departments, both
governmental and NHS.  The Inquiry has highlighted the
lack of acceptance and encouragement for personnel to
feel able to and confident to voice their concerns.
Number 4: the establishment of clearly defined
policies that should be implemented, adhered to and
audited.  During my career in the NHS, cut short by the
effects of hepatitis C, the difference between policies
and guidelines was distinctly laid out.  A guideline is 
    32a "should".  A policy is a "must".  I have observed,
during the Inquiry hearings, that the lack of clear
policies has given people in positions of responsibility
the opportunity to individually interpret and perhaps
disregard important decisions relating to the quick and
timely identification of treatment of diseases and their
effects.
Number 5: the production of a flowchart, simple
flowchart, describing the process for seeking advice,
support and application for medical and financial
assistance once diagnosed with hepatitis contracted from
infected blood.  This would signpost the infected
patients to where to seek medical records and evidence,
and how to join the support groups.  Also, importantly
it would assist the medical professionals in identifying
patients and the process for the treatment and the
support available from the relevant schemes.
Victims' evidence has demonstrated how the lack of
clinicians knowledge and awareness has caused needless
stumbling blocks resulting in delays and frustration.
My second set of recommendations that I'd like to
see are in relation to education: the establishment of
continuing education and awareness, especially for the
medical profession and supporting professionals.
It is essential to recognise the importance of                
     33treating patients as individuals, recognising and
accepting that the patient is more than likely the
expert of their own body, their feelings, et cetera,
whilst the medical professionals are the experts in
caring for that body.
If I may, I suggest educating all healthcare
professionals in the skills of communicating with
patients in an individual way that can be understood.
That can go down now, Lawrence, thanks.
Teaching and observing the way that professionals
inform patients of sensitive and bad news.  How many
times have we had this bad news given to us in
inappropriate places?
Teaching the art of encouraging patients to ask
questions and giving them the opportunity to be part of
that pathway of care.
Teaching and practising the principles of the duty
of candour, along with the importance of openness and
transparency in all healthcare settings.  This has so
much been an obvious omission in a lot of the evidence
that we have heard.
Now, education and new research is a component for
continual professional development.  One of the examples
of importance of research findings that we've heard was
research findings were not being widely distributed and 
    34shared with the right people, and it was the lack of
awareness in the best practice to reduce the number of
unnecessary -- unnecessary -- blood transfusions.
Teaching the importance of recordkeeping,
documenting why a document was required and informing
the patient of the reason for that decision.
Raising awareness of the importance of recording all
decisions, and that it is just as important to document
why something was not done as well as documenting what
was done.  And that is so important, documenting why
they didn't do something.
Teaching and a raising awareness in the taking and
documenting of consent.
Teaching the importance of the correct comprehensive
recording of information on death certificates.
Something else that we keep hearing about.
Teaching and raising the awareness of recording and
auditing and learning from such things as adverse
events, serious incidents and near-miss incidents.
That's education.
Now, my final set of recommendations that I'd like
to see are in support of support and finance: the
establishment of a universally agreed policy approach to
the ongoing medical and psychological support for all
victims, thus ending the postcode lottery that now 
    35exists.
People should be entitled to the same level of care
wherever they reside.  We need to have reassurance and
confidence in the very same healthcare system that has
failed us.  There needs to be a better understanding of
the importance of the patient's ongoing welfare; the
patient requires that continual reassurance that
everything is okay.
There are many patients like myself which, who
following treatment have been declared free from
hepatitis C and then discharged with no more regular
follow-ups.  But how do we know that our liver is not
further deteriorating or that we have developed liver
cancer, if we don't have regular ultrasounds or
FibroScans?  I have regular blood tests to allay my
fears but not all victims have understanding GPs, and
I would definitely like to see it as a normal occurrence
for us to have regular, once-over check-ups, similar to
a Well Woman/Well Man check-up.  Surely we're owed that?
Number 2: the commitment to a secure future funding
to organisations such as the Hepatitis C Trust, to
provide the essential, ongoing support for victims.
Their support, advice and just being at the end of
a phone has been so beneficial to so many.  Also, I must
say that the Hepatitis C Trust Zoom meetings are so much 
    36appreciated.
Number 3: the establishment soon of a funded
initiative to get the whole nation tested for
hepatitis C.  We've heard about the look-back exercises
in some parts of the country.  Why not everywhere?  Why
not now?  Again, it demonstrates the importance of
documentation in patients' records, as well as the
importance of accurate and complete communication
between secondary and primary health clinicians.
Number 4: the establishment of an arm's length body
to manage the process of assessing and paying the
compensation agreed.  This was recommended in Sir Robert
Francis's report, but nothing has been heard of it.
I feel it is imperative that this body be professionally
led, trained in the history and the life-changing impact
of the tragedy and understands the necessity to act
swiftly to reach a satisfactory conclusion with empathy
and respect.
Number 5: to establish further interim payments for
all the infected and affected people, especially if the
final settlements are to be in the distant future,
a future that so many might not have.
Number 6: the establishment of a robust,
administrative system to honour and guarantee for life
in legislation, the continuation of the regular                
     37financial support, thus providing reassurance and
security.
Number 7: importantly, the recognition and inclusion
of all those infected and affected by contaminated
blood, the self-clearers, the bereaved parents, the
bereaved children, and those infected after the deemed
cut-off dates.
Thanks, Lawrence.
Now, questions to be considered.
What next?
Are we yet again going to be fed empty gestures and
left waiting for responses and action, therefore
prolonging our anxieties?  A Government minister said,
"Time is of the essence".  So that should be honoured by
a timetable of updates detailing the progress of the
implementation plans.
Another question: would it be possible to see the
final report before the press and the public?
How can we keep in touch?  The camaraderie that has
been developed has been so instrumental in the survival
of many of us.
Now, I'll finish by saying something positive.  I've
made some wonderful lifelong friends, for which I'm
eternally grateful.
I thank you, Sir Brian.  Like so many others, I have 
    38appreciated your compassionate, respectful, dignified
manner -- now it's funny, actually, that, what you've
just done, because we watch, we wait, for you to peel
back your mask and then ask your cleverly composed
questions.  Even though you don't always get answers.
I thank all the Inquiry team and support staff.
I have personally appreciated Catherine's regular Zoom
catch-up meetings, so valuable to keep in touch with
people, to hear people, to let people feel relaxed that
they can talk.
I thank Jenni and the legal teams.  I fully
appreciate how it must have been challenging and
harrowing hearing the tragic accounts of the infected
and affected.
But most importantly, I must say, I thank all my
friends and my family for the support that I've
received.
Now, I've stood here with a beating heart, somewhat
rapid, but I'd like to honour and remember those of this
community that unfortunately, through no fault of their
own, do not have beating hearts anymore.
Thank you.

 We will just look that, Stuart.  It is 0653025.  
So we can see it's a letter from Dr Evans to the 
GP.  It refers to reviewing you.  Again, it says: 
"Cannot find any evidence of haemophilia and 
I think the most likely explanation for his bleedin g 
and his joint pains is the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."
It refers to you being infected with hepatitis C 
as a consequence of treatment with blood products. 
Then it says this: 
"I will try and obtain some information about his 
previous treatment so that he may apply to the Skip ton 
Fund for compensation for his hepatitis C.  As he h as 
had treatment between 1980 and 2000 it is possible 
that he is at increased risk of new variant CJD.
However, I think the guidelines for this are changi ng 
and he may not be at risk.  Therefore I have not 
informed him this at present, but clearly if he nee ds 
any surgical procedure, then we will have to consid er 
this.  I am awaiting further clarification from the
Department of Health on this issue." 
So we can see from this, and your statement says,
that when you saw Dr Evans on this occasion, she 
didn't mention variant CJD to you.      35

 Right.  I would like to say something.  I would lik e you 
all to bear with me. 
Before this Inquiry was announced, some of you may 
have known me as the man who paints his face red at
protests, or "going red", as I call it.  I couldn't  have 
done the investigative stuff, it was just too much for 
me, that others have done, but I was told that goin g red 
helped us get press for the campaign. 
Through doing the campaign stuff, many of you have 
become very, very good friends.  Also those who hav e 
lost their fathers to Factor products.  I would lik e to 
take a little moment to talk about our group, the 
Fatherless Generation. 
Before 2017 only a handful of us knew each other,      56 but after the Panorama programme that year, more an d 
more of us connected, realising that we were not al one. 
There are now over 120 of us, and that number is st ill 
growing, who all know the lifelong pain of losing 
a parent to this scandal.  We know what it's like t o 
have to lie about how your parent died, what it's l ike 
to hear AIDS jokes, what it's like to feel that you
cannot tell anybody what happened because they'll t hink 
you're a lunatic. 
The children of dead haemophiliacs have been treate d 
appallingly.  We have always been excluded from ong oing 
support.  Even now, we get nothing.  We probably av oided 
making a scene or a fuss over this because we didn' t 
want the government to take away from the infected.
We see how the government have saved money excludin g 
the children.  The government created arguments, 
watching the infected and widows fighting about scr aps 
over who deserved what.  While all this happened, w e sat 
silently, scared to suggest that we should be 
recognised.  The dying fears of our fathers were 
confirmed. 
Many in our group have psychological trauma that ha s 
ruined their education and left them unable to work  or,
at best, they have never reached their full potenti al. 
We have all lost far more than just our parents.7 Some in our group never knew a life before the 
Contaminated Blood Scandal.  They were born into it  and 
it is all they have ever known.  For them their liv es 
were not just turned upside down one day; they were
damaged from the beginning. 
The government has never taken into account the 
family turmoil that happened, how our families were  torn 
apart.  People broke up and got divorced.  When the
government say they are supporting affected people,  what 
this really means is they are supporting the widows .  It 
is as if we don't exist. 
If your parents divorced before your dad died, then
there is no widow and the government save money, be cause 
you are excluded entirely. 
The government always talks about infected and 
affected, but when they tweak the schemes, we are 
affected, some of us our entire lives.  But no matt er 
what tweaks they make, we never get anything.  It i s the 
same for the parents who lost children as well.  
But we must always remember that the worst affected
by this scandal are dead.  Schemes will not help th e 
dead.  Schemes have been used to play the haemophil ia 
community against each other, and no scheme will ev er 
give these people independence. 
We want the government to set up a full compensatio n8 panel like in Ireland.  It is often said by victims  and 
their families that the government will wait until 
everybody is dead before paying compensation so tha t it 
will be cheaper.  In the Republic of Ireland the 
compensation panel was set up in a way that the 
compensation provided to a bereaved family was paid  to 
the infected person as if they were still alive.  T he 
full claim did not die with that infected person.  This 
was because if this was not the case, then the 
government would have saved money by waiting for so  many 
people to die before doing something. 
We don't know yet if compensation will ever be paid , 
but if it is, this must be something that happens h ere 
too.  It might be exceptional in law, but I think w e can 
all agree that this is an exceptional event in the very 
worst of ways. 
I also want to talk about the pharmaceutical 
companies.  As well as BPL, some of the pharmaceuti cal 
companies that sent infected Factor products here a re 
Bayer, Baxter and Revlon Healthcare.  Unfortunately  in 
this country the press are too scared to mention th e 
names of pharma for fear that they will get sued.  We 
can't name the killers of our parents.  People are told 
just not to mention the pharmaceutical companies' n ames 
in interviews, and if they do, the press just cut i t9 out. 
At the opening hearings last September, the Inquiry
said it had asked five pharmaceutical companies for
documents, but they did not name those companies.  The 
government also never names those companies, such a s 
Bayer, Baxter, Revlon Healthcare, when they speak a bout 
this.  The silence on this must end and we must onc e and 
for all be able to name our parents' killers. 
On top of the confused press reports that often sho w 
bags of blood instead of Factor products, this is p art 
of the reason why what has happened to the haemophi lia 
community is so poorly understood by the general pu blic. 
Revlon now distances itself from the scandal becaus e 
it sold off Revlon Healthcare in the mid 1980s afte r 
people began to be told about HIV.  Revlon was not 
always just a cosmetics company.  Revlon Healthcare 's 
company Armour supplied Factor products to this cou ntry 
which killed people with hepatitis and AIDS.  It is  now
time for those companies to at least acknowledge wh at 
happened.  They need to stop hiding us from their 
history. 
As guilty as the Department of Health is, at least 
they accept this happened.  The same cannot be said  for 
companies like Revlon.  They cannot get away with t his 
anymore.0 Before I say the next bit, I would like to thank De s 
and Danny at Collins Solicitors and all of the peop le 
that work for Collins.  You have been amazing.  You
really have.  We can't thank you enough for believi ng in 
us.  But I also it would not thank our counsel, Bri an 
Cummings, and Stephen Snowden.  I want to thank the m for 
their Inquiry work but also the group legal action which 
was placed at the court one week before this Inquir y was 
announced. 
There is something in one of the group legal action
hearings last year that people might not know about , and 
I want to say something about that today.  A lot of
people here, including myself, have a very low opin ion 
of Kenneth Clarke from when he was Health Minister,  and 
we want him to give oral evidence.  Part of this is  that 
in 1983 Kenneth Clarke said there was no conclusive
evidence that AIDS is transmitted by blood products . 
Obviously this is not true.  The term "conclusive 
evidence" was used by the government a lot in the 1 980s 
about AIDS.  Last year, at one of the legal action 
hearings, Justice Martin Spencer said that the use of 
words like "conclusive evidence" is somewhat 
disingenuous if they had evidence on the balance of
probability that there was such a link. 
I think Kenneth Clarke needs to give us answers, an d1 just for the record, there is no way this man shoul d 
ever be Prime Minister; he should be in prison. 
We are all obviously pleased that this Inquiry is 
happening, but there is an unfairness that puts us all 
at a disadvantage.  Pharmaceutical companies have 
billions of dollars.  The government have open acce ss to 
taxpayer money, and the health services.  But we ha ve to 
apply for everything.  We are not allowed legal fun ding 
for the investigation into this Inquiry, and this s eems 
very unfair.  We know that victims in the Grenfell 
Inquiry have had the same problem.  I think this ne eds 
to change so that we can independently review the 
Inquiry reports, because those who do have the mone y and 
the power will. 
We are not on an equal footing with government, 
health services or pharmaceuticals in this Inquiry.   We 
need to remember that the government and civil serv ice 
never wanted this Inquiry.  In November 2016,
Nicola Blackwood, who was the Health Minister, said  in 
the House of Commons:
"The Prime Minister has been very clear that we do 
not believe a public inquiry would provide further 
information." 
I think we can all agree from the hearings so far 
that she was not correct, but we are used to minist ers2 who deny us justice.
In 1999, Baroness Hayman said a public inquiry was 
not the way forward.  In 2000 John Denham said:
"All the information is in the public domain and 
I do not believe that anyone's interests would be s erved 
by a public inquiry." 
In 2001 Lord Hunt of Kings Heath said:
"There would be nothing to be gained from a public 
inquiry." 
In 2002, Dr Filkin said:
"I do not believe that there is benefit to anyone 
from a public inquiry." 
In 2003, Lord Warner said: 
"The government do not accept that any wrongful 
practices were employed and we do not consider that
a public inquiry is justified." 
In 2004, Lord Warner also said:
"Wrongful practices have not been employed.  We do 
not believe that this public inquiry is justified."
In 2006, Caroline Flint said:
"We do not consider a public inquiry is justified."  
Sorry, bear with me ...

  For the past 28 years and who knows how man y 
more, not a day has gone by that I haven't worried about 
my dad.  From age 11, when I would cry myself to sl eep,
to the present day, when sleep becomes a luxury, th e 
main thing which preoccupies my mind is him : my dad , my 10 
hero, my world. 
I watched my successful father lose his business du e 
to ill-health and scrape for every penny he and my mum 
could find just to keep our family going.  I watche d him 
go in and come out of hospital on too many occasion s and 
was always wondering if this is it.  Is this the da y we 
lose him?  And this is still with me today.  The 
wondering, the fear, the panic of: is this it now? 
As I've grown older and witnessed more and more 
suffering, it has affected my mental health too.  I  have 
to take antidepressants for help with depression an d 
anxiety, and I'm currently signed off work as a res ult 
of this.  At no point have I ever been offered any form 
of help with this by way of counselling and such fr om 
any organisation.  There needs to be something in p lace 
for the affected and infected to be given help, a p lace 
where those like me can call upon an expert who kno ws 
our stories and is available to support us whenever  we 
need it.
What we need to understand too is that this scandal
has gone beyond second generation but now to third 
generation.  My 13-year-old eldest daughter has als o 
been profoundly affected by this travesty.  She fin ds it 
very difficult to come to terms with her grandad's 
illness.  Leading on to very recent events, due to the  11 
inquiry, I found it necessary to tell my 11-year-ol d 
daughter about her grandfather and what has led to this 
inquiry.  Talk about out of the mouths of babes.  Wh en 
I had finished telling her of the whys and wherefor es of 
this tragedy, she wiped away her tears and said, "W ill 
someone go to prison for this?"
To lose a loved one is the hardest thing anybody 
will ever go through.  However, to have a father go ing 
through incredible illness with only one end in sig ht,
I cannot help but feel like we're living a life 
sentence.  The never-ending rollercoaster of emotio nal 
and psychological torture of his ups and downs that  we 
are still going through today is debilitating, and the 
feelings of uncertainty anguish and fear for a man who 
is loved so extremely is always at the forefront of  my 
mind.
Having my dad still with us comes with another set 
emotions too, guilt being one.  Crazy as it sounds,
I feel guilty that I still have my dad here with us  when 
I know that the vast majority within our community do 
not.  I am part of a group who have been named the 
fatherless generation, and that alone makes me feel
torn.  I have a sense of belonging to the group, wi th 
all their support and camaraderie, but I also feel that 
I'm intruding as, yes, Dad is still here on this ea rth.  12 
However, I lost my dad 28 years ago.  He is not the
same man he would've been without having been infecte d.
I see a man who struggles daily with the most every day 
physical tasks.  I see a man who has put on an act of, 
"Everything's okay", when he is suffering 
psychologically.  I see a man who is the shadow of a dad 
I once had.
This life we've been given has torn my family apart . 
We have gone through things no normal family ever w ould 
or should.  I want the government and the pharmaceu tical 
companies responsible for this nightmare to be held  to 
account.  We all need to know why on earth this was  ever 
allowed to happen, and I want them punished.  Both the 
infected and affected need closure, and we need a f ull 
compensation scheme in line with or similar to the 
Republic of Ireland. 
I have campaigned alongside my dad for justice for 
all those infected haemophiliacs and affected famil ies 
and have seen him diminish from a man with hunger f or 
answers, and a passion for the cause, to a man who is 
weary and losing all hope.
We have such limited time now that the importance 
and urgency of finding answers and finally having o ur 
day could not be more paramount.

 Again, we have two further letters that 
Professor Tuddenham wrote on your behalf.  I just w ant 
to have a look at those.  1756008, please.  It's 
a letter to whom it may concern, but it was for you r 
applications.
He notes in the middle of the first paragraph that:  
"A contentious point arises over the unfortunate 
fact that she was never tested for liver function d uring 
the early period that she was so infected and only 
subsequently much later tested and found to have cl eared 
the infection."
He refers to a letter that you'd written summarisin g 
your situation, and endorsed everything in that let ter, 
and he then closes his letter saying this: 
"I personally think that if she's refused any 
compensation on a highly restricted interpretation of 
the rules governing the disbursement of the fund th en 
that manifestly is unfair." 
And a subsequent letter from him, in October 2010, 
1756014, please.  He opens the letter saying this: 
"Concerning the evident fact that Mrs Nicola Jones 
was infected with hepatitis C through infusion of N HS  39 
Factor VIII concentrate at the time of her tonsille ctomy 
in 1980.  These comments are based on records in ca se 
notes held at the Katherine Dormandy Haemophilia Ce ntre. 
I believe that copies of these case notes are avail able 
to the panel, who are trying their best not to awar d 
what she is obviously due, namely compensation for 
having been infected by hepatitis C and having deve loped 
a degree of chronicity." 
He then goes on to set out your history.
Despite those letters from Professor Tuddenham, you
did not receive any support from the Skipton Fund.

--Result #214--
 Yes.  I think as well, that is true what you're s aying, 
I felt that my mum wasn't in a stable place to go 
forward with any trying to get compensation or to - - 
even medical negligence, if you like.  I think she felt 
that there was no bringing him back, you know, and every 
time it was mentioned -- I remember even at the tim e he 22 
died, we were almost fobbed off, you know.  We'd be en 
called into the hospital to go and see him, just 
a few minutes.  By the time we got there -- it wasn 't 
a long journey, but by the time we got there, he ha d 
died, and, you know, even then I think someone came  in 
and asked if, you know, they could do a postmortem and 
all this, that and the other for research purposes on 
his liver, and my mum was just in pieces, and it wa s 
a bit insensitive to say the least.
And it just -- you know, she -- I don't think she 
was in a fit state to go forward with going for 
compensation, and we felt -- even then, I think at that 
point in time my mum said something about being ser um 
hepatitis, and they said, "Oh, well, it could've be en 
a virus or something."  So it was almost being fobb ed 
off even at that point.

  Sir Brian, like my brother I'd li ke to 
thank you so much.  I've had the pleasure of speaki ng to 
you, you're very compassionate and a gentleman and 
I really appreciate you giving us this opportunity to 
speak. 
I am just one of the many who have been affected by
this disgraceful blood stain on this great country' s 
history.  But what happened to me and others like m e 
should never have been.  For decades we have been l et 
down by government after government, and told what 
happened to us was unfortunate, but never any blame
really accepted.
As a child I watched young men die knowing I was th e 
same and wondering when it would be my turn.  Befor e 
I was 30 I had lost a wife, a home, a job and my 
dignity.  But instead of being told why I was like this,
I was left to feel it was all my fault and I was 
a failure.  I struggled with the guilt of still bei ng 
alive when so many I knew died, and I felt that oth ers 
who had died deserved a life I had failed so misera bly 
in.  So much so that I tried to take my own life on  more 
than one occasion, coming very close more than once .     135 But I was blessed and, against odds, I found love 
once again where I met, like my brother, love of my
life -- I think we'll go for points - and was bless ed 
with two beautiful children.  And although we strug gled 
with money, due to my inability to work, we were bl essed 
with love and a true feeling of what a family shoul d be.
So many young people have died not having the gift 
of finding love and having a family who should have , so 
for this is am truly grateful.
I am telling you my story as much for those who 
can't as myself, and believe in doing so I am honou ring 
their memory.  I still feel guilt for being alive, 
I can't help it.
Every night, when I lie in bed, I wonder how much 
time I have left and have a recurring nightmare of lying 
on my deathbed saying goodbye to my wife and kids.
I wake up every morning in pain, both mentally and 
physically, and struggle to be the man I want to be .
I have struggled with intimacy because I feel I am
a danger to those I love; my medical files make sur e of 
that with the biohazard warnings.  The truth is we were 
lied to, and information we were entitled to know a bout 
our own bodies was withheld by those who were meant  to 
protect us.  People talk about proof of wrongdoing:  we,
and those who are not here, are the proof.     136 How can so many tell the same story without it bein g 
true?  We were let down, and still are, by the NHS and 
the governments that are meant to serve us.  In the  past 
months I have witnessed true heroism by the affecte d, 
their parents, spouses and children who have had th e 
courage to tell their stories no matter how painful .
You are all heroes and have acted with a dignity an d 
grace that shames those who wish to silence us.
But you will never silence us, for once we are all 
gone, those who love us will take up the fight unti l 
justice is served.
You know who you are, and I pray, come the day of 
your judgment by our Lord, you finally feel the pai n you 
have caused.  You may have used the system to evade
justice, but you can't avoid your own fate.
We have been left to struggle financially for 
decades and have never been compensated for the los s of 
earnings and ability to own a home that we have had
taken from us, even though those who did this have 
enjoyed high paid careers and homes of their choosi ng.
So for my final comment, I wish to stand up for 
those who cannot and address those who are here 
representing the government.
We are never going to give up, and I shall 
personally fight for justice until my dying breath.     137 Those of us who are still alive deserve to live out  the 
rest of our lives comfortably and with dignity, as do 
those left behind to pick up the pieces of a broken
life.  I implore you to tell the government that th e 
time has come to admit fault and give us the 
compensation we deserve, now, just as so many other
countries such as Ireland have and go some way to 
putting things right.  Don't tell us there is no mo ney, 
because we pay billions in foreign aid because it i s the 
right thing to do, so surely this is the right thin g to 
do?  It is, after all, our money, and all the taxpa yers'
of this country. 
I stand on the shoulders of the dead and it breaks 
my heart every day.  I thank you all for listening to 
me.
Thank you, Sir Brian.
(...Applause...)

 Well, I wanted to know what the Haemophilia Society 's 
view about litigation was.  Because a lot of cases 
were being brought which had little chance of succe ss, 
because to succeed, they would have had to prove 
individual negligence, and the patients in question
had not been managed in an unusual way.  There were
patients who had severe haemophilia but were,
nevertheless, claiming that they should have been 
treated with DDAVP, though they would not have 
responded to that. 
Now, I had every sympathy with their desire to be 
compensated, because they had clearly been damaged by 
their treatment.  And my feeling at that time was t hat 
surely this was a classical example of a situation where 
there should be some form of no-fault compensation 
scheme.  But, in fact, I was told that whilst there  was 
all this litigation going on in the background, no such  
136 scheme would be put together. 
So, you know, a lot of the litigation that was goin g 
on at that point seemed unlikely to succeed.  There  was 
more and more of it.  We then had the campaign wher e 
a whole series of patients from around the country 
reported the Centre Directors to the General Medica l 
Council, claiming various acts of professional 
misconduct, which were, as far as I knew, and certa inly 
in relation to the two complainants against me, 
completely false. 
And, you know, I was very sympathetic towards 
a campaign for compensation, but that was hardly 
calculated to get me on site.  How would you feel i f 
someone made a complaint to the Bar Council about y ou, 
for example?
So -- and I had gained the impression that elements
in the Haemophilia Society were encouraging this.  It 
was a slightly circular problem, though, because wh en 
I was a little bit more senior, a little bit furthe r on, 
and was talking to the Department of Health, what t hey 
told me was, so long as there was litigation going on in 
the background, they couldn't put any scheme into p lace, 
because it would influence the outcome of the 
litigation. 
And I think a lot of my colleagues and I felt as if 
 we were slightly caught in the crossfire, because w e 
were the closest target for the patients' ire, they
blamed their medical attendants for their suffering , and 
we were not in any position to help with financial 
compensation.  It was really the Department of Heal th 
that they needed to approach.  But we were the only
outlet, and they sought to increase the profile of their 
campaign by suing us all and reporting us to the 
General Medical Council.

--Result #217--
   Excuse me, can you just help and 
tell me who it was that you spoke to at the Departm ent 
of Health who suggested that having a form of 
compensation scheme would in some way influence the
outcome of the -- of a court case?  In other words,
I think the suggestion is it might influence a judg e 
in favour of or against the case. 

--Result #218--
 Yes, I do.  If it's okay with you if I can read. 
There's actually three points that I want.
First, I want to speak about the infected and 
affected, then with reference to the NHS staff, and      42 finally to the Inquiry team yourselves. 
The first thing I would like to say is that the 
infected and affected are experts in understanding the 
impact of NHS policies.  They know the NHS truth an d 
how they truthfully operate.  Our knowledge is vast
and it should be valued.  The Scottish Government i n 
2020 in their vision for health and care strategy 
stated that by 2020 every person in Scotland is giv en 
the best standard of care with the patient at the 
centre of all decisions. 
When is our community going to see this 
person-centred care?
With regard to the NHS staff, I would like to 
see teaching in medical schools and the ongoing 
training in hospitals for consultants.  It must 
change.  I want change.  Doctors have no God-given 
right to hold all the power.  These last 30 years 
since I was infected were made much worse by the ab use 
of power by doctors and nursing staff when I was at  my 
most vulnerable and my weakest state.
If I can turn to the Inquiry team, I wish to 
raise two points with you, Sir Brian, and your team . 
Firstly, I would like you to consider how you inten d 
to record silence in testimonies.  When the depth o f 
suffering is so great that all language fails and w hat3 we recognise is that the pause is as valuable in 
conveying the trauma as the spoken word.  This is v ery 
important for future researchers who will study the
final report in generations to come. 
My second point is how will the Inquiry team 
quantify the loss of potential.  How can you,
Sir Brian, and your team really establish the scale  of 
loss for the infected and affected that you are so 
keen to put first. 
To demonstrate what I mean, I was infected when 
I was 29 years of age and most people here know wha t 
stage they were at in their careers at 29.  I want to 
give you two examples.  At 29 years of age John Maj or 
with no university education and working for Standa rd 
Chartered would take another eight years to become 
a Government minister.  Nicola Sturgeon at 29 was 
a young solicitor.  What compensation would they be
seeking today if they had been infected at 29 years  of 
age and their political ambitions had been destroye d. 
I hope these examples focus the Inquiry team's and the 
public's minds on what it truly means to lose your 
career, your health and your financial security. 
Thank you very much. 

--Result #219--
 I want to then move to the topic of compensation in
relation to HCV and The Haemophilia Society's 
campaign.  Could we have, please, on screen 
SKIP0000031_082. 
We can see this is a document, "Report of the 
Hepatitis C Working Party to The Haemophilia Societ y,
June 2002".  If we go to page 4, please, Soumik, we
can see there in paragraph 1 identified the members hip 
of the working party, which included yourself,
Professor Preston, Dr Makris, and Karin Pappenheim  
151 from The Haemophilia Society, as well as others.
Dr Giangrande, I'm not going to ask you about 
the detail of the recommendations because we have t he 
report, but could you just outline briefly how this
working party came about and what the purpose of 
reporting was? 

--Result #220--
 The party was convened by The Haemophilia Society.  So 
I don't know the background to that.  We were just 
invited and naturally all agreed. 
The background was to try and get financial 
assistance for people who had been affected by 
hepatitis C.  Note, not just the patients but also 
various families.  It was partly as a consequence o f 
the famous agreement whereby people signed away rig hts 
for compensation in relation to the payment made fo r 
HIV.  And the purpose of this which took -- it was 
convened in, I think, September of 2001; we reporte d 
in June of 2002 -- was basically to come up with 
a simple costed measure.  And we did this looking a t 
systems that operated in other countries and seized
upon the Canadian model which seemed a particularly
good one. 
We also sent out questionnaires on behalf of The 
Haemophilia Society to our patients in Oxford.  We 
sent out 150 from Oxford, and also our colleagues i n  
152 Sheffield sent out a similar questionnaire.  How ha d 
hepatitis C affected them in their lives, in terms of 
their working lives?  Could they get mortgages, lif e 
insurance, that sort of thing?  Had it affected the ir 
income? 
Then we came up with a five-stage plan which 
offered compensation, or assistance shall we say,
according to the level of patients being affected. 
I think the Skipton Fund in the end came up with --
and, by the way, after this report launched, we had
a meeting in the House of Commons with Hazel Blears ,
the then health secretary, and there was another MP
there.  And this led to various discussions which, in 
the end, led to the Skipton Fund being set up with 
a simpler model, a two-stage system, but the money was 
pretty similar. 
The costing worked out at, going from memory,
£52.6 million for five successive years.  This mode l 
proposed one thing which has still not been achieve d,
and that is coming back to something I was saying i n 
the morning session.  Level 1 offered compensation or 
assistance of £7,500 to people who had been exposed  to 
HCV but didn't have persistent infection.  That is,
they'd cleared it spontaneously.  The reason for th at 
was we felt that being told you had hepatitis C, 
 because in the early days, without the PCR tests, w e 
couldn't say, "Look, you've cleared it spontaneousl y." 
We thought that generated a lot of anxiety and worr y 
which deserved to be rewarded. 
The second thing I would want to pick up on from 
this report is that we clearly said that this money
should also be available to the relatives of the 
deceased.  And I'm sorry to say that in the initial
incarnation of the Skipton Fund, that did not happe n.
Although, I'm pleased to say that some years later an 
adjustment was duly made. 
But that's the sort of background, and I thought 
it was a good report.  I think it had some influenc e.

--Result #221--
 Then you identify what appear to be: 
"Some clear differences of opinion between our 
group and that which met on October 14."
We'll just look at the three points that you 
were there making.  The first is payment to patient s 
who had simply tested positive for HCV antibody, ev en 
if they subsequently cleared this.  And you say: 
"It may be difficult for you to appreciate the 
tremendous anxiety that was generated in the early 
1990s when patients were tested and informed of the ir 
results for hepatitis C.  People with haemophilia w ere 
among the first cohorts to be investigated and test ed 
systematically, and this group of patients was 
particularly mindful of problems related to AIDS on ly 
a few years beforehand." 
Then if we go over the page, please, you say: 
"We think it grossly unfair that patients 
co-infected with HCV and HIV should not receive 
additional compensation." 
You go on to talk about that.  And then 3:
"Equally, we feel it grossly unfair that 
compensation should not be offered to the relatives  of 
those who died from hepatitis."  
155 And then you offer to discuss the points with 
the person to whom you are addressing it. 
Can you recall whether you had any further 
discussions with the Department of Health on these 
points? 

--Result #222--
 I want to ask you next on a different topic but 
looking also at a set of UKHCDO minutes from 1989, so 
could we have HCDO0000015_035 please, Soumik.  So t his 
is a meeting of Haemophilia Centre Directors in 
October 1989 and, again, we can see that you're in 
attendance, and then if we go please to page 5, 
Soumik, halfway down the page under the heading 
"Litigation", there begins a fairly lengthy discuss ion 
about litigation.  Sorry, I should have drawn your 
attention to the list of attendees.  Dr Rejman from
the Department of Health and a representative of th e 
firm of solicitors, Cole & Cole, were also in 
attendance.  We can see here there's a report from 
Dr Jones.  In the second paragraph, it says: 
"Dr Jones highlighted the damage being done to 
the doctor/patient relationship as the case dragged
on ..." 
Then we have a Mrs Simpson, partner in the firm 
of Cole & Cole, giving an outline of the progress o f 
the defence to the patients' Statement of Claim.  T hen 
if we go over the page, we can see she provides 
various details about who's involved, about the 
progress of the litigation.                                         
 If we can look at the bottom half of the page, 
Soumik, a little closer, you'll see that long 
paragraph there talks about a questionnaire being 
produced and who the lawyers were involved, and the n 
that long paragraph ends with this: 
"Haemophilia Centre Directors were not 
defendants and the lawyers would like the Directors  to 
co-operate fully and give as much help as possible. " 
Then in the next paragraph there's a question 
about individual directors and the solicitor 
emphasised that the Health Authorities were the 
defendants and not the directors.  Then if we go ov er 
the page please, and we zoom in on the first half o f 
that long paragraph in the middle of the page pleas e, 
Soumik, we can see Dr Chisholm asks about the cost to 
patients and if directors could do anything to help
patients.  Mrs Simpson talks about the defence lawy ers 
looking to strike out the claim, and then there's 
a long paragraph where Dr Rejman, representing the 
Department of Health, gives the Government's 
perspective: 
"... no case for an out of court settlement ... 
compensation must be sought through the courts", 
et cetera, et cetera. 
Now, it would appear from this discussion that  
134 directors were, to some extent at least, being aske d 
to assist in the defence of the litigation.  They w ere 
certainly being given a fairly detailed account of the 
defendants', including the Government's, response. 
Can you recall whether at the time that struck you as 
odd or concerning that directors were being drawn i nto 
the litigation for the defendants in this way?

--Result #223--
 Again, on a new topic, you -- in relation to the Z8
clinical trials in, I think, 1987 onwards, you were
not prepared to have your patients involved in 
clinical trials of PFC products at that stage, unle ss 
compensation was put in place for adverse events; i s 
that correct? 

--Result #224--
 I am going to ask now that we look at the letter yo u 
wrote to Mr Clarke and use that, as it were, as the
springboard for my final questions for you. 
LOTH0000069_022, please, Soumik.  We can see it's 
November 1989, to Kenneth Clarke, and you've said t his: 
"I know you are aware of the great tragedy that has
befallen 1,200 haemophiliacs in the UK who have bec ome 
infected by HIV." 
You refer then to the Macfarlane Trust and the 
payment and say: 
"Whilst this is clearly of some benefit to them it 
is a long way short of what might be considered 
a reasonable settlement as compensation.  
"The campaign to obtain no fault compensation for 
these unfortunate individuals will continue.  It is 
147 clear it has received a great deal of support ..."
Then you say: 
"It would greatly enhance the standing of the 
Government if it could be seen to be caring for the
patients.
"I have been approached by your Department to ask i f 
I would be prepared to act as an Expert Witness in the 
forthcoming litigation.  I am therefore very famili ar 
with much of the background to the HIV problem and know 
that such litigation will be potentially very damag ing 
damaging.  
"I very strongly urge you to have discussions with 
the Haemophilia Society and The Macfarlane Trust to  try 
and devise a system of reasonable compensation, aft er 
all many European countries have already gone along  this 
path." 
I wanted to ask you, first of all, arising from 
this, about what you say about litigation being 
potentially very damaging.  Not going to put on the
screen yet other further UKHCDO minutes, but there are 
number of UKHCDO meetings at this time, at which th ere 
is a substantial discussion about litigation and th ere 
was the formation of a litigation group, I think, o n 
which you were included: you, Dr Jones Dr Rizza, an d 
Dr Savidge.  
148 Did the work on litigation which, first of all, the
UKHCDO as an organisation decided to undertake, dis tract 
or divert that organisation and its members from th e 
core purpose of improving the treatment of haemophi lia 
patients, do you think? 

--Result #225--
   When was it that you first raised 
the question of compensation being paid on a no-fau lt 
basis, do you recall?  Was it this letter to 
Ken Clarke or not? 

--Result #226--
   I think Dr Kazarian makes a really 
important point there.  Just to build on it slightl y 
one of the problems we have in our system is that w e 
have a system of negligence based on fault.  So, gi ven 
that system and that faults need to be proved, ther e 
is also an incentive to keep things quiet because t he 
potential of a negligence suit hangs like the Sword  of 
Damocles.  Other systems, such as New Zealand, for 
example, there is a no-fault compensation system,
which tries to move beyond this and put even more 
emphasis on openness and transparency and apologies
and redress.

Good morning
, 
sir.  
A
 number of people have
indicated that they are looking forward to these closing
submissions
.  
All I can say is I pray I don't let you
down
.
Let me make three basic opening points.  Treatment
without consent was never acceptable.  Treatment without
consent is no excuse for substandard care.  Those who
treat without consent and cause harm should be hauled up
before the criminal courts.
Sir
, 
as you are aware my name is Sam 
Stein
 KC and
,
with Ms Milligan, instructed by Milners Solicitors
,
I appear on behalf of 23 of my clients
.  
All of them are
either infected or affected and victims of this
disaster
.
We thank you, sir
, 
and the Inquiry team for its
care
, 
the respect with which all parties have been dealt
with
, 
and the depth of this investigation.  The hard
work of the entire Inquiry team, its support services
and structures have made this Inquiry as accessible as
possible and as positive 
an
 experience as it could be in
 
2
the circumstances.
Sir, 
we also thank you and the Inquiry for the clear
thinking and organisational skills which meant that we
heard from the victims of the scandal first and returned
to victims periodically throughout.
The evidence from the infected and affected
 -- 
and
please understand, I understand myself how clumsy and
objectifying those words 
"
infected
"
 and 
"
affected
"
are
 -- 
the evidence from those people have given this
Inquiry the bedrock of evidence that it needed in order
to understand what happened as against the evidence from
the clinicians, the bureaucrats and politicians.
It should be noted, sir, that the Penrose Inquiry
only heard from 
a
 limited number of those infected and
affected
.
After Penros
e, 
the infected and affected community
were left devastated by the Penrose Report.  The
community thought that Penrose was the last shot at
truth and meaningful reparations
, 
and I know that some
people wanted to give up.  
Mark Stewart, 
who
m
I represent
, 
thought about taking his own life.
The evidence and the submissions in this
, 
the
Infected Blood Inquiry
, 
finishes today.  It will
, 
I am
sure
, 
take time for everyone to cope with the loss of
the constant engagement and consideration of the
 
3
evidence.  This may feel a little like bereavement but
this community is used to that.
Next
, 
for 
a
 moment I want to single out for praise
the Inquiry legal team, led so ably by Ms Richards KC.
We thank them for the four years of weeks away from home
and the evenings and sometimes the nights worked through
to get this right.  We recognise that this has not been
a
 marathon for the Inquiry legal team
; 
instead
, 
this has
been 
a
 series of ultramarathons
, 
run towards what must
have seemed at first 
to be 
a
 very dim light at the end
of 
a
 very long tunnel
.
Now let me turn to my own small but mighty client
group we have had the great pleasure of representing
before this Inquiry
.  
We, their legal team
, 
have
 
learnt
everything from listening to you, learning about what
was done to you and what you 
did
 as a result.
Our clients have been infected, affected and killed
by the scandal.  We remember in this regard the loss of
Peter Mossman
, 
aka Mossy
, 
an
 infected haemophiliac and
great campaigner who died after developing pneumonia and
was buried 
a
 year 
ago
 today on February 3rd
, 
2022.  His
son Gareth has said to the press
, "
My father was
consumed by his need to get justice and battle for this
Inquiry for so long
", 
and it makes me feel emotional 
to
think 
that the Inquiry is coming to 
an
 end on the
 
4
anniversary of his funeral.
Gareth went 
on
 to say
, "
It is massively upsetting
that he is not 
here
 
to
 see it
.
"
Our clients' lives have been devastated and derailed
by their and their loved ones
'
 exposure to infected
blood products.  They have truly lived through the worst
of time
s: 
the stigma, the fear, the desperate day
-
to
-
day
ill health, the 
pain, the bain frog -- the bain frog! --
the 
brain fog and continual sleep deprivation
.
Those infected and 
their
 families have been told
that they won't survive their infections many 
a
 time
.
Mark Ward told us doctors told him on 
a
 number of
occasions that he is going to die, yet instead he
survives and continues his astonishing campaign to
spread the world about healthy blood products to the
world
.
Some of our clients are women who supported their
partners through terminal illness
, 
and of those
, 
few
gave any thought at any time
 -- 
and some were in turn
infected themselves.  One of our clients, the terrific
Colette 
Wintle has had to achieve recognition of her
very own identity as 
a
 female haemophiliac
, 
ignored and
assigned to 
a
 bin of heavy women's problems or dismissed
as 
a
 carrier.
Some of our clients had been misdiagnosed as
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  5
haemophiliacs and then mistreated as such
, 
cruelly
infected through blood products which they never
required.  It would be wrong of me not to record that
our misdiagnosed clients remain of the view that they
have at times felt ignored by this Inquiry as it has not
been about mistakes made in their treatment but of
course how that treatment came to bear on those who
received it.
Sir, 
we have
 -- 
you may remember at the very
beginning of the Inquiry
 
my misdiagnosed clients wore
a
 T-shirt
.  
I have one here.  
Sir, whilst 
the Inquiry
is
, of course, 
welcome to have it, I note 
that 
it is
probably more me size
d
, 
an 
XXL
, than 
anyone else.
And
,
 of course
,
 many of our clients are campaigners
,
who have fought and fought and fought for justice and
truth.  If ignored
, 
they knocked on another door.  Like
great fighters
, 
if ever knocked down they got straight
back up.  They never stopped.  And without them
 -- 
and
this needs recognition
 -- 
this Inquiry would never have
happened
, 
and the government line would have prevailed.
All of our clients are passionate, unrelenting and
angry
, 
but this is 
a
 righteous anger
, 
sir.  This is the
righteous anger of the ignored, the sidelined and the
discriminated.  We don't apologise for our clients'
visceral anger.  We don't apologise for their desire for
 
6
truth and for proper compensation for the damage done to
them.
Instead, let me be pinpoint clear
.  
They are right
to be angry and they are right to demand compensation,
right to demand change
 
and right to demand restitution.
It has been 
a
 privilege to represent all of our
clients, work with them and for them
, 
and it is
an
 honour to be trusted with the responsibility of --
although rather nervously -- with the responsibility of
standing up here on their behalf.
I apologise sincerely to them for sometimes not
always understanding at first or getting the point only
slowly at times.  But I hope we got there in the end.
I would also
,
 of course
,
 like to thank my juniors,
Alan 
Barker from Nexus Chambers for his hard work in 
the
early part of 
this Inquiry
, 
and 
then more
 recently 
the
great 
Scarlett Milligan 
of my own wonderful chambers,
39
 
Essex.  Myself and my 
brilliant but 
long
-
suffering
solicitor
.  
I emphasise suffering
, 
from me 
that
 
is
.
Mr Harrison
 -- 
who sits on my right
, 
from the 
great
Leeds firm, 
Milners Solicitors
 -- 
and I have had many
a
 lively discussion over the
se 
last four years.  He has
my enduring thanks.
Ben
, 
we made it
.
In making these submissions
, 
let me describe the
 
7
structure of what we have to say.  First of all, I will
be dealing with the DHSC
, 
Department of Health
 -- 
I will
probably refer to it as Department of Health
 -- 
though
that will be the first chapter
; 
then I will move on to
consent
; 
risk
; 
other medical choices
; 
experimentation
and
, 
sir
, 
at that juncture
, 
with your permission
, 
I will
break.  After the break then returning with licensing
;
what should have happened
; 
campaigners, recommendations
;
and the way forward.
I have to say
, 
sir
, 
I am slightly conscious that
I could have come up with some snappier chapter
headings.  Let me deal
, 
first of
 
all
, 
with the
Department of Health.
We
, 
like others
 
I
 
am sure
, 
awaited with interest the
oral submissions to be made on behalf of the Department
of Health by Ms Grey KC
, 
to see after all of this time
and after hearing all of this evidence how their apology
would be shaped after their opening remarks on
28 September 2018.
When speaking on behalf of the Department of Health
and Social Care in England and its predecessor
, 
Ms Grey
KC said things happened that should not have happened
and that things went wrong.  Now
, 
sir
, 
as you will be
aware
, 
in the Department of Health, 
the 
DHSC's written
submissions
, 
paragraph 1.7
, 
they refer to their
 
8
unreserved apology saying
, 
as they do there
, 
nothing in
those written submissions should be seen as changing
this.
Unfortunately
, 
what will we got from Ms Grey on
18 January was
 "
It
'
s uniquely your role to make those
find
ings
", 
referring to you
, 
sir.  Ms Grey went on to
say this "and we might have remained silent and made no
submissions
 but 
instead we have gathered together the
perspectives of those involved at the time".
Really?  Was it really 
a
 choice for the Department
of Health that they thought that they might have
remained silent and made no submissions?  After hearing
the submissions from Ms Grey
, 
I reached for the
dictionary to look up the word 
"
candour
", 
just wanting
to check my own often inadequate understanding of common
words and
, 
sir
, 
as you no doubt know
, 
it means of
quality of 
being
 honest and straightforward in attitude
and speech
.
May I compliment Ms Grey as 
an
 advocate for the high
standard of her delivery of her clients
', 
the Department
of Health's
, 
submissions but sadly deprecate her
clients' instructions to her.
Those instructions seem to be that it is the
Department of Health's view that it is somehow
acceptable that they can hide behind the curtain as they
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  9
feel they cannot be compelled to state 
a
 case
, 
let alone
provide 
a
 meaningful apology
, 
which references the facts
established and now known to us in this Inquiry
.
Well, sir, you put it to Ms Grey, what exactly can
you -- was it at that time -- referring to their opening
submissions -- "As 
a
 matter of history
, 
as opposed to
now, what was it that the Department had in 
mind
 that
you are apologising for?" 
 
We suggest that the
Department of Health's responses have shown 
an
 absolute
lack of candour and 
a 
failure by those currently in the
Department of Health to realise that apologies must mean
something.
Restorative justice require
s
 
not 
just the form of
an
 apology but the sense 
to 
those 
who are 
being
apologised to that the apology giver accepts wrongdoing.
We have 
a
 proposal for the Department of Health
 
which we
hope helps.  The very long fight for truth and justice
was never about the credib
le 
evidence that already
existed
, 
that the long-standing campaigners discovered
and discussed and preserved
, 
but it was about the
supreme effort that went into the Government
 
denials,
lies, blocking and cancelling out of campaigners and
infected and affected voices.
It was always about the refusal to look at and
address what was plain on the documents.  So we make
 
10
an
 offer to the Department of Health
: 
if you the
Government, Department of Health
, 
are struggling to work
out what you need to apologise for, then we have the
people, we have the community, we have the survivors, we
will be happy to meet with you any time, any place to
have that discussion.
But, in the light of the empty apology
, 
we suggest
and agree with my learned friend
, 
Mr Dawson KC's
submissions
 
that any reading of the Department of
Health's closing written submissions shows this in fact
it leans towards 
an
 attempt to provide 
a
 defence for the
Department of Health.  Let me look at a couple of
points
.
Firstly, the Department of Health suggests that the
years have taken their toll on recollections
,
suggest
ing
, paragraph 1.16, Department of Health written
closing, that of the effect of time on memory that
: 
"
Such limitations affect the memories of all those
heard in this Inquiry whether former ministers,
officials, doctors or patients
.  
Secondly, that again
due to the passage of time the documentary record will
be incomplete."
You will find that
, 
sir
, 
at paragraph 1.17.  Well
,
sir
, 
I doubt whether any single patient who suffered the
long consequences of their infections appreciates 
being
 
11
told that time has dimmed their recollections.
Our clients and this community has not forgotten
about what the doctors told them or didn't tell them.
They have not forgotten about the fact of their
infection
, 
or the way they learnt of their infection or
multiple infections
, 
or 
being
 told that they will not
survive
, 
or the hammer blow of letters in relation to
vCJD
, 
or the deaths.
We suggest that the community has not forgotten
those points to the Department of Health.  Let me be
clear
, 
this response from the Department of Health is
simply 
a
 demonstration of the latest Government line
used to fob off the survivors of this tragedy
.  
But
 
in
taking the latest version of the Government line
, 
the
apology at the beginning of this Inquir
y
 now appears
contrived and the lack of true acceptance of fault is
disrespectful to everyone and to Lord Morris'
s
 comment
about blood products
, 
that this is the worst treatment
disaster in the 75
-
year history of the NHS.
If nothing else
, 
this 
perpetuation 
of harm should be
considered 
an
 aggravating factor in the compensation
decisions and deliberation
.
No doubt my PI lawyer friends 
will tell me 
after my
speech how far 
that
 
is
 actually possible.
I turn now to consent.  We have witnessed in this
 
12
Inquiry the evidence given by all of the haemophiliacs
and family members and all of the witnesses about their
treatment with infected blood products.
We hope and believe that the Inquiry is likely to
accept the overwhelming preponderance of evidence from
the patients and their families which shows that
haemophiliacs were not properly informed and were not
provided with sufficient information to make 
an
 informed
choice as to whether they
 -- 
and "they" is the important
word
, 
isn't it -- as to whether they, the patient, was
prepared to take 
a
 risk
.
Consent
, 
sir
, 
is about and always has been about the
ownership of risk.  On 17 January this year
, 
we heard
the careful submissions from Mr Bragg
, 
an
 individual who
had been infected with hepatitis as a result of 
a
 blood
transfusion.  Mr Bragg
, 
because of his work
, 
referred to
the employment of risk analysis within the regulatory
world and
, 
in truth
, 
that
 
is
 what both regulation and
medical treatment is all about
.
Risk is one of, if not the main issue, to be
considered
, 
monitored and reconsidered with 
regularity
as part of 
a
 doctor's or 
indeed
 regulator's function.
The questions are always what is the 
risk
, what is
the degree of risk, changes in risk and what could be
done to ameliorate risk or avoid it entirely?
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  13
So how should risk analysis 
have been 
addressed for
haemophiliacs when considering the treatment using blood
concentrates?  First of all
, 
there needs to be
consideration of the severity of the condition of the
patient who will suffer the consequences and side
effects of any treatment
, 
and for haemophiliacs we have
broad and rather crude labels for the severity of
haemophilia.  Those are mild, moderate and severe.
Those labels are 
an
 attempt to describe the effect
on 
an
 individual of the condition, mild haemophilia 
6 to
50
 per cent
 factor level
, 
may only have minor bleeding
problems.  Moderate haemophilia 1 to 5
 per cent
 factor
level
, 
may 
bleed one time per month.  Severe
haemophilia, less than 1 per cent factor level, 
may
bleed
 one or two times per week
.
Now
, 
myself and Ms Milligan and Mr Harrison have
learnt that using these labels to describe the
individuals' lived experience of haemophilia is
a
 mistake.  Some haemophiliacs with so-called mild
haemophilia experience 
a
 much more severe response to
bleeds than might be expected from that label 
"
mild
haemophilia
"
.  So it is always about the experience of
the individual
, 
rather than any broad or brush stroke
attempt to provide 
a
 label
.
So as ever with risk, the analysis should be based
 
14
upon risk of treatment through the use of blood
concentrates or 
indeed
 any blood product for any
recipient
, 
and then analysed for that recipient
.
In short
, 
should this treatment be provided for this
patient?  The decision about treatment should therefore
be
: 
what treatments are available for this patient?
What are the benefits of each of the available
treatments for this patient?  What are the harms which
may be the result of any specific treatment?  Is there
a
 treatment which may be less effective but less risky?
Overall
, 
do the benefits outweigh the harm?  And
, 
of
course
, 
the big question, what is the decision of the
patient or the patient's guardian when properly informed
of these questions?
Now, the decision by doctors as to their view
regarding treatment and the decisions made by patients
may change 
over
 
time
; 
as knowledge changes and as
products change
, 
options change or may become more
limited.  Sometimes it is useful to think about not only
the evidence we have heard but the absence of evidence.
What evidence have we seen that reflects upon
discussions with patients about the relative severity of
their haemophilia and how that affects treatment options
or of medical advice?
What evidence have we seen or heard 
which 
shows us
 
15
that the patients had discussions with their
haematologists about the use of blood products,
commercial products, blood pools and the growth of
medical understanding?  We think back, very 
little
 
if
any at all.
Now we listened on 19 January this year to
submissions from Mr Kennedy KC
, 
on behalf of the UKHCDO
and he included the point that patients are much more
prepared to ask questions than they were in the 
'
70s
,
when there was 
a
 more paternalistic approach
, 
and that
you can also take account sir, he said, and
I paraphrase, of the patient protections from
organisations such as NICE.
So we suggest that this is and remains 
a
 submission
that could only be made by 
a
 doctors group.  Not all
patients are able to ask questions.  Not all patients
are confident enough to ask questions and not all
patients know what questions should be asked.  It also
misses the point.  In this scandal
, 
the patients
, 
if
told anything
, 
were not told the truth.
The British Medical Association publication
Professional Standards
, 
a
 statement prepared by
a
 special panel appointed by the Board of Science and
Education of the British Medical Association -- sir
,
I will give on occasions Relativity references, I don't
 
16
expect them to come up on screen, I have some points to
go on the screen
, 
and Lawrence knows them
, 
as we go
through -- the reference for that is BMAL0000082
,
page 9.
So this document from the BMA, 
Professional
Standards
 document, in the early 
'
70s
, 
discussed the
need for patients
: 
"... 
to maintain good communication and exchanging
information to patients and
, 
of course
, 
maintaining
patient confidentiality."
So have we found within this evidence over these
years any real explanation of why obtaining consent for
treatment was ignored?  
There are, 
we suggest
, 
some
pointers.  WITN3437

02
, 
page 24, Dr Winter says this:
"Relevant to this is that the nature of haematology
training changed in the mid-
'
70s.  Prior to 
this,
haematologists had been trained in laboratories.  But
under the new system haematology training required
postgraduate experience of general medicine and the
passing of the Royal College of Physicians exam.  When
viral contamination issues emerged
 [he went on to say],
some centres were managed by doctors with very limited
experience in breaking bad news."
In his evidence to the Archer Inquiry
, 
Dr Winter
made 
a
 similar point at page 90 of the transcript.  He
 

3 February 2023

said this:
"Haemophilia was really 
a
 branch of pathology prior
to that and the senior haemophilia doctors had worked in
laboratories.  They were gifted academics, they were
scientists, they were not experienced in
, 
for instance
,
dealing with very sick people."
In her interview for the Royal College of Physicians
Oral History Project
, 
Professor Lee said of
researchers
 -- 
she spoke in this way about researchers:
"You would be wasted on medicine
", she said.
"
Well
, 
tell me more about that
", 
she was asked
.
"I think that people who did pure science and
particularly at that time biochemistry was pretty new
science, regarded medicine as rather 
a
 simpler option
really, 
a
 less scientific option."
Reference to that is MACK0002586.
So there may have been 
a
 tension in haematology
between those of 
a
 more scientific background and those
trained primarily as physicians.  Part of this issue may
be that haematologists came from 
a
 pathology background,
meaning that they did not come from 
a
 patient treating
background.
Such attention could and might explain some of the
differences in treatments administered by
haematologists.  Dr Dormandy at the Royal Free 
as an
 
18
example
.  Or the fact that some physicians
 -- 
Dr 
Winter
is 
an
 example of this
 -- 
made 
early switches to
heat-treated products 
based on their assessment of the
evidence at the time
, 
whereas others, I'm 
being
generous, perhaps more rooted in scientific backgrounds
,
were slower to move away from what were the obvious and
better treatment options
.
It is possible differences in haematologists may
have arisen because those trained as physicians were
more focused on the condition of their patients
, 
whereas
those whose training was rooted in pure science might
have 
been more inclined to 
wait
 
until 
facts had been
established to a 
scientific 
standard of 
proof
.
Let's 
have a 
look at 1973
.  
Bearing all those points
in 
mind
, let's have a look at 1973.  
Lawrence, this is the first of the documents,
please, on the screen, 
WITN1055172.
Sir, 
this is 
a
 letter from Dr Jones at the Newcastle
Haemophilia Centre to 
Mr and Mrs Longstaff, 
the parents
of
 Peter Longstaff
, 
who grew up and married 
Carol
Grayson. 
A
 small point
, 
but 
a
 point I will refer to later on
in these submissions
, 
top right-hand corner
, obviously
the heading, "Newcastle 
Haemophilia Centre
", "
Attic
Laboratory
"
.  12 April 1973 is the date.
 
19
Now
, 
I will refer 
a
 few times to Peter Jones.  He is
a
 name that's familiar to all.  Didn't give evidence
.
There are reasons for that
.  
But he was 
a
 significant
person and 
a
 significant doctor, 
a
 significant
individual within the 
--Result #228--

  
Sir, may I just make one small correction.  I'm
very grateful to Ms Milligan for bringing this to my
attention.
I referred to 
a
 reference
, 
which is FACT000005
, 
to
the 1943 Ministry of Health memorandum.  She expressed
to me
, 
and she is right
, 
that the reference should in
fact be NHBT0000091_011
.
Instead
,
 sir
,
 of patient choice, the shadow 
of
experimentation looms large over this Inquiry
.
  The
evidence from victims tells us consent was not freely
given
, 
but the disturbing evidence that concerns
experimentation and clinical studies is obvious and
before us.  The 
"
only good
"
 letter we examined earlier
bears on this issue for obvious reason.
We have had examples of this.  I'm going to be
referring at the moment to the Royal Free
.
The Royal Free's late adopt
ion
 of concentrates gave
rise
,
 we suggest
,
 to 
a
 greater responsibility on behalf
of Drs Kernoff and Tuddenham to weigh the benefit versus
risk of concentrates to each individual patient
.
 

3 February 2023

It was well known by 1978 that 
NANB
 was 
a 
particular
risk in concentrates.  It was not believed at that time,
that
 
was 
what was 
thought, to be so prolific 
a
 risk in
cryoprecipitate.  We suggest 
that 
there is 
a
 connection
between Drs Kernoff and Tuddenham switching 
patients
 to
concentrates and at the same time retaining 
a
 policy of
obtaining blood samples from patients in order to study
hepatitis
.
The late adopt
ion
 of concentrates at the Royal Free
put the physicians there in 
a
 particularly advantageous
position
 
when in 1982 the risk of AIDS became apparent,
because there had only been 
a
 relatively short interval
since the use of cryoprecipitate had stopped.
We suggest that there was another choice available
but not taken
, 
that 
Drs
 Kernoff and Tuddenham failed to
take advantage of at the Royal Free, which was to
acknowledge the experience of cryoprecipitate treatment
and revert to it, reducing the possible 
incidence
 of
further infection with AIDS
.
Professor Lee gave evidence to the Lindsay Tribunal
concerning the organisation at the Royal Free, prior to
'
78.  
The 
reference
 
is at LIND0000326_0005.
Well, 
at the Royal Free they went on using it
probably 
for 
longer than other places
, 
and this was
because Katharine Dormandy had this pioneering
 
46
experience
,
 I suppose
,
 and was very enthusiastic about
cryoprecipitate.  She, Professor Lee
 
went on to say,
said
, "
I'm afraid our centres are full of disasters
".  
She in 1978
, 
referring to Professor Dormandy
, 
died,
just 
at the point 
the new centre had been built
, and 
two
co-
directors
 
were 
put in
, Dr Kernoff
 and 
Dr Tuddenham
.
They were young doctors 
and 
they came in 
'78 
and 
very
rapidly 
change
d
 everybody to concentrate.  There had
been some people who 
had 
had concentrate before then but
I think up until '78,the majority were still probably on
cryoprecipitate
.
Dr Tuddenham tells us that 
when he came to the Royal
Free as the Haemophilia Centre Director in 1978
,
Katharine Dormandy was terminally ill and 
the 
service
was then 
being
 run by Dr Eleanor Goldman
, 
with the
assistance of 
a
 senior nurse
.
Dr Tuddenham goes on to tell us how arrangements
changed once he and Professor Kernoff took their
directorships.  
That
 
is
 in reference WITN343
5
002_0009.
He says
:
"
To begin with obtaining supplies of treatment
materials
, 
cryoprecipitate, plasma
, 
NHS concentrates of
factor 
IX
 or factor VIII 
..."
Sorry
, 
I will change that in 
a
 moment
:
"...
 and commercial factor concentrates was handled
 
47
by Dr Goldman.  As soon as Dr 
... 
Kernoff arrived as my
co-director in mid-
19
78
, 
he took 
that
 
over
 
...
Dr Kernoff
, 
with his research interest
 in blood
transmitted hepatitis instituted a plasma/serum bank of
stored frozen samples, taken regularly from patients
attending for 
treatment
.
"
Why was the Royal Free attractive to
Professor Kernoff?  Logically
, 
given his interest in
post-transfusion hepatitis
, 
would it have not made more
sense for him to look
 
for 
a
 position 
in a centre 
with
a
 higher incidence of post-transfusion hepatitis?
It is possible that Professor Kernoff's attraction
to the Royal Free was the comparative number of patients
who had not by 
'
78 been exposed to 
large pool
concentrates.
We suggest that the work of Professors Kernoff and
Lee in their 
'
85 paper entitled "High risk of non-A
non-B hepatitis after 
a
 first exposure to volunteer or
commercial clotting factor concentrates" would
constitute clinical research
, 
in that Professor Kernoff
altered the treatment of haemophilia patients with the
intention of following them up and establishing the rate
with which they became infected with post-transfusion
hepatitis
.
Now, in the early days of the use of blood
 
48
concentrates as treatment
, 
and essentially during the
time 
whereby
 
there's
 evidence before this Inquiry of
experimentation, it wasn't in fact that long 
ago
.  In
1947 we had the drafting of the Nuremberg Code.  The
Nuremberg 
Code 
emphasises that voluntary consent of the
human subject is essential when experimenting on them.
And I quote:
"This means that the person involved should have
legal capacity to give consent
; should be so situated as
to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the
intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit,
duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of
constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient
knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the
subject matter involved as to enable him to make
an
 understanding and enlightened decision."
In 
a
 moment I will turn to licensing and discuss its
role in the facts that you have to consider
, 
but before
I do let me summarise what we say about consent, the
timely provision of information, experimentation and
harm and the consequences that may follow
.
The criminal law is
,
 in effect
,
 the bottom line of
regulation.  Criminal law says that if people harm each
other then there will be consequences.  Doctors have no
special immunity.  
A
 doctor treating 
a
 patient and
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  49
touching them for the purposes of 
a
 diagnosis and
possible treatment does so with the consent of
the
 patient who has come to the doctor for their medical
expertise
.  
Well
, 
so far so good.
Haemophiliacs suffer from 
an
 inherited disorder
which means they require expert medical support
throughout their lives
.
  If 
a
 doctor invasively treats
a
 patient without their consent and harm is caused
, 
then
they open themselves up to 
a
 prosecution.
Now
,
 of course
, 
the CPS in this country or relevant
prosecution authorities in Northern Ireland and Scotland
will have to consider whether it is in the public
interest to prosecute any case
, 
and some cases are
clearer perhaps than others.
I was discussing this the other day with
Clive
 
Smith, the Chair of The Haemophilia Society
.  
He
is 
an
 experienced criminal advocate as well.  And his
point, 
a
 good one, is that there may be real clarity in
cases where patients were not told of their infected
status and passed on their infection to their partners.
That might mark 
a
 high point of criminality.
But all treatment without consent causing harm needs
to be considered through that
, 
as I call it
, 
the 
bottom
line 
of regulation, 
the
 criminal law.
 
50
Now, 
it is now 2023
, 
and in some cases it has been
many decades, perhaps even 50 years since the individual
was infected.  Time itself is no barrier to prosecution
of cases.  You will have seen our discussion within our
written submission
,
 sir
,
 of the difficulties of the
operation of the old 
Year and a Day 
Rule that poses
particular
 problems for allegations of 
a
 homicide.
Obtaining the interest and engagement of local
police authorities is not going to be easy.  It is
always going to be difficult.  They will regard these
cases as complex cases.  That doesn't mean that they
should not consider them but we have to accept that
there will be real difficulties 
in looking at that 
in
the future
.
One of the factors that
, 
sir
, 
this Inquiry needs to
consider, the compensation framework needs to consider
in the future, is the lost opportunity for
accountability through criminal law and criminal
prosecution of individual doctors because of the passage
of time and the prevarication by the state and the
failure to own up or 
'
fess up to their own culpability.
Let me deal now and turn to licensing.  In the
creation of this scandal
, 
the perils of 
a
 system where
doctors decided to make their patient
s
' choices for them
went hand in hand with 
a
 failure to properly regulate
 
51
the use of concentrates.  You
, 
sir
, 
have heard and seen
a
 great deal of evidence on the machinations 
of 
the
licensing regime.  This effectively operated as 
a
 chain.
The Department of Health Medicines 
Division
 evaluated
the licensing application and sent it to the most
relevant specialist subcommittee of the Committee on
Safety of Medicines, the CSM, which
, 
in the case of
blood products
, 
went to the Biologicals Subcommittee.
The Biologicals Subcommittee fed its recommendations to
the CSM which
, 
in turn
, 
advised the Minister of the
Department of Health
, 
who is the Licensing Authority.
Against 
a
 backdrop of the decades of awareness of
the risk posed by blood products that we have outlined
and particularly the risks 
from 
larger pools, one of the
central questions 
for
 this Inquiry to answer is how is
it that this country's regulator came to licen
s
e the use
of large pool commercial concentrates in the early 
'
70s
?
That was 
a
 decision which undeniably and irrevocably
changed the landscape of risk.
The answer
, 
perhaps
, 
boils down to this, as with
those administering blood products
: 
the regulators
failed if their duty to assess the risk by reference not
only to the harm it might cause but also to the relative
benefit to be gained.
Now
,
 that was supposed to be the essence of the task
 
52
entrusted to them by section 19 of the Medicines Act
1968.  They were asked to have 
particular
 regard to
safety
, 
efficacy and quality.
The first product licences issued in respect of
concentrates were those for Hemofil and Kryobulin in
February and March 
'
73.  As we have already discussed,
at that time, it had been known for decades that blood
products carried 
a
 risk of virus, transmission
 
and
, 
more
importantly
, 
that the risk increased as pool sizes
themselves increased
.
We know that
.  
As 
an
 example
, 
a
 memo produced in
1946 from the Ministry of Health, DHSC01000008_191, the
Ministry's consultant 
adviser 
on blood transfusion wrote
at that time:
"Whil
st 
homologous serum jaundice
 
follows the use of
whole blood in very few of the recipients, the use of
dried
 plasma is followed by the development of jaundice
in about 10
 per cent
 of those receiving it.  This
incidence is probably halved if plasma is used which is
made from plasma pools derived from the blood of only
ten donors instead of from large pools derived from the
blood of greater numbers."
Can I emphasise plasma pools 
being
 referred to of
ten donors.  Anything in that Ministry of Health
document above ten was 
a
 large pool.
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  53
That was 1946.  Come 
'
73, the time of the licence
approvals, it was also known that imported blood
products, particularly those obtained from the 
US,
carried 
a
 higher degree of infection.  In fact
, 
that
very same month
, 
an
 expert group was convened by the
Department of Health to create self-sufficiency targets
.
The Inquiry's chronology quotes the Archer Report at
page 28
, 
which states:
"In 
'
73 the Department of Health convened 
a
 group of
experts to assess the likely future requirements of
Factor VIII concentrate.  It met on 20 March 1973 and
quickly agreed that the UK shall become self
-
sufficient
in the shortest possible time.  It estimated that to
achieve self-sufficiency would require 400,000 donations
of blood annually of which 275,000 should be used for
Factor VIII concentrates."
That effort was driven
, 
at least in part
, 
by the
Department's knowledge that foreign blood products
carried 
a
 great
er
 risk of infection.  That much was
admitted in the 2007 Self-Sufficiency Report
, 
since
withdrawn as a result of the compelling critique in the
dissertation of our client
, 
Carol Grayson
.
There can be no room for doubt that the specialists
who constituted the Biologicals Subcommittee of the CSM,
as well as the CSM itself, were alive to these issues.
 
54
For
 
example
, in its consideration of the product licence
application for Hemofil, DHSC0105593_006, at
paragraph 26
, 
the CSM noted:
"The major disadvantage of currently available
commercial preparation
, 
such as Hemofil
, 
is that they
are prepared from very large plasma pools and carry the
risk of transmitting hepatitis virus.  
Hyland
 screen all
their donor
s for 
hepatitis associated antigen
, 
which
reduces but does not eliminate this risk
."  
We know that Hemofil at that time was prepared from
pools of at least 
1,000
 donors.  Kryobulin was
manufactured from 
a
 plasma pool of at least 1,000
donors.  See
, 
in these terms
, 
reference SHPL0000071_135.
A
 report from Dr Maycock in January 1973 noted that
pool sizes for Kryobulin were smaller than those for
Hemofil.  
That 
reference is MHRA
00333322_
057.
So we ask this question: how on Earth could the CSM
approve 
a
 jump from ten donor
s
 
to
 
1,000
 donors?
A 
Ministry of Health document from 
'
63, ten years
prior, states that:
"All dried plasma or serum issued in the 
United
Kingdom
 is prepared from pools made from not 
more than
ten 
donors
."
That
 
is
 at JPAC0000162
_021
.
We submit that the leap in pool sizes was nothing
 
55
short of recklessness.  We know
, 
sir
, that 
this got
worse
, 
pooling and re-pooling.  There was 
a
 well
traversed path of apprehension towards larger pools of
plasma and for good reason.  On the other hand
, 
there
was 
a
 complete absence of evidence to justify increasing
pool size or testing 
under 
control conditions
, 
compliant
with Nuremberg
, 
those potential ways forward in relation
to possible ways 
of 
try
ing
 to establish safety, thrown
to the wind
.
That reckless decision would prove to be 
a
 gateway
to the infected blood scandal.  Thereafter
, 
pool sizes
continued to sky rocket
, 
climbing even to 50,000 donors
and then 300,000 donors
, 
with the advent of re
-
pooling.
Infections
, 
of course
, 
sky rocketed.
These are not and were not complicated questions of
medicine which are now 
being
 interpreted with the
benefit of hindsight.  This is 
a
 question of basic
maths.  If exposure to one donor's blood poses
a
 percentage of risk, what happens when concentrate is
made from the blood of two donors
: 
the risk doubles.
Children can do that sum.  It should also be remembered
that the initial decision to licen
s
e was not 
a
 binary
one.  The Licensing Authority's choice was not merely
between yes to allowing concentrates or no to banning
concentrates.  It had the power to work slowly and
 
56
incrementally and to impose safety conditions or
qualifications as 
a
 precaution
.
Those conditions could have included, 
for
 
example
,
restricting pool sizes
; 
only permitting blood from
certain sources
; 
testing and batch release certificates
which could be combined with 
a
 cautious product rollout
;
product warnings and guidance.  All of those measures
could have controlled or mitigated the risk.  Instead,
what happened
?  
Everything was allowed in
; 
caution
thrown to the wind.
Our submission on this decision-making is simple.
That expansion 
in 
donor exposure without controlled
measures cannot be justified now and could not be
justified then.
There was 
a
 failure by the Licensing Authority
, 
the
CSM
 
and its Biologicals Subcommittee to treat patient
safety with primacy.  The CSM said in its consideration
of the Hemofil application, DHSC0105593_6
: 
"
It may be considered that the decision to use this
material could be left to the individual clinician who
can balance the potential hazard against the anticipated
therapeutic benefit to the patient.
"
Similar risk benefit considerations were reported in
the CSM's reflections, informally 
relayed
 -- this is
from Norman Berry to Dr Eibl
, 
and referred to in
 

3 February 2023

, 
and these were shared in
relation to Immuno's 1973 application
:
"
The Committee see
 
the justification of some risk of
hepatitis in treating 
a
 haemophiliac who would otherwise
die from haemorrhage
."  
Yet notwithstanding the CSM view or understanding
that the risk should only be entertained for those for
whom there might be grave consequences, that
qualification or caution did not appear anywhere whether
in licensing decisions or in requirements for product
literature.  It should have done and
, 
as we know,
clinicians did not take that approach
, 
and they ought to
have done
.
Now, although licences did not always run back to
back or for their entire period of five years
, 
we
suggest that it is instructive to look at what was going
on and what was known every five years after those
initial licences.  We fast forward to 
'
78 and using The
Lancet alone as 
a
 source
, 
although there are many
others, in 
a
 study by Professor Alter 
with 
inoculated
chimpanzees
, it was concluded that NANB hepatitis
 seems
to be due to 
a
 transmissible agent 
which 
can persist and
remain infectious for long periods
, PRSE0004515, 
and of
course 
a
 study by Professor Preston and his
contemporaries 
concluded
 that NANB hepatitis was more
 
58
serious and 
progressive than was generally thought to be
the case, PRSE0
003622.
We also know that around that time the yellow card
system reporting to the CSM incidents of NANB hepatitis
following treatment from various Factor VIII products
and discussed in the recently served witness statement
of Anne Ryan
, 
exhibits 
a
 table and 
seven 
such reports
from 
'
79
.  
The table
, we have 
reference
 
WITN7183007,
another reference to it is at WITN7183
00
6.  It is
unclear as to why they chose 
1979
 and what the records
from the earlier year show
.
But those references should have resulted in action.
If one considers the 1989 affidavit of the CSM's
chairman in 
a
 judicial review relating to
anti-depressant licences, WITN6406
0
24, Professor Asher
says this
.  
This is at page 9, paragraph 15.2
, 
that the
yellow card scheme distinguished between serious and
minor reactions.  Serious reactions were to be defined
as those which were fatal, life threatening, disabling,
incapacitating
, 
which result in or prolong
hospitalisation.  Professor Asher said that blood
disorders would always be considered serious.  Yet the
CSM and the Licensing Authority, the Ministry, were
still approving licensing and licences with ever
increasing pool sizes without adequate control
 
59
mechanisms.
Five years later in 1983
, 
knowledge of the dangers
of HIV and AIDS have become part of everyone's lives.
What is more, at that stage, the CDC had published its
reports which linked the transmission of HIV to blood
products.  The CDC notified directors of the Haemophilia
Centres and advised that patients and parents should be
aware of the potential risks.  The reference to that is
BAYP00000
1
8_119.  Why didn't that happen here?  Why did
the CSM and Licensing Authority not take similar
measure
s?  
Why instead were licensing continually
approved with increasing pool sizes and without
adequately controlled mechanisms
?
The CSM's push for the Licensing Authority to move
towards heat-treated Factor VIII came very late in 
'
84
and into 
'
85.
I refer now to the minutes of the meeting of
22 November
 
1984, DHSC0003947_015.
Dr 
Joseph
 Smith informed the Committee that heat
treatment of Factor VIII, which is used in the treatment
of haemophiliacs
, 
abolished detectable infectivity of
AIDS virus added to the preparation, therefore companies
should be encouraged to apply 
for the variation of
licences to permit 
widespread use of heat-treated
Factor VIII
, 
so that the inciden
ce 
of AIDS in
 
60
haemophiliacs might be reduced.
The Committee -- this is the final paragraph --
requested that the Licensing Authority proposed to the
companies concerned that they make early applications
for variations to use 
a
 dry heating process in the
manufacture of their Factor VIII products.  Even at that
late stage
, 
the Authorities' approach was not to mandate
heat treatment
, 
backed by 
a
 threat of pulling licences
or 
indeed
 to pull licences
, 
but instead ma
de 
proposals
to the manufacturers that they make early applications
for variations
.
We suggest that 
a
 closer look reveals that the
Licensing Authority's approach to those variation
applications were slipshod and we say that they were
focused on external appearances rather than 
being
genuinely motivated by patient safety.  Consider
, for
example, 
in this regard
, 
the internal Immuno
communications
, 
SHPL00008_026
, 
in which it was reported
.
"
Subject to minor alterations in title and
direct
ion
s circular
, 
we 
have 
been awarded 
a
 product
licence modification.  We have
, 
however
, 
been informed
,
both unofficially and officially
, 
that the information
submitted by us for this modification was most
inadequate and
, 
but for the 
panic 
situation which
existed to get everywhere on heat treated material as
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  61
quickly as possible
, 
we would have been turned down.
They expected far better proof of inactivation with
evidence obtained against six, seven or eight different
viruses.  They wanted greater evidence shown by clinical
evaluation that the product remained equally effective
and with no increase in side effects."
Make no mistake
, 
sir
 -- make no mistake --
a
 regulator truly motivated by patient safety would have
pulled the non-inactivated products and only allowed
those with adequate evidence of viral inactivation.
We repeat the actions of the CSM and the Licensing
Authority were reckless.
Although we have presented our analysis by reference
to those five year intervals, it must be remembered that
those intervals
, 
representing theoretical product
licence renewal applications
, 
were not the only or
isolated windows of opportunity.  The Licensing
Authority had the power to revoke, suspend or vary
licences at any time if the concentrates could no longer
be regarded as safe or efficacious.
Despite all of the information that was known to
those authorities
, 
as this Inquiry has shown, those
powers were never exercised
.  
They should have been.
Again, the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn
from that action or inaction is that patient safety came
 
62
second and firmly behind commercial continuity.
Finally
, 
we highlight that the efficacy of any
regulatory regime also has to be judged by its
workarounds or loopholes.  The Medicines Act 1968
created significant loopholes in the licensing regime
which may have contributed to the erroneous decisions
being
 made
 
and to the extent of infections which were
spread.  Can we highlight two important points
.
First, one of the most significant loopholes was the
named patient basis exception.  Now
, 
that allowed
medical professionals to go about purchasing and
importing blood products which had not been granted
a
 product licence at their whim
, 
or
 
perhaps
 
because of
the effective advertising by pharmaceutical companies
.
There was no adequate regulatory oversight of the
use of products on that basis until May 
'
84.
Sir, as you are aware we say much more on that
loophole in our written submissions.  But for the
purposes of today's submission, we say that that was the
"doctor
 knows best
" 
dog
ma
, robbing 
a regulatory 
regime
of any 
teeth
 and cutting it off at the knees
.
Second
, 
there is 
evidence
 that licensing decisions
bypass the CSM and the CSM Biological Subcommittee and
therefore evaded the scrutiny of those who might
reasonably have expected to have been in the know on the
 
63
risks posed by the products and 
indeed
 of the developing
science
.
As we explain in our written submissions, the
statutory regime only required the CSM's input were
a
 licence to be refused.  So the system was this: the
statutory system was for 
an
 application to be made for
licensing, that would go to the Medicines Division
, 
and
then if it were or might be rejected or refused it would
then go to the CSM.
Although some of the evidence presented in this
Inquiry has suggested that in fact the CSM's views were
routinely sought, the evidence disclosed just two
perhaps three
 
days 
ago
 now shows that this was not
always the case.  And this was the second loophole.
The second witness statement of Dr Diana Walford,
the Senior Medical Officer at the Department of
Health
 -- the 
witness statement I refer to is
 
this
,
WITN4461158, disclosed on Wednesday
 -- 
explained that
in
 
1977 the CSM and 
the 
CSM Biological Subcommittee were
not consulted on Immuno
's 
variation application in
respect of Kryobulin.  That 
had 
included the fact that
it sought to move from German and Austrian sources of
plasma to those from the US.
What's more
, 
it is also apparent from that statement
that Immuno were able to conceal knowledge of the
 
64
American plasmas
' 
higher risk of hepatitis
 
from the
Licensing Authority.
Undoubtedly
 
the loophole that was the lack of
routine CSM input contributed to that situation
, 
but
,
and this was something that the Inquiry's Rule 9 request
also picked up on, the licensing regime also failed to
impose any legal obligation on 
a
 manufacturer to
disclose that information by way of reference in
relation to applications.
Those are
,
 we say
,
 issues that arose because of the
opt
 
in and toothless nature of that regulatory regime.
New chapter heading.  What should have happened?
There was 
a
 history of research
,
 sir
,
 dating back to
Pasteu
r 
which showed the efficacy of heat treatment
 
and
,
in 
particular
 in relation to vaccines, its use in
rendering safe plasma products.
The effects of heat treatment 
in 
rendering safe
otherwise potentially harmful substances is well
established and dates back to the work with bacteria in
the mid-19th century.  The discover
ies 
that
,
 first
,
there existed viruses as well as bacteria
, 
and
subsequently that these viruses could also be vulnerable
to heat
, 
predate the events giving rise to this Inquiry
by decades.  We have set out in our 
written 
closing
submission
 
how this knowledge progressed
 
and how
,
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  65
through the Second World War
, 
albumin was 
rendered 
safe
through pasteurisation
.
Given 
that efforts
 by Behringwerke in Germany to
virally inactivate concentrates had borne fruit by 1978,
BPL, Blood Products Laboratory, were 
dilatory
 in their
approach 
to developing virally inactivated concentrates
.
Once 
a
 concerted effort was made
, 
from 
a
 standing start
it took no longer than two
 
years for fractionators to
produce effectively heat
-
treated concentrates.
If untreated blood products had been prevented from
use, the very market forces which drove their
dissemination into this country and into the 
vein
s of
this community would have meant that the companies
supplying this material would have turned their minds
and their money to the inactivation of viruses within
their products.
By the early 
'
70s and the advent of factor
concentrates, we find 
an
 odd paradox where it is well
known amongst those in blood collection and transfusion
medicine that the pooling of blood plasma without any
viral inactivation technique will increase the 
risk
 of
virus
 transmission to the recipient.  Yet at the same
time we have those with 
an
 interest in haemophilia care,
whether they be doctors or pharmaceutical companies
,
ra
c
ing to produce blood products which were to present
 
66
a
 significantly greater risk of transmitting viruses
.
One might expect that
, 
fixed with the knowledge that
increasing plasma pool sizes increases risk, those
developing and marketing the products might have taken
some time and effort and expense first to attempt to
virally inactivate the filth 
that 
they were producing to
haemophiliacs as 
a
 wonder drug
.
Now
, 
there is some evidence
, Dr Foster, I referred
to now -- there's some evidence -- 
Dr Foster said 
that
this wasn't so
.  
He said 
that 
Factor VIII protein was
considered so heat
-labile 
that 
the concept of subjecting
it to pasteurisation was in
conceivable to him
.
There are problems with that assertion.  The first
is that heat treatment and other viral inactiva
tion
techniques were clearly not considered unthinkable by
all fractionators.  The chronology of events dictates
that at the time Dr Foster and some other witnesses to
the Inquiry were still averring 
that the idea was
unthinkable
, Behringwerke
 scientists 
had 
clearly had the
idea 
a number of 
years before and had some success in
developing pasteurisation techniques
.
The second 
problem 
is that 
Behringwerke were no
alone in taking steps to virally inactivate products.
They 
were not 
mavericks at the vanguard of product
safety, they just got further than some of their
 
67
American rivals.
There 
is
 
an
 extract 
of the
 book 
Blood on their Hands
by Eric Weinberg and 
Donna Shaw available on Relativity.
We will supply the 
Relativity 
reference at a later
stage.  The book recounts the story of Mr Weinberg's
investigation and subsequent conduct of the litigation
in America
 
taken by haemophiliacs infected with HIV
against the pharmaceutical companies, of which
,
 sir
,
 as
you are aware
, 
our client group took part
.
Chapter 9 of that book
 
from page 94 onwards
described Dr Weinberg's first contact and meeting with
Dr Edward Shanbrom, the chief medical adviser at 
Hyland
with 
a responsibility for the 
first 
development of
concentrates 
in 
the 
United States
.  Dr Shanbrom 
is
 said
to have raised concerns about the viral 
safety of
concentrates 
in 1970 
after noticing patients who were
HBV antibody positive were 
nevertheless 
falling ill with
a
 new kind of hepatitis
.
  Dr Shanbrom is said to have
been slowly let go by Hyland as a result of the
expression of those concerns
.
Dr Shanbrom would
,
 of course
,
 ultimately go on to
develop 
a
 detergent washing system for virally
inactivating concentrates which was licensed by the
New York Red Cross
.
Elsewhere
, 
the Inquiry has seen evidence that
 
68
Travenol was investigating viral inactivation technique
s
in
 the 
'
70s, including heat treatment
, 
but that its
research priority was slowly downgraded during the
course of 
'
78 from 
a 
grade A 
priority 
to 
a 
grade
 
B
priority.
It is expressly stated within Travenol memos that
the research cannot proceed any further without more
funding and dedicated research time.  References to that
are CGRA0000213
, 
onwards 214, 5, 6 and 7
.
Why wasn't time and resource given to this research?
That's because the pharmaceutical companies didn't need
to.  They were able to 
peddle
 their contaminated product
with the knowledge
, 
consent and approval 
of
 US 
and
UK 
regulators.
Travenol did
, 
in 
'
79
, urgently 
upgrade their
research into pasteurisation
.  
But not through motives
of trying to protect patients
; 
that was for 
the
commercial reasons
.  
And 
for 
no other reason than to
protect their market position in light of Behringwerke's
development of 
a
 heat-treated product.
Reference to that is 
CGRA0000218.
I will tie these threads together.  There is no
scientific or technological discovery which takes place
between 
19
70 and 
'
84 which suddenly enables viral
inactivation.  It is old science and old technology
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  69
which is utilised ultimately to successfully virally
inactivate 
the 
products
: 
heating 
a
 product in
a
 stabilis
ing 
solution
, 
the same technique applied to
albumin for decades.  Intellectual curiosity
 
may have
been lacking
, 
but the only thing really missing from
unlocking 
a
 safer treatment was 
an
 incentive.
It is important that had the UK licensing authority
done its job properly
 
and refused to grant licences to
these lethal products, 
a
 clear and loud message would
have been broadcast not just to the pharmaceuticals but
to other regulators across Europe and North America.
That message would have been that the risk/reward
balance did not tilt in favour of reward and that these
products were unacceptably dangerous.
That
,
 in turn
,
 would have provided the incentive
that pharmaceutical companies would have needed to
address viral threat properly and sooner.  After all
,
when they are forced to put their minds to the task in
light of AIDS
, 
they
 
managed to largely succeed in the
space of little more than 18 months.
I now turn to AIDS.  This is 
a
 very short section.
The 
damage
 had already been done by 1982.  The
domino effect of the failure to protect people from the
dangers of infection with hepatitis meant that
haemophiliacs were 
inevitably
 going to be infected with
 
70
whatever viruses were swimming in the vast pools of
blood from paid donor
s
 
in
 the 
United States
.
Essentially
, 
our submission in relation to the
transmission
 of AIDS into the haemophilia community is
that 
this is 
a
 domino effect
, 
and what 
had
 happened is
that the earlier failure to protect people from the use
of blood products and the obvious danger
s 
from the
viruses contained in those products meant that so many
people were already infected by the time the message
came through in the early 
'
80s.
Dr Franklin
, 
at paragraph
s
 36 and 37 of his
statement, WITN4032001, says:
"By 1982 there had been 
a
 few cases of transfusion
associated AIDS in the USA
 
and also 
a
 few men with
haemophilia had the condition."
Going on to say, 
regarding awareness 
of an
associa
tion 
between AIDS and 
the use of 
blood products:
"For transfusion associated AIDS, 
late 1982
 in the
USA
.  
For plasma product
s
 
in
 
patients in the
 UK during
19
83
.  
I found out 
[
about that connection
, from his
point of view]
 
via
 medical journals, news items and word
of mouth."
Sir
, 
you have our submissions 
which 
set out in
detail the chronology of events leading to the awareness
of knowledge of the risk of AIDS within 
blood 
products
 
71
at that time.  Clearly
, 
insufficient
 (sic)
 was done to
withdraw those products.  The answer should have been
:
get them off the shelves, don't use them, dispose of
them.
I now turn to campaigners.  Lawrence

if you would

please

We are going to be looking at some images

protesters,

Thank you, Lawrence.
The incredible campaigning work of 
Carol Grayson 
and
her husband Pete Longstaff
, 
a
 severe haemophiliac who
died of his infections
, 
should be recognised by us all.
Carol and Pete 
did everything possible to bring this
dark
 passage of history into the light
.
Ms Wintle joined 
with
 Carol 
and
,
 together
,
 their
campaigning became their jobs, unfunded
.  The basics of
life and healthcare became 
subjugated to the campaign.
I recall standing with Ms Wintle in the area outside
of the tearoom in now
, 
I believe
 -- 
I 
am
 told by
Mr Harrison
 -- 
the torn
-
down building 
that 
we used to
inhabit for this Inquiry
, I was with her, standing
outside the tearoom there, 
and we spoke about her years
of campaigning
 -- 
and this is not just 
a
 reference to
her but all of the other campaigners
 -- 
the years of
campaigning, the lack of ability to pursue 
a
 career, how
it took over everything, family
 
life, finances.
This will have happened to many campaigners.  The
life of campaigners
,
 sir
,
 is very different to the
commercial lobbyist paid for by corporate interests who
don't have to fund their own travel, paper, printing and
telephone costs
.
  Their and other
s' 
relentless
campaign
ing 
kept the very issues we 
have
 
examined
 for

four 
years 
in the public eye in the discussion
.
Carol
 and Colette's 
work has been foundational.
Other campaigners and this Inquiry have followed in the
path they worked so hard to forge
.
They were not the only campaigners.  But
, 
as we have
heard from the evidence, from politicians, they were
prolific and constant.  In the history of this scandal
,
Carol Grayson's name and Colette Wintle's name 
should be
remembered, 
acknowledged
 and honoured
.
Following the death of her husband, Ms Grayson
started her research 
leading to 
a
 seminal dissertation
,
available on The Haemophilia Society's website
, 
entitled
"MA
 
Gender
, 
Culture
 
and 
Development.  Blood Flows Not
Just Through Our Veins but Through Our Minds
"
.
I read only part, chapter 6
, 
the conclusion:
"I believe that my analysis with the SSR
 (
the
Self-Sufficiency Report
) 
reveals that much more could
have been done by the government and medical
practitioners to protect haemophiliacs from the risk of
contamination with HIV and hepatitis viruses at every
stage.  Once they became aware that haemophiliacs were
infected
, 
they disempowered patients by withholding
information, denying them informed choice in relation to
treatment, carrying out unethical research and
, 
in some
cases
, 
failing to treat their medical conditions.
"
 
74
We suggest we should all pay attention to what
Ms Grayson was writing there
, 
because she foreshadowed
so many of the aspects that we have been considering in
the evidence over these many years of this Inquiry
.
The campaigning work by so many didn't just have to
address government but also had to look at times to the
work of the represented body
, 
The Haemophilia Society.
Now
, 
The Haemophilia Society
 
we say
 
without question
has become more representative and is trying to work
with the community.  
But that 
has not always been
seamless.  
The letter from Chris Hodgson
 that 
was
examined 
within
 the Inquiry time, WITN1055
0
79
, 
referring
to the campaign 
now
 
being
 more inclusive
.  
Suggesting
that it hadn't been so inclusive in past
.
Women campaigners and women infected with hepatitis
and
/or 
HIV have always faced stigma and discrimination
and had to fight tooth and nail for inclusion 
with
in
campaigns and consideration by government
.  
Clair
 
Walton
and 
anonymous witness 
WITN1388 were forced
, 
through this
lack of recognition
, 
to start their own campaign for
those women 
who were 
infected with HIV by their
partners
, 
who had of course been infected by 
blood
products themselves
.
Non-haemophiliac women with HIV were not catered for
by the haemophiliac centres and instead were treated at
 
75
HIV
 
clinics
, 
where the ready assumption was always made
that they had been infected through 
drug use
 or had been
sex workers.  At times the evidence 
has 
demonstrated
that women 
have
 been 
relegated 
to the back row and
excluded from the heart of discussion
.
  You will recall
Ms Pappenheim, at paragraph 11 of her statement,
WITN45040001 
referring to the launch of the women's
project.  
She 
refers to it 
as 
being
 very important 
the
charity was recognising
 -- was 
seek
ing
 
to engage
 with
the women affected by the scandal
.
But this is what happens, isn't it?  If 
the
Government push
es 
aways or refuses to consider its own
culpability then
, 
in turn
, 
it 
avoids 
its own
responsibility to sort out its mess
, 
instead
 
leaving the
debris of victims and the avoidance of support for those
infected both directly and indirectly
.
During the course of the Inquiry
, 
I was sent
a
 message by Clair Walton
, 
whom I represent.  I read it:
"As 
an
 infected widow
, 
I have been out on 
a
 limb and
ignored in the community.  Most of my adult life
, 
since
23
, 
has been consumed with dealing with the aftermath of
my husband's HIV diagnosis.  Caring for my dying
husband, making sense of my own HIV infection, 
loss of
family li
f
e, discrimination, stigma and near-death from
AIDS defining illness, relentless 30
-
year battle with
 
76
the MFT 
over the charge on my home, 
restricting my
freedom to move away and get
 
on with my life
, 
attempting
to 
maintain 
a
 career I love, 
pursue a semblance of
normal life, 
the campaign for justice and recognition
and understanding of the needs or the needs of women
living with HIV."
Then she finished that by saying then we get the
THT.
Now
, 
the effects of the decade
s
 of the delay
ed
acknowledgement of harm 
done 
by the 
state is that,
instead of considering and dealing with the fallout from
the NHS and Ministry of Health's 
failures to protect its
vulnerable patients
, 
what we have instead is 
a
 failure
to consider how far that harm has extended
.
  Decades of
delays, not just in compensation but in rounded support
for its victims or families
.
Haemophiliacs 
who 
have been infected all face
complicating features of their conditions and the
combination of medications also give rise to adverse
effects through treatment 
inter
action.  You will recall
the evidence from the witness before the Archer Inquiry
reference ARCH00000
0
4_0010.  The description which
I recall, which stuck if my 
mind
, 
is 
being
 
a
 
bit
 like
being
 on chemotherapy for the rest of your life
.
Long-term

  77
co-infected with hep B and HIV 
may go on to develop
various chronic infections.  Some of the complications
are 
costochondritis
, 
fibromyalgia, 
early onset of
menopause, deterioration of the spinal dis
cs
 
connected
to the anti-viral chemotherapy 
used to treat chronic
HIV
.
We are also behind
, 
as I recall
, 
in speaking to
an 
anonymous client
 
I represent, also 
very much behind
in our research as to 
the long-term effect 
upon an aging
population 
of haemophiliacs with infections and
co-infections
.
The damage to the liver in an infected individual is
well known, 
as 
is 
the increased possibility of
developing cancer
, 
but the liver damage can also affect
blood platelets which
, 
if they reach 
a
 low level 
can 
be
life threatening
.
The consequences and possible complications which
arise from the infection 
via
 contaminated blood 
and the
need for support for partners of haemophiliacs and
deceased 
haemophiliacs 
can be 
identified and the 
needs
of the limited community of people 
are known.  The
partners of 
deceased 
haemophiliacs are inadequately
catered for within the NHS, as they get older they face
continuing
, 
often worsening issues with stress,
depression and PTSD
.
 
78
I spoke with 
Amanda Beesley 
the other day.  She
spoke about the fact of the way it feels to her
sometimes that she's teetering on the brink.  She spoke
about her well
-
rehearsed knitting of threads together
which might unravel
, 
as 
being
 her mental state.
The failure by Government to listen to the truth and
acknowledge its own responsibility for these decades has
multiplied the suffering.  That needs to be stated, it
needs to be recognised and it needs to be acknowledged
by the state.
Sir, I now go on to deal with recommendations.  So
this final chapter in my submissions is
 "
Recommendations
and the way forward
"
.
Sir, you will have read and seen our submissions on
recommendations.  They are at page 196 onwards.  We see
no benefit in repeating those submissions orally.
Instead
, 
I'm going to make some submissions about the
Terrence Higgins Trust, 
the 
THT, Governmental change and
then go on to suggest 
a
 proposal for you to consider as
to the delivery of your report
.
Terrence Higgins Trust.  Without wishing to take
away from the important and life changing work that the
Terrence Higgins Trust 
h
as done over the last 40 years,
their involvement with the former Macfarlane Trust
registrants is simply inappropriate.  We deal with this
 
79
in some detail in our recommendation submissions
.
I don't want to overly labour this point but I do
want to say that the former MFT, Macfarlane Trust
,
registrants'
 
objection
s to 
the THT 
are not based on any
foundation of prejudice or any sense of "
guilty
"
 
and
"
innocent
"
 victims of HIV.  Their 
objection
s are based
solely on the fact that the interest
s
 pursued by the THT
do not 
coincide
 
with those of the former registrants
and
, 
in fact
, 
conflict with them.
That point has been illustrated recently with the
THT throwing itself behind 
a
 campaign to make every
contact count, exceptionally advocating 
an
 opt out
scheme 
whereby
 every time blood is taken in 
a
 clinical
setting it ought to be tested for HIV, 
HCV
 
and
 
HBV
.
Recalling the 
vast 
amount of evidence 
you have heard
over 
the last four years
, 
sir, 
the idea that people
ought to have their blood tested for these viruses
without 
a
 proper pre-test counselling 
framework in place
is the antithesis 
of 
what the former 
MFT
 
registrants
would want to see in its place
.
At its most fundamental the residual Macfarlane
Trust funds represent power
, 
which is capable of 
being
wielded over the former registrants.  The former
registrants of the MFT Trust
, those we represent, 
want
to see those funds surrendered by the 
THT, divided
 
80
amongst the four national haemophilia societies and
employed for the purposes of 
creating monuments to the
former registrants.  This is the only way that the power
residing in the residual funds can be eradicated and the
only way in which the former registrants will be freed
from the advocacy which has been forced unwantedly 
up
on
them
.
Now
, 
I turn to Government.  Regarding Government
, 
we
must stop the head banging.  The head banging I refer to
is the head banging of campaigners and survivors against
the administrative and overly bureaucratic castle walls
of state
, 
in what has almost become 
an
 oft
-
used
hackneyed
 phrase
: 
speaking truth to power.  That only
works if power is prepared to listen.  Instead
, 
what we
have seen and discussed in this Inquiry and other
Inquiries is that power only listens randomly
,
capriciously and
, 
frankly
, 
when it is politically in the
mood and has 
a
 moment
.
It is hard to accept
, 
sir
, 
that Government lobbyist
s
paid for by corporate funds who 
employ
 basically insid
er
club members, many of them ex-politicians, ministers and
even prime ministers
, 
who automatically
, 
it
 
seems
, 
have
access when campaign groups have to increasingly get
permission from the police to demonstrate outside the
hallowed walls, it is not difficult 
to
 
say
 that
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  81
something clearly is going wrong
.
Disasters have happened in the past and disasters
are going to happen again.  Disasters of themselves are
not unusual.  So why do we find that there is no system
to cope?  Why do we find there is no system to cope with
the victims?  Campaigners should not be met with 
a
 blank
wall of state and the words "the Government line".  The
Government line
, 
phrase
 
or anything similar
, 
should be
treated 
by 
current and future ministers with scepticism
and questioning and not blind acceptance
.
A
 simple improvement
, 
we suggest
, 
would be for all
Government lines to be dated so that we know when they
started and for ministers to ask
, 
if 
that
 
is
 not
apparent
, 
for how long has this line been held?
In addition to consideration of ours and others'
proposed recommendations
, 
you may wish in your report
,
sir
, 
to comment on the need for 
an
 Inquiry
recommendation oversight system.  We have considered how
that might be done
.
This could be by 
a
 dedicated select committee or the
use of the standing departmental committees for the
relevant ministry
, 
with 
a
 
duty
 to maintain 
a
 watch on
inquiry and perhaps inquest recommendations.  Select
committees have the power to call for evidence and
witnesses to come forward and 
publicly 
seek explanations
 
82
for delay
s
 in implementation or reasons why individual
recommendations are no longer required.  This is never
going to be 
a
 perfect system
.
For
 
example
, we note that select committees have no
power to call for evidence from Members of Parliament or
ministers
, 
although generally they do secure the
co-operation of Government ministers
.
I turn now to the delivery of your report, I do so
gently and with trepidation because I
, 
respectfully
, am
going to make submissions as to the shape of your
report.
Can I suggest
, 
sir
, 
that in everything you do and
consider
, 
when looking at the evidence in this matter
and looking and then thinking about your
recommendations
, 
that you aim as far as it is humanly
possible at peace and finality.
After Penrose, Lindsay
, 
Archer
, 
let's make this the
final report on the worst medical disaster in the
history of the NHS.  So what do I mean by 
"
peace
"
?
I think I mean that we must finish the job or
, 
put it
another way, leave no loose ends.
I remember now
, 
sir
, 
you may accept many years 
ago
,
working as 
a
 paralegal employed by 
a
 terrific East End
solicitor
, 
Ms Cherry McMillen
, 
recently retired as
a
 judge in the island of Guernsey.  She always said to
 
83
me
 "
Finish the job
" 
and I 
always took th
ose 
to be wise
words.  Later on in my career, 
in moments of reflection
,
I have in odd moments whether she just meant to me
,
directly
, "
You finish the job
".  
Nevertheless it stuck
in my 
mind
 as 
a
 phrase and 
a
 touchstone for the work
that I've 
done over many 
a
 year.
Peace in the way I have described it is very
difficult to do within the powers of 
a
 statutory
inquiry
, 
because when you finish the last full stop on
the last page of your report and your report is
delivered to Government
, 
your powers as 
an
 Inquiry Chair
are extinguished.  This has every potential to leave
your report and its find
ings
 and recommendations at the
whim of Government
, 
and I think that we can establish
one thing, Government is not trusted 
by our client group
or indeed 
this community
.
So what we ask is this, you consider issuing 
a
 final
report, setting out your find
ings
 on the main evidential
points and the conclusions that follow.
But deliver part of your report as 
an
 interim
report, allowing time for Government to complete its
internal discussions on the compensation scheme
framework, incidentally allowing time for 
an
 answer from
the Department of Health to your question about what it
has apologised for.
 
84
The advantage of taking such 
a
 course
, 
splitting
essentially the report into 
a
 main report with its
conclusions
, 
find
ings
 and its main recommendations --
the answer that would be provided would be the retention
of your powers under the Act
, 
so that you could then
, 
if
required
 
and if necessary
, 
call for evidence from
whoever at that time might be the minister in charge or
to recall Sir Robert to answer questions as to the
viability and acceptability of the Government's response
and proposals as regards compensation.
After all
, 
sir, as we have seen very recently, not
following report recommendations is hardly 
a
 new sport.
We note the recent news and discussions about the
Hillsborough report and the Home Secretary, Suella
Braverman has recently reneged on the Government's
commitments given in the light of the Windrush report
recommendations
.
Sir
, 
we make these submissions and we find support
for this way ahead in the terms of reference
 -- 
always
useful
 -- 
treatment care and support, number 8 of the
terms of reference.  This Inquiry is bound to consider
the nature and adequacy of the treatment care and
support
, 
including financial assistance provided to
people who are infected and affected
, 
including the
bereaved
.
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  85
Sir
, 
to achieve finality and to achieve what I have
discussed by way of the way forward, you may find that
that paragraph would 
assist
 you in considering 
a
 split
way of providing 
a
 report, to give Government the
understanding of your find
ings
, your consideration of
evidence, while leaving open also the ability to
consider the way the Government responds
.
In our submission
, 
this Inquiry will not have
fulfilled its terms of reference
, 
with the greatest of
respect
, 
until such time it has been established what
the Government will do in terms of financial provision
for the infected and affected going forwards.  The
Department of Health's evasive closing submissions lend
,
we suggest
, 
special weight to the necessity to continue
to apply scrutiny to the action of Government in this
regard.
Before I set out my final and very short concluding
remarks
, 
let me use this platform to send 
a
 message to
the Labour Party
.
Wes Streeting MP
 is Labour's Shadow Health and
Social Care Secretary and with
, 
Sir
 
Keir Starmer
, 
we
suggest that he and they must
, 
as
 
a
 matter of urgency
,
commit the next possible Government to the
implementation of the Inquiry recommendations and the
establishment of the compensation scheme.
 
86
We are
, 
sir
, 
all aware that the politics 
of 
the
moment are even more unstable than usual
, 
and 
that
 
is
saying
 
something
, 
but the victims and survivors of this
disaster must not be left to wonder whether 
a
 possible
future Labour government might hold up or stall the
development of the compensation scheme.
My final concluding remarks.  Sir
, 
I have to accept
that my request for peace is the hardest of goals.  But
many of those infected and affected simply want peace
and the ability
, 
as far as 
this 
can ever be achieved
, 
to
put this behind them and quietly get on with the
remainder of their lives.  We ask
, 
sir
, 
that you bear
this goal in 
mind
 when finalising your report.
But
, 
sir
, 
at least for now
, 
you get peace from me.
Thank you for listening.

--Result #229--

  
I should perhaps explain that the Chair's new
location is not 
because I'm 
about to start
cross-examining him
, sadly
.
I want to start by saying something about the
Inquiry's work over the last four and a half years
.  I'm
then
 going to say something
 -- 
a little about the
Inquiry's work after today because today is not the end
.
And finally I will make some observations about just
a
 few of the issues that have emerged from the oral and
written submissions that we have been considering over
the last few weeks
.
The events which gave rise to this Inquiry have
memorably been described as the worst treatment disaster
in the history of the National Health Service.  The
scope of this Inquiry has been unprecedented in what
I would suggest are four 
particular
 respects.
Firstly, as to the scale of the disaster.  The
number of those infected runs
,
 as we now know
,
 into 
tens
of thousands, many of whom have died.  And as we have
 
88
been powerfully reminded during the submissions
, 
not
least yesterday and this morning, people are continuing
to die in consequence of their treatment with infected
blood and infected blood products
.
Secondly, the Inquiry's scope is unprecedented in
terms of its geographical scope, covering all four
nations within the UK
, 
and giving rise
, 
as you have
heard this week
, 
to considerations about the
relationship between the UK government and Scotland
Wales and Northern Ireland both pre
 
and post-
d
evolution
.
Thirdly
, 
the scope of the Inquiry is unprecedented
in terms of its time frame
, 
exploring over five
 
decades
of knowledge, of decision-making, of action and of
inaction.
Then the fourth respect is this, most Inquiries
examine
 
a
 catastrophic event and the circumstances
,
which may often be complex
, 
which lead up to that event.
This Inquiry's terms of reference have required it to
consider the response of government, the NHS and others
in the decades following the transmission of infection.
Mr Dawson KC yesterday talked about the way in which
the harms caused by infection and treatment have been
,
and I quote from his submissions
, "
irrevocably 
and
multiply
 
compounded and 
increased by the way the state
has reacted
", and 
he described the compounding of the
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  89
harm 
as a unique and important element of the disaster
which you
,
 sir
,
 will have to consider
.
It is important that the wider public and the media
understand that this is not simply 
an
 inquiry into
matters of history.  This is 
an
 inquiry into, as
Mr Williams
 
KC put it on Wednesday, the here and now.
It is 
an
 inquiry with ongoing relevance and resonance to
decision-making by government and the NHS today.
In the last ten days
, 
three reports have been
published.
On 24 January the Committee on Standards in Public
Life published the report that its Chair,
Lord
 
Jonathan
 
Evans
, 
told us about when he gave evidence
to this Inquiry in November.  That report is about the
need for active work to ensure that the ethical values
reflected in the Nolan Principles become the cultural
norm for those in public life.  The inference 
being
 that
there is still more work to be done in that regard
.  
And
you may think one only has to read the news to believe
that to be the case.
The second report published this week is the report
from the College of Policing and the National Police
Chiefs' Council
, 
entitled 
The National Police Response
to the Hillsborough Disaster.
  It is 
a
 response to
Bishop Jones' report
, 
about which you have heard 
a
 lot
 
90
in recent weeks
, 
his report entitled 
The patronising
disposition of unaccountable power
.  
And that police
report accepts that those who lead must acknowledge when
mistakes have been made and must not seek to defend the
indefensible.
The third report
 
just published
 
is 
a
 report from the
Patient Safety Commissioner for England, Dr Henrietta
Hughes
.  
She's just reported on her first 
100
 days in
post.  It makes depressing reading.  She says this:
"Over my first 
100
 days in the role
 
I have heard
a
 yearning desire for patient safety to be at the top of
the agenda
.  
It is clear from what they told me that the
focus on the Health Service is on productivity,
operational performance and financial control."
She said this
, 
and this is 
a
 sentence 
which 
I think
will resonate with all of you
, "
Medicine is
industrialised when it needs to be humanised
"
.
She said also this, worryingly
: 
"
It is clear that the culture is getting worse and
un
less leader
s
 set 
a
 strategic intention to listen and
act we are heading straight back to the days of Mid
Staffs and other health scandals
, 
severe harm and
death
.
"
Turning then to the Inquiry's work.  
In order to
fulfil its wide terms of reference the Inquiry has had
 
91
to gather 
a
 vast amount of material.  It has had to
obtain, sift and analyse contemporaneous documentation
from 
a
 wide variety of sources and then use that
documentation to obtain statements from 
a
 large number
of witnesses.
It is only right that I should acknowledge that the
Inquiry has had extensive co-operation from Core
Participants and their legal representatives and
I should say that has included the Department of Health
and Social Care.  We are grateful for the amount of work
that's been devoted by witnesses to the task of engaging
with and responding to the Inquiry's requests for
documents and statements.
A
 few facts and figures then about the Inquiry's
work.  The number of documents disclosed to Core
Participants is
, 
I am reliably informed
, 
over 100,000,
comprising over 
0.75
 million pages of material.  We have
received over 4,000 statements from those infected and
affected.  We have received well over 1,000
 -- 
I think
the precise figure
, 
in fact
, 
is 1,200
 -- 
statements from
other witnesses
, 
from doctors, politicians, civil
servants, those involved in the Alliance House
Organisations, those working for pharmaceutical
companies
, 
and so on.
We have obtained material reports from 
seven
 
92
different expert groups and I will refer to some of
those in the course of my address.  The Inquiry has
heard orally from 370 witnesses and has sat hearing
evidence and submissions for 286
 
days
, 
including today.
I hope you don't 
mind
 if I give you 
a
 quick recap of
what we have covered in the oral hearings.
Following the preliminary hearings in September 2018
at Church House in Westminster, we heard the evidence of
people who were infected and affected, starting in
London at the end of April 2019, we then moved to
Belfast, to 
Leeds
, to Edinburgh and Cardiff and then
again sat in London in October 2019
.
In February 2020
, 
the Inquiry heard from the
intermediaries who were able to tell us about the
experiences of those who had not felt able to give
witness statements to the Inquiry but who wanted their
story nevertheless to be heard.  We heard from clinical
experts in relation to hepatitis, HIV and on bleeding
and blood disorders
, 
and we heard from the psychosocial
expert panel.  Mr Dawson told you yesterday of the
importance of that evidence from his clients'
perspective
.
That evidence helped all of us understand the
multiple and profound ways in which lives have been
impacted above and beyond the devastating direct

  93
consequences of infection and treatment.  I just want to
read one short passage from the evidence of the
psychosocial experts.  It was on 24 February 2020 and it
is page 150 of the transcript.
The question which I put was as follows:
"
One 
particular
 feature from the evidence that the
Inquiry has heard is that for many people their whole
lives have become defined by the condition with which
they were infected and treatment for it, for symptoms
and so on.  But the result is that they have had 
to 
live
a
 life 
completely 
different from the life that they
would otherwise have expected to and they have lost
opportunities, been unable to fulfil 
a
 potential that
would other
wise 
have been there.  How does that bear
upon the
ir 
psychological experience?"
This was Professor Weinman's answer:
"Hugely
, 
because
 [
he said
]
 going back to what I said
earlier about one's sense of self
, one's 
sense of self
identity
, 
I think some people have said
, 
you know
, 
if
you think of illness as 
a
 
sort of 
set of things and
one's self as 
a
 set of things, for some people
, 
you
know
, 
the sense of one's self can be completely
obliterated because day to day this is what's happening
to you.  There is nothing else.  So those multiple
selves, one's future 
selves
, all those 
really 
important
 
94
dimensions become pretty well wiped out
.  
"
That
 
is
 from 
an
 experiential point of view 
but 
also
in terms of 
people's aspirations absolutely devastating.
The idea of having
, you know, 
no obvious future or
incredibly uncertain future which is completely dictated
by this thing 
which 
now defines you is massively
impactful."
Sir
, 
I know the psychosocial evidence will be hugely
valuable to you 
in your work of 
addressing part 4 of the
terms of reference
.
Returning to the oral hearings, it had been the
Inquiry's plan to start hearing from haemophilia
clinicians in the summer of 2020 but as we all know
events took a different course 
and the pandemic
intervened.  That led to those hearings 
being
 deferred
to September 2020 but
, 
since that time
, 
the Inquiry has
managed to continue to conduct its
 
hearings
,
notwithstanding the constraints imposed by Covid-19
.
The September 2020 hearings began with the evidence
of Lord David Owen.  His important evidence was then
followed by 
an
 examination of medical and other
literature
, 
so as to analyse and importantly expose to
public scrutiny what was actually known and what could
or should have been known about the risks of viral
transmission at the relevant times
.
 
95
We also began the first of 
a
 series of
presentations.  We started looking at the work of
Professor Arthur Bloom, the Cardiff Haemophilia Centre
and the Oxford Haemophilia Centre.  Such presentation
s
are not a normal feature of the way in which public
inquiries normally hold their hearings 
but it had seemed
to us important where there was no living witness that
the key facts and documents should be examined in
a
 public domain for all to hear
.
We 
heard 
the first of 
a
 number of haemophilia
clinicians start
ing
 in October 2020 with the evidence of
Dr Mark Winter.  We heard from 
a
 number of other
clinicians over the following months and
, 
where we were
not able to call key doctors
, 
we continued to 
examine
the contemporaneous documentation in the presentations
.
We heard from the expert panel of medical ethicists
in January 2021.  I will come back to their evidence
but, 
again
, 
it is hugely important evidence from the
Inquiry's perspective
.
We heard from Mr Watters of The Haemophilia Society
and evidence from those involved in the Alliance House
Organisations through February and March 2021.  In
May 2021 we heard from Health Ministers in each of the
four nations
, 
together with those involved in the
current financial support schemes
.
 
96
I am sure you will all recall Mr Matthew Hancock
,
then Secretary of State for Health
, 
accepting moral
responsibility on the Government to address the impact
of what happened to you.  He said this too:
"Should substantial compensation be the outcome of
this Inquiry, then we
 [
the Government
]
 will provide it."
In June 2021
, 
having heard further evidence about
The Haemophilia Society, we heard evidence from
campaigners and we examined and called evidence in
relation to Treloar's.  I do not think I am
, 
in any
sense
, 
prejudging the conclusions you reached
, 
sir
, 
when
I observed that the evidence 
that 
we examined and heard
in relation to Treloar's was truly shocking
.
In July 2021
, 
we heard the first of our government
witnesses, civil servants and politicians, Dr Diana
Walford
, 
Lord Glenarthur and
, 
memorably
, 
Lord Clarke.
I am sure you will 
all understand when I say 
I am
unlikely ever to forget the experience of questioning
the latter
.
In September 2021 we heard the evidence of Lord
Fowler
, 
which you may think set 
a
 rather different tone.
Then between September and November 2021, 
we examined
the actions and roles of pharmaceutical companies,
largely through presentations and analysis of the
contemporaneous documentation but we heard also from
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  97
Christopher Bishop
, 
an
 employee of Armour
.
In November 2021 the Inquiry turned its forensic
lens on the Blood Transfusion Services and that work
continued into February 2022.  As well as presentations
on the organisational structures and history of the
blood transfusion services, we examined the work of
Dr Gunson and Professor Cash.  We were able to hear from
a
 number of surviving Regional Transfusion Directors,
fortunately this was 
an
 area in which we were able to
hear directly from those involved in Wales and Northern
Ireland
, 
which has not always been the case
.
That phase culminated in the evidence of Dr Lloyd
the Newcastle Regional Transfusion Director
.  
You will
recall no doubt that in 1991 he had been vilified for
having the temerity to introduce hepatitis C screening
ahead of other Regional Transfusion Directors
.
In February 2022
, 
we undertook the vitally important
task of examining blood transfusion policies and
practices through presentations and witnesses.
We moved in March 2022 to consideration of
self-sufficiency, domestic production and viral
inactivation, hearing from Drs Foster, Snape and 
Perry
.
In May 2022 we returned to government decision
making, mostly hearing from witnesses from England and
Scotland, 
a
 range of civil servants and politicians,
 
98
predominantly Health Ministers but also 
a
 former Prime
Minister, John Major
.
That took us to the end of July 2022 but 
of course,
also in the course of July 2022
, 
we heard the evidence
of Sir Robert Francis, nearly 
seven
 months 
ago
 now
.
Following further government evidence in September
2022
, 
the Inquiry hearings moved into their last phases
.
Between September and October we returned to the vitally
important exercise of hearing from those infected and
affected directly.
We heard expert evidence from the public health and
administration group, evidence from Professor Richard
Tedder and then
, 
in November
, 
we moved into two weeks of
evidence relevant to recommendations, covering 
a
 wide
range of issues and culminating with the evidence of
Professor
 
Sir Jonathan Van-Tam
.
Three short observations about the oral hearings.
First, I must emphasise that whilst the Inquiry has
heard orally from 
a
 significant number of the infected
and affected community, there are many more who did not
give oral evidence but who have provided written
statement
s
 
to
 the Inquiry.  Their evidence is just as
important
 -- 
and I know you
,
 sir
,
 have faithfully read
those statements.
Secondly, we must not and do not forget those who
 
99
have died
 
and whose testimonies we have never been able
to gather
, 
those who have been infected but who have for
perfectly understandable reasons not felt able to
participate in the Inquiry, no doubt in part because of
their experiences of stigma and trauma
, 
and those who
may have lived and died unaware of their infection as
a result of blood transfusion.
Thirdly, in relation to the oral hearings, there are
key individuals from government, from the medical
profession, from pharmaceutical companies and elsewhere,
from whom the Inquiry has not been able to obtain
statements either because they are dead or because of
impairments of health and age.  Bloom, Gunson, Cash,
Lane, Forbes, Willoughby
, 
Galbraith, Acheson
; 
those are
some of the names that came to 
mind
.
Had this Inquiry been heard in the 1990s most
 -- 
not
all 
but most -- 
of those would have been able to give
evidence.  However
, 
notwithstanding that disadvantage
,
we have
,
 we think
,
 been able to gather and shine
a
 forensic light on sufficient of the contemporaneous
documentation to enable you
,
 sir
,
 to answer the terms of
reference comprehensively
.
If I turn briefly to the Inquiry's ongoing work
.
The oral hearings come to 
an
 end today but the work of
the Inquiry continues.  That burden will fall largely on
 
100
you
,
 sir
,
 and I know you will shortly provide some
further information in that regard
.  
I won't try 
to
steal your thunder
.
There are some witness statements still 
being
received
, 
and hence there will be some continuing
disclosure of documents and statements to Core
Participants, as well as 
a
 process 
of
 publication of
a
 large amount of material on the Inquiry's website.
It is very much now 
an
 exercise of crossing
 
t's and
dotting
 
i's
, 
filling in very small pieces of 
the 
jigsaw
,
and we do not expect the material that we are continuing
to receive to be likely to alter any of the submissions
that have been made
.
If
,
 however
,
 there are any 
particular
 significant
statements
, 
I undertake to flag that up to recognised
legal representatives
, 
and
 
if they wish to add to their
written submissions, 
they
 can, 
where the Chair considers
it would be helpful, 
be facilitated
.
I want to turn then to some observations relating to
issues that have arisen in the course of the submissions
hearings.  But I'm going to preface them with 
a
 general
observation.
Section 2.1 of the Inquiries Act precludes the Chair
from ruling on or determining any person's criminal or
civil liability.  But section 2.2 provides that the
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  101
Chair is not inhibited in the discharge of his functions
by any likelihood of liability 
being
 averred from the
facts he determines or the recommendations he makes.
What that means
,
 sir
,
 is you are free to criticise.
You are free to say that wrong was done and to
particularise
, 
if this is where the evidence leads you
,
the respects in which you consider wrong was done
.
You are free to say that governments or clinicians
or NHS bodies or pharmaceutical companies acted
unreasonably, or unethically, or unconscionably or
failed to act when they should.
With that in 
mind
, 
can I then address three points
that have arisen out of these submissions.  The first is
the nature of the obligation owed by the state or the
government to its citizens
.
Although the Chair is not empowered to determine
questions of legal liability
, 
as I have said, he is
entitled to consider the nature and extent of the
state's obligations and responsibilities to its
citizens
, 
and that may provide a useful backdrop to
an
 analysis of what happened and why.
Core Participants 
in
 their submissions have
identified three sources of obligations and
responsibilities.  The first are international and
human rights
 
conventions and instruments.  They are
 
102
discussed in some detail in Mr Snowden's written
submissions and in Ms Monaghan's written and oral
submissions
, 
and I don't propose to repeat them.
There is only one additional matter which I flag up.
Ms Monaghan
, 
in paragraphs 30 to 31 of her written
submissions
, 
described one 
particular
 protective
obligation under Article 2 of the European Convention,
that's the obligation to protect life.
The obligation she described arose from 
a
 decision
of the European Court of Human Rights in 
a
 case called
O
s
man
.  
It is 
an
 obligation often referred to as the
operational obligation.
But there is 
a
 separate and additional obligation
under Article 2 that you
,
 sir
,
 may wish to consider.  It
is referred to in the case law of the European Court of
Human Rights as 
a
 systemic obligation.  It is 
a
 duty to
make regulations compelling hospitals to adopt
appropriate measures for the protection of patients'
lives
, 
a
 duty to have effective administrative and
regulatory systems in place
, 
and 
a
 duty which
encompasses necessary measures to ensure the effective
functioning of the regulatory framework, including by
way of superficial and enforcement
.
You may think that those formulations of the state's
duty to protect life have 
a
 
particular
 resonance to this
 
103
Inquiry's work.
One other source of responsibilities and duties
identified by Core Participants in their submissions are
domestic, legal duties
.  
Mr Snowden's submissions take
you
,
 sir
,
 to the National Health Service Act of 1946,
1977 and 2006.  I don't propose to rehearse those.  But
you will no doubt need also to consider the position in
relation to Scotland and Northern Ireland because those
Acts cover England and Wales.
But the third source of state responsibility is what
might be characterised the moral duty.  Lord
 
David
 
Owen
when he gave evidence from his perspective as 
a
 Health
Minister in the 1970s
 -- 
and his evidence was given on
22 September 2020
 -- 
was asked this by you
, 
sir
: 
"
As 
a
 matter of principle
, 
do you see it as one of
the first duties of the state to look after the safety
of its population?
"Answer:
  
Yes
.
"Question:
  
So that would extend to the safety of
patients receiving blood 
or 
blood products
?
"Answer:
  
Yes
.
"
Exactly one year later
, 
on the second day of his
oral evidence
, 
Lord Fowler was asked 
a
 similar question
by the Chair
:
"Question:
  
Would your standpoint have been that
 
104
keeping the public safe is one of the first if not the
first duty of government?
"Answer:
  
I think it is the fist duty of government
and so I would take public health as 
being
 the first
.
"Question:
  
And therefore everything ought to 
depend
first of all upon does this protect or help protect the
safety of the public?
"Answer:
  
Exactly."
Then Andy Burnham
, 
who gave evidence in July 202
2
,
was asked about his own words in 
a
 document called
Glaziers and window breakers
.  The reference for the
transcript, it doesn't need to go up, is RLIT0001140.
It is 
a
 document that gathers together the reflections
of 
a
 number of former Secretaries of State.  Mr Burnham
in that document had said this
, 
about the job of 
being
Secretary of State for Health:
"The job
, 
as I see it
, 
is to get the best possible
health
 
care, the safest, highest quality health care for
the people of England and to protect them from health
risks."
In his oral evidence to this Inquiry he said he
would absolutely stand by that
.
Moving 
then 
to 
a 
second issue emerg
ing
 from the
submissions 
that have been 
made by Core Participants.
You have heard about hindsight and you have heard
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  105
warnings about the risk of hindsight bias.  It has been
suggested that the decisions and actions should be
assessed
, 
at least in the 
first
 
instance
, 
by the
standards and norms of behaviour or conduct at the time.
That's 
a
 suggestion not limited to the Department of
Health and Social Care but you will see it also in the
submissions 
of 
NHSBT, 
the Belfast Health and Social Care
Trust 
and others
.
There are two points I would like to make in
relation to that.  Firstly, something may be done in
accordance with the standards and norms of the time and
yet be wrong.  
A
 stark historical example but one that
was referred to by the medical
 
ethicists 
during 
their
evidence 
is slavery.  You
, 
sir
, 
are not limited 
to
assessing decisions 
by reference to the standards or
norms at the time.  You are entitled to say that what
was done was wrong
, 
if 
that
 
is
 where the evidence takes
you
.
You are entitled to sa
id
 
indeed 
that the standards
and norms themselves were wrong.  The medical ethicists
said this in their oral evidence:
"And in medicine as in many other spheres of life we
can see examples of practices and behaviours that
 
at one
particular
 point
 
were deemed acceptable but subsequently
with further thinking sometimes
, 
and it is just with
 
106
further thinking
, 
it becomes clear that those are just
not acceptable and were actually never acceptable."
You may recall
, 
sir
, 
that I suggested to the
ethicists that context
 
and history might help us
understand why something happened, why 
a
 practice took
place but wouldn't necessarily provide 
a
 justification
or excuse of that practice having taken place.
Professor 
Savulescu
 said
: 
"
That's exactly right.  There is 
a
 distinction
between two kinds of reasons
, 
explanatory reasons and
justificat
o
ry or normative reasons."
So, 
for
 
example
 
a
 culture of paternalism or 
a
 dearth
of guidance from the Chief Medical Officer or the
General
 
Medical Council might be 
an
 explanatory reason,
it might help explain why something was done the way it
was, but that doesn't mean that it is necessarily
a
 justificatory or norm
ative
 one
.
The second point in relation to this issue about
hindsight and standards and norms of behaviour at the
time
 -- 
and this was alluded to by Mr Dawson
yesterday
 -- 
there is evidence before you
, 
sir
, 
that
some of the ideas, principles or ethical norms 
that are
most relevant to this Inquiry have
, 
in fact
, 
been
incredibly stable across time.  I want to take three
categories of people whose actions fall to be assessed
 
107
and judged in this Inquiry
: 
clinicians, civil servants
and politicians
.
In relation
s
 
to
 clinicians, the medical ethicists
told us about fundamental moral principles or values
that were stable and consistent across time.  They told
us by reference to 
a
 1979 publication, Principles of
Biomedical Ethics about four principles, autonomy
;
justice
; 
beneficence, in other words the imperative to
do good
; 
and non-maleficence
, 
do no harm
.
The ethicists agree that 
a
 basic and fundamental
principle of clinical practice is that 
an
 adult with
capacity should not be subject to medical intervention
unless they had given 
a
 valid and informed consent.
Their evidence explained that the philosophical basis
for the idea of informed consent is patient autonomy
.
That is not 
a
 new idea.  There was 
a
 discussion in the
ethicist's evidence about the 18th century philosopher
,
Immanuel Kant
, and Professor Savulescu said this in his
evidence on 26 January 
2021
, 
referring to Kant's
categorical imperatives of 
autonomy and rationality.  He
said this:
"Because human beings have autonomy and 
they have
rationality, you should always treat human beings as
an
 end and never 
merely 
as 
a
 means
, 
and how you treat
somebody as 
an
 end is essentially if you get their
 
108
informed consent
, 
in 
a
 nutshell.  So when they
understand what you are proposing and freely agree to
it, you are treating them as 
an
 end.  When you don't do
that, you are treating them as 
a
 means.  That's what's
so important about obtaining informed consent
, 
is that
you are then treating the patient as 
an
 end in
themselves and not merely as 
a
 means to something else.
"
The ethicists also told us about the importance of
a
 series of lectures given by Professor Sir Ian Kennedy
in 1980, the Reith Lectures
, 
Unmask
ing 
Medicine
.  It is
just one of those lectures I want to put up on screen.
RLIT0000
620, "
Reith Lectures 1980: Unmasking
Medicine.  Ian Kennedy Lecture 4: If I were you
, Mrs B".
Professor Kennedy said this:
"It would normally be accepted 
that
 ethical
principles, the principles by reference to which we
organise our lives and decide what we ought or ought not
to do
, 
are not the preserve of any one group.  But the
doctor may reply that, yes, he does make ethical
decisions, but these are medical ethics things and so
they are properly for doctors alone.  This would suggest
that there is 
a
 realm of ethics unique to medicine and
within the unique competence of doctors to determine and
apply.  My response is that medical ethics are not
separate from but part of the general moral and ethical
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  109
order by which we 
live
.  Decisions as to what the doctor
ought to do must therefore be tested against the ethical
principles of the society.  He has no special
dispensation to depart from our moral and ethical order.
It must be wrong that 
a
 doctor, by describing 
a
 decision
as medical, can claim unique competence to make such 
an
decision, even if it touches the basic values by which
we
 live our lives."
Then
 we can go
, please, 
to page 3, 
Lawrence, 
second
and third paragraphs.
Professor Kennedy said this:
"Another rationalisation resorted to is the
so-called therapeutic privilege.  This suggests that, as
a
 matter of good medical practice, circumstances exist
in which the doctor may withhold information from his
patient
, 
if
 
in the exercise of his discretion and
judgment it wouldn't be in the best interests of the
patient's health to know.  This is clearly 
a
 device
created by doctors to do what is in the best interests
of doctors.  It may be justified on some occasions but
there is no effort to specify these occasions.
Everything proceeds on the basis of the 
particular
doctor's judgment.  It all boils down to the doctor
being
 good, gentle and kind.  It would be nice if all
our doctors were like this.  But
, 
just in case, can't we
 
110
have some more certain guarantees that our interests
, 
as
defined by us, may be allowed to pr
evail
?  The device of
the therapeutic privilege pays lip
-
service to the
principles of truth
-
telling and self
-
determination,
while it creates 
a
 discretionary exception which is
quite capable of swallowing these principles when the
doctor decides the occasion requires it.
"If we look beneath these rationalisations we see
an
 ethical principle which is certainly not part of
received tradition in analysing the doctor
-
patient
relationship.  The traditional view is that the
doctor
-
patient relationship rests on trust or at least
on agreement
.  
But what we see is an operational
principle defined by the doctor and accepted by us by
default
, 
which allows the doctor to suspend the trust or
rewrite the agreement when in his view this is
appropriate.  Of course, if the patient breaks his trust
or violates the agreement, there may be dire
consequences for him
, 
even to the extent of his
forfeiting further care.  Not so the doctor
.  
He remains
arbiter of the relationship
, 
even to the extent of
claiming the privilege of resort to an operational
principle which is the precise opposite of traditional
ethics."
Then this last sentence:
 
111
"For
, 
it is 
a
 basic moral principle of our society
that we should tell the truth."
Those then are some of the standards and norms of
the time relevant to 
an
 assessment of the actions of
clinicians.
Turning more briefly to civil servants, the Public
Health 
&
 Administration Group told us that the Civil
Service attributes of integrity, honesty, objectivity
and impartiality form the bedrock upon which the Civil
Service was built
.  
And 
that 
whilst those values were
not enshrined in statute until 2010
, 
the Civil Service
had been firmly based on them for at least the last
160 years
.
So no need for hindsight in order to understand the
values and norms which should guide the behaviour of
civil servants.
Likewise, in relation to politicians, the same
Public Health & Administration Expert Group enabled us
to explore the Nolan Principles, the seven principles of
public life.  You will recall they are
: 
selflessness,
integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness,
honesty and leadership
.  
And although those were first
formally published as such in May 1995, the experts told
us that they were the principles that had long
underpinned the spirit of public service in this
 
112
country
.
So
, 
put shortly, the civil servants and politicians
whose decisions and actions you
,
 sir
,
 will need to
consider were always expected to act with objectivity
,
with integrity and with honesty
.
The third issue that I want to say something about
relates to the submissions that have been made about the
position adopted by some of the public body
Core Participants, most notably but not uniquely the
Department of Health and Social Care
.
Much has already been said by
, 
amongst others
,
Ms Gollop
 
KC, Ms Jones, Mr Williams
 
KC and Mr 
Stein 
KC.
You have heard in the submission
s 
of Mr Bowie 
for
 the
Scottish 
National 
Blood Transfusion
 Service 
and 
the
Scottish Territorial Health Boards 
that
 it is 
indeed
possible for 
a
 public body to engage even 
at
 this late
stage in 
a
 
valuable process of critical self analysis
.
As to the Department of Health not having 
a
 position
or 
a
 case
, 
Ms Grey was of course right when she said
there is no compulsion on 
a
 Core Participant to
formulate 
a
 case before 
a
 public inquiry.  There is
nothing in the Inquir
ies 
Act or 
Inquiry 
Rules that
compel that.  But one may ask the question
: 
if 
a
 public
Inquiry is not the place for candour
, 
what is?
For years
,
 of course
,
 the Department of Health and
 

3 February 2023
                                                             
                         

  113
government and 
indeed
 the Devolved Administrations have
promulgated positions and views
.  
We have examined some
of them.  The phrases are familiar to you all: no
conclusive proof, best available treatment, no fault,
inadvertence
.
You
,
 sir
,
 may wish to consider the fact that the
Department of Health and government have 
felt
 able to
take 
a
 position to advance 
a
 case 
previously on the
basis of what might be said to be a
 limited
understanding of the 
underlying facts
, 
but now
, 
when so
much more is known
, 
it has not done so
.  
But 
that
 
is
,
 of
course
,
 ultimately 
a
 matter for you
.
I have already referenced Mr Williams' observation
that this is 
an
 Inquiry looking into the here and now.
The position adopted by any 
public
 body
, 
and
a 
disinclination
,
 
for example, 
therefore
,
 to answer the
questions posed 
of
 the Department by Mr 
Snowden
 on the
first day of those submissions
, 
is 
itself 
a
 matter 
that
you would be entitled to consider if you wish
,
 sir
,
 as
part of your assessment of the response 
of
 government
under the Inquiry's terms of reference
.
The other point to bear in 
mind
 about the situation
of public bodies not engaging in the process of critical
self analysis is 
a
 point 
that was 
made powerfully by
Mr Dawson yesterday.  He referred to the psychosocial
 
114
evidence and the evidence that 
a
 lack of apology, 
a
 lack
of explanation can itself cause further harm
.
The psychosocial group told us how that can lead to
health care becoming compromised because patients avoid
going back into the health care system.  They told us
people can become stuck with anger, that they can't move
on with their 
lives
 because nobody has acknowledged or
taken responsibility for what has happened to them.
So one further question you
,
 sir
,
 will be entitled
to consider as part of your analysis if you choose
, 
in
terms of analysing the response of government
, 
is
whether the 
stance 
of public bodies on 
an
 ongoing basis
has 
compounded or
 continues to compound that harm
.
In that respect
, 
it may be instructive to note that
whilst the Department might not wish to take 
a
 position,
some of the witnesses who they have supported to give
evidence have done so.  Some of course have accepted
where things went wrong.  Mr Burnham gave evidence in
very powerful terms 
in 
that respect.
By contrast
,
 however
,
 we have the view of
Lord Clarke in his evidence on 27 July 2021
, 
if I may be
for
given for quoting:
"I 
don't think the Department did anything wrong.
I've never heard anybody suggest anything that in the
real world a minister or a civil servant might have done
 
115
that would have prevented it.  I've already said, had we
taken the step we now know would have saved lives we'd
have been treated with outrage by the Haemophilia
Society and most haemophiliacs by denying them their
Factor VIII.  There just wasn't the evidence 
to suggest
that.
"
I 
don't
 think the Department did anything wrong
,
I 
don't
 think there was anything the Department could
have done that it didn't do.  It
's
 the current way 
of
the life now.  It's part of the current political scene,
that somebody has got to be summonsed, to use the old
saying.  Someone has got to be found to be blamed for
this, and it's all the fault of the Government, really.
Or 
sometimes it's
 all the fault of the Tory party
; it
depends who is in power at the time.  I don't think we
did 
anything really wrong."
Sir, you wanted the evidence which this Inquiry has
heard to begin and end with the accounts of those
infected and affected.  I am going to end by reminding
everyone about 
a
 
particular
 piece of evidence that was
heard during the course of the Inquiry hearing on
8 May 2019.  The reason why I am going to do so I will
explain after I have summarised the evidence
.
On that day 
an
 anonymous witness, Mrs C, gave
evidence about her son S.  It was the first time she had
 
116
ever spoken about these events beyond her immediate
family.  S was born in 1978.  He had haemophilia 
--Result #230--
 Yes, if I may. 
I'd like to thank, first of all, Sir Brian and 
to the Inquiry.  Thank you for letting the victims and 
families talk.  It's something we've not been able to 
do for decades.  To live in our world, in our 
community, in silence for so long because we're sca red 
of basically what people think, what loved ones thi nk, 
people, friends.  But we sort of work together.  We
had that bond together and I'd just like to say tha nk 
you for everyone giving their statements because it
takes an awful lot of courage, it really does. 
I've met some amazing people in the campaign 
groups.  I mean, they're incredible people.  These 
people are like brothers and sisters to me and that 's 
what we're like.  We're like a band of brothers and
sisters against something that should never have 
happened.  It should never have happened. 
When you look at how we got infected and you      111 look at the mistakes that were made, the whole 
political ideology, if I can put it that way, which
led to the disaster, where self-sufficiency produci ng 
Factor VIII and clotting factor from UK-sourced blo od,
those plans were scrapped again because of one thin g:
because of money.  And money has been at the heart of 
the disaster.  It's why it's never, ever been 
resolved. 
I would just like to quickly quote something. 
This is from a book written by Simon Garfield, an 
extract from a book called The End of Innocence.  H e 
attributes this to Edwina Currie: 
"Because there are a lot of them and it was 
expensive.  Simple as that.  It is not Government 
policy to compensate people who are the subject of 
medical accidents.  We looked very seriously at 
compensation possibilities to avoid poor souls havi ng 
to take cases to court.  But the cost of doing it w as 
horrendous because compensation usually in this 
country takes into account loss of earning power an d 
potential length of life.  So you're talking about 
settlements of 1 million.  Another less public 
argument received much support at the Department of
Health.  Payments would have gone to people who ain 't 
going to get better, whose medical circumstances ar e      112 not going to improve, Currie says.  Many of the mor e 
recent compensation cases will pay money during the
individual's lifetime rather than a lump sum but th e 
practice then firmly was to give a lump sum based o n 
a calculation and then your haemophilia patient mig ht 
die three weeks later and, hey presto, you've got 
a very wealthy family.  They haven't got haemophili a,
they haven't got AIDS but they've got a million qui d 
of public money which could have been used to help 
treat other patients.  And on the whole that contin ued 
to be my feeling.  If people are hurt inevitably by
treatment that in fact has made their lives better,
it's awfully difficult to see where the legal posit ion 
might lie."
I think that just sums up why not just this 
present Government but previous governments have no t 
looked at it.  It has all been down to money.  It's
all been down to political people held responsible for 
what they did. 
It's also the pharmaceutical companies.  1970s, 
1980s Cutter was the biggest producers of Factor VI II 
and Factor IX in the world.  Bayer, as I know now,
basically took over Cutter.  They have 
a responsibility, as well as the other pharmaceutic al 
companies, as well as the Government, to do somethi ng      113 now. 
What really worries me is we had over 107 people 
die so far since the Inquiry was announced back in 
Parliament in 2017.  More people are going to die b y 
the end of this Inquiry.  That's going to happen an d I 
know that plays on everyone's mind in this room.  A nd 
we have a duty -- we have a duty -- to those people
who aren't going to be here by the end of the Inqui ry 
to do the right thing and do the right thing now.  
And I think that the Government need to realise 
that.  We need to stop the games because there's be en 
a lot of games trying to get the Department of Heal th,
for example, off at the Inquiry has been -- it's be en 
awful how the games that they have played and the 
people -- they just don't seem to care and I think 
I can say that throughout the whole of the disaster , 
that people don't seem to care from Government 
officials, pharmaceutical companies, even some 
haematologists.  
And that's the thing with the tragedy.  It's 
just been a -- and still going on.  The disaster is
still happening.  It's not it's over 30 or 40 years
ago.  It's still happening right now.  It is up to the 
Government to say enough's enough and do the right 
thing.  People have suffered for too long and it's      114 been -- and just do the right thing in society beca use 
we owe it to the people we've lost, we owe it to th e 
ones who are alive, and we owe it to generations so
this never, ever happens again because it could hap pen 
again.  We have pharmaceutical companies -- again,
profits are more important than people's lives. 
The people who died, if you hear all the 
figures, and it's the numbers.  These aren't just 
numbers.  They're people.  They are real lives, rea l 
families destroyed, smashed to pieces.  It was 
genocide total genocide.  
We deserve to have the people who have questions 
to answer to appear in front of the Inquiry, not to
write letters, not to try and dodge out of things, not 
to try and say the same old thing, "Oh, there's 
nothing else we could have done" because the people
we've lost deserve answers.  The families deserve 
answers.  We deserve answers so, as I say, it never
happens again. 
I just wanted to quickly say this about this 
form which is the EIBSS form for funding for certai n 
things for people who are infected.  The thing that
I could not believe when I saw this is to apply for
a funeral prepayment plan payment, the applicant mu st 
send this in: a completed discretionary one-off      115 payment application form and a quote for the 
prepayment funeral plan.  A quote for a pre-paid 
funeral plan.  It says here a copy of the funeral 
invoice or receipt. 
We're not talking about double glazing.  We're 
not talking about something that is trivial.  A wid ow 
gets that and has to go through that.  Haven't they
been through enough already?  There doesn't seem to  be 
any thought, there doesn't seem to be any humanity and 
that's the thing that was lost with what happened t o 
us.  Humanity lost in madness and chaos; as I say,
political ideology; pharmaceutical greed. 
There are people who have to answer for what 
happened no matter how difficult this is, they must
answer for what happened.  We cannot -- we cannot h ave 
closure until that happens, sir.  We cannot have 
closure until that happens.  We have lost too much and 
we're going to lose even more. 
This thing has consumed so many.  Even in the 
campaign, we lose people and we keep going and we l ose 
people, we keep going, people get ill, you don't se e 
them anymore.  It's just ... why would people in 
authority allow this to continue?  It's just wrong 
and, as I say, it's something that the Government 
needs to look at now and act on.      116 That's all I wanted to say.

--Result #231--
   Before we continue with this 
afternoon's evidence, I would like to say something  to 
those watching online.  I expect that many of you w ill 
have heard about this morning's statement by the 
Paymaster General, the Right Honourable Penny 
Mordaunt, MP.  You will recall that I first called for 
action to rectify the lack of parity and financial 
support for people infected and affected after the 
Inquiry's preliminary hearings.  When we started th e 
hearing of oral evidence I felt it was essential to
hear from people infected and affected in each nati on 
of the UK, because the impact of treatment with 
infected blood and blood products was felt in all 
corners of the UK. 
Today, I really welcome the commitment to bring 
the four national schemes into broader parity, to h elp 
to alleviate what I have described as the grinding 
hardship to which far too many people have been  
102 condemned through no fault of their own.
The statement also sets out the Government's 
intention to appoint an independent reviewer to car ry 
out a study looking at options for a framework for 
compensation to inform the Government's preparation s 
for what the Inquiry may recommend.
I want to reassure you that this is completely 
separate from the Inquiry, that it does not affect the 
Inquiry's Terms of Reference and that we will conti nue 
in our investigative work to get to the truth of wh at 
happened and, where recommendations are appropriate , 
to make them. 
I look forward to the announcement of who the 
independent reviewer is to be and expect that many of 
you will take great interest in their work. 
I anticipate that the Inquiry will want to hear fro m 
the reviewer once the proposals are published and t hat 
all Core Participants will have the opportunity to 
express their views to me on those proposals.
In the meantime, as I have said, our work 
continues. 
So, that said, we turn back to hear this 
afternoon's evidence. 
Ms Scott?

--Result #232--
 Yes.  I mean, again, just to say in my witness 
statement I sort of questioned that that was more o f 
a supposition about how DH would react than based o n 
any particular understanding because, although all 
appointments had to be approved by ministers, 
certainly, in practice, they were pretty much nodde d 
through. 
There was always the understanding that Caxton 
had not been set up as a campaigning group.  That w as 
something that I think was said to me pretty early on. 
I can't remember whether it was at the interview fo r 
the trustee role or whether it was on one of those  
142 early Board meetings, but there was a sort of very 
clear message from the founder trustees to those of  us 
who were new that Caxton was not there as 
a campaigning group, and that, you can argue, is bo rne 
out by the Trust Deed.
So to have somebody who was -- I think one of 
the -- the main issue, really, for me would be that , 
had we appointed somebody who was actively campaign ing 
against government policy, the issue would have bee n 
for them that, as a trustee, they would have been 
expected to have been, sort of, fully supportive of
the aims and objectives of the Caxton Foundation, a nd 
I would imagine that a campaigner would have found 
that rather difficult because part of the campaign was 
what shouldn't be happening is that people were 
expected to come cap in hand asking for charitable 
support from Caxton, that they should have 
compensation as an entitlement.  So with that point  of 
view, being a trustee of Caxton and campaigning for
a settlement might have put somebody in a difficult
position.

--Result #233--
   "Dr Jones phoned on 14 February to apologise 
for making so public his announcement about 
heat-treated Factor VIII being unsafe. 
"2.  Apparently the Haemophilia Society were 
kept informed and endorsed the content of his paper
which first was an attempt to obtain support for 
compensation of affected haemophiliacs.  Dr Jones 
admitted that he and the society, if indeed they we re 
party to this, had not thought through the conseque nt 
anxiety of haemophiliacs who had been, up until now ,
reassured about the safety of the heat-treated 
concentrate. 
"3.  Dr Jones emphasised that, whilst he 
accepted CMO's reprimand and agreed the departmenta l  
187 line, he knew there was strong evidence for the 
transmission of HTLV-III by the Armour heat-treated
Factor VIII used for treatment of a case in Holland . 
He had spoken at length with the doctor in charge o f 
this case.  The three American cases had been repor ted 
to CDC, he did not know if these were associated wi th 
Armour.  He believed that use of Armour heat-treate d 
Factor VIII in the UK should be reviewed." 
Then there are further matters set out by 
Dr Smithies on the issue.  We may be able to put it  on 
screen.  Let us see if this is the same one, there 
seems to be a lot of documents on this date. 
DHSC0002169.  I don't think it is that one.  We'll try 
it.

--Result #234--
 Oh, yes, very much so and, indeed, the financial 
plight it was introducing to people who couldn't wo rk, 
families whose father had died and they faced great
hardship and compensation certainly took over as 
a mainstream subject.  But no doubt we'll explore t hat 
later in the week.

--Result #235--
   Then if we go to page 25 of the book, which 
I think is probably page 27 electronically, Soumik,  we 
see this is the message from Dr Jones in the book: 
"Should I stop my haemophilia treatment? 
"No. 
"Bleeding causes more crippling and premature 
death in haemophilia than AIDS has or is ever likel y 
to do." 
Then he says in the next paragraph: 
"When the AIDS scare started doctors caring for 
haemophiliac families reassessed all forms of 
treatment available to them." 
Pausing there, sir, you will obviously wish to 
consider whether that correctly reflects the eviden ce 
that you have read and heard: 
"For a while there was a cut back in the use of 
concentrates." 
Again, sir, you will wish to consider whether  
112 you have seen evidence to support that:
"Naturally, some people with haemophilia were 
reluctant to treat themselves with what they saw as
a potentially dangerous blood product.  Companies i n 
the [US] reported a 20 per cent fall in blood produ ct 
consumption. 
"Once the dust settled fact began to impress 
itself again, and fact is that haemophilic bleeding
has to be treated.  However, modifications might be
made both to blood products and how they are used. 
These are described elsewhere." 
Then he goes on to talk about -- well, perhaps 
for the sake of completeness, we should go over the
page.  So the question is posed "Should I modify my
haemophilia treatment?"  He says: 
"You should certainly examine your treatment 
needs, or those of your child."  
There is then -- the first indented paragraph 
talks about whether to use -- how much factor 
concentrate is being used, and then there are vario us 
other suggestions: 
"- are you sure you are treating bleeds?  ... 
If you are not absolutely sure think about disobeyi ng 
the rule 'if in doubt treat' for a while."
Then there's a discussion about prophylaxis and                                     
 
                      13 about whether you're overdoing things and then the 
last is about perhaps deferring surgery.
Sir, these are all suggestions being made in 
this book.  Again, you may wish to consider the ext ent 
to which those are options that were, as a matter o f 
fact, or should have been implemented in centres 
earlier. 
Then there is a later discussion about 
heat-treated products but I don't propose to take y ou 
to those. 
That's some extracts from Dr Jones' book AIDS 
and The Blood .
In terms of the arrangements that were made for 
the treatment of patients diagnosed with HIV, we've
set out in our written note some of the staffing 
provision that there was at the Newcastle centre, 
including the availability of social workers.  Ther e 
is evidence to suggest that in or around 1987,
Dr Jones and a consultant in infectious diseases,
Dr Mike Snow, at Newcastle, established some form o f 
liaison or joint care and that's set out in Dr Jone s' 
statement and also referred to in Dr Hamilton's 
statement.  It is clear, however, that Dr Jones 
continued to be involved with the care of patients not 
just for their haemophilia but in respect of HIV an d  
114 AIDS, although he records in his statement some 
individuals requesting their follow-up to be simply
with Dr Snow. 
Sister Fearns in her statement recalls 
Dr Jones, for example, leading an AZT trial. 
In terms of the treatment of those who were 
later diagnosed as suffering from hepatitis C, 
Dr Hamilton's statement records the running of 
a weekly clinic for haemophiliacs with HIV and with
hepatitis C, and he refers in 2000, so upon Dr Jone s' 
retirement, not long before his own, to a joint cli nic 
being established with a newly appointed infectious
diseases consultant.
Sir, I touched last week on the issue of 
testing for hepatitis C.  There is little documenta ry 
evidence, contemporaneous documentary evidence, oth er 
than that which emerges from individual patients' 
medical records and is referred to in their witness
statements.  The closest we have to any kind of 
narrative account of the process for testing for 
hepatitis C is Dr Jones' evidence to the 
Lindsay Tribunal which we looked at last week and s o 
I won't go back to, but you will recall him 
acknowledging before the Lindsay Tribunal that ther e 
was a difference in terms of urgency, in terms of  
115 telling patients the result of their hepatitis C 
testing, as opposed to what he said was the system for 
HIV testing, and that patients would be eventually 
told their diagnosis at the next follow up they 
attended, which could be some time into the distanc e. 
Of course, there is, I should say again, evidence f rom 
individual patients to show that hepatitis C testin g 
at the Newcastle centre might have taken place over
quite a prolonged period of time. 
There is some evidence of early testing for 
some patients in 1989.  Others have not been tested
until 1994.  There's evidence of infrequently treat ed 
mild haemophiliacs, as with other centres, not bein g 
tested early or not being informed of their diagnos is 
properly because of a lack of follow up.  So, again , 
similar things from the themes we have seen in 
relation to a number of other centres. 
I turn next to the question of death 
certification.  We've set out in our note evidence of 
a decision having been made by the coroner local to
the Newcastle area that there would not be a need t o 
hold an open inquest on all AIDS-related deaths, an d 
it appears the motivation there was to preserve the
anonymity of the families. 
In terms of the practice of Dr Hamilton and  
116 Dr Jones, they talk in UKHCDO meetings in the early
1990s of there being a good relationship with the 
coroner in the Newcastle area.  Dr Hamilton is quot ed 
as saying "I didn't put HIV on the death certificat e 
but made sure that the coroner knew about it".  If we 
just go to what Dr Jones said on the topic in a UKH CDO 
meeting it's HCDO0000493.  We can see it's a meetin g 
of 1 October 1993 and, if we go to page 6, please, the 
top paragraph, this is in the context of a discussi on 
about HIV statistics, halfway down that paragraph, so 
about six or seven lines down, it says: 
"Dr Jones said that he did not put AIDS, etc on 
the death certificate.  There was some discussion 
about this and about the way that Directors filled in 
death certificates.  Dr Jones was concerned that th e 
information used when analysing the deaths of peopl e 
with haemophilia should be the information provided  by 
[doctors] and not just the information, as given, o n 
the death certificate." 
Then: 
"He was reassured that it was the Director's 
information that was used when compiling the Annual
Returns and other reports."  
But we can see there, in any event as a matter 
of fact, Dr Jones, like Dr Hamilton saying that AID S                                     
 
                      17 would not be put on the death certificate. 
In terms of medical records, Dr Jones' 
statement suggests there were medical records kept in 
the centre itself in the Victoria Royal Infirmary,
separate to the hospital records system.  He also 
describes there being treatment record cards -- 
I can't recall whether it's Dr Jones or a document 
that refers to these as green cards -- in addition to 
the medical records, and these record cards or gree n 
cards set out the patient's personal information an d 
noted information about each treatment, and they to o 
were kept separately to the medical records. 
Sister Fearns in her statement recalls those 
being removed from the centre in the late 1990s for
scanning and her understanding that they were 
thereafter stored electronically. 
Still on the question of data and records in 
the context of the information provided to Oxford a s 
part of the Oxford returns, Dr Jones in his witness
statement has said that all his patients knew that 
anonymised data was shared principally in relation to 
the Oxford returns but that specific consent was no t 
thought to be necessary.  Again, that specific cons ent 
was not thought to be necessary seems to be the vie w 
of a number of other directors at the time.  
118 Of course, the Inquiry's seen evidence to show 
that it's not just anonymised data that was shared 
with the Oxford Haemophilia Centre but data setting
out patient names and patient details. 
There is a reference in one of the 
contemporaneous documents to Dr Jones not returning  to 
Oxford details of patients with HIV infection. 
Dr Jones, however, in his statement said that's 
actually incorrect and that he did supply data to 
Oxford, including about patients with HIV infection
but not information in relation to sexual partners.
It's also right to note that in UKHCDO meetings 
in the 1980s, in July 1986, Dr Jones had raised 
concerns about data handling in Oxford.  He raised,  at 
a meeting on 2 July, a view that patients should be
asked to give informed consent to data being entere d 
into the Oxford system and he felt that patients ha d 
a right to know that their names and personal detai ls 
were being so held.  The outcome of that particular
meeting was to obtain legal advice. 
Then if we go to HSOC0015334.  This is a set of 
documents that I will no doubt be asking Mr Watters
about in the course of this week, but if we go to t he 
third page we'll see what triggered Mr Watters' mem o,
and it's a letter from Dr Jones and it's just that  
119 I want to look at for present purposes.  In it, and
the date is 14 October 1986, Dr Jones sets out to T he 
Haemophilia Society his view that it's wrong that 
highly personal details about HIV status and AIDS 
should be divulged without individual informed 
consent, and he expresses concern about whether tha t 
is The Haemophilia Society's position or not.  As 
I say, I'll take up the Society's position with 
Mr Watters in the course of the week but you will s ee 
there what Dr Jones was identifying as his particul ar 
concern. 
Sir, there's then the issue of vCJD.  I'm not 
going to go into this in much detail because, for t he 
most part, the notification process was, as it were , 
a centrally organised one with which most Haemophil ia 
Centre Directors complied but it may be instructive  to 
see what Dr Hamilton, who was the consultant largel y 
concerned with this, has to say in his statement. 
Soumik, it's WITN4197005. 
If we go to page 36, please, we can see under 
the heading "vCJD", Dr Hamilton setting out how the
matter was approached in the Newcastle centre.  He 
says he would have been made aware of vCJD potentia l 
contamination in 1997 when Sister Fearns discussed the 
problem with him, and then he recalls the advice fr om  
120 the Lothian Ethical Committee, that patients should
not be informed that the product had been recalled for 
vCJD reasons and says this: 
"Both Sister Fearns and myself were very 
unhappy about this advice because it was our policy  to 
be honest and open with our patients.  I wrote to 
several people expressing my concerns.  I am afraid
I do not now remember why the Lothian Health Board 
were involved at that time." 
Then he goes on in the next paragraph to say: 
"In the centre, against our better judgment, we 
followed the advice issued which was to be economic al 
with the truth in telling the patients why the prod uct 
was being recalled."
From which I infer it was to follow the advice 
of the Lothian Ethical Committee and not tell patie nts 
the reason for the recall. 
He then, in response to the question of how and 
when were patients told of possible exposure to vCJ D,
he refers to the issue arising in around January 20 01 
and a letter that he wrote to all patients explaini ng 
the situation. 
If we can look at that, it's NTHT0000006_002 
and we can see it's dated 22 January 2001.  It's,
I think, a round robin to patients:                                     
 
                      21 "You may have received a letter from The 
Haemophilia Society ..." 
It refers to the information that the 
Haemophilia Centre Directors have received.  
Fourth paragraph:
"... no reports of any cases of vCJD in 
haemophiliacs or in other patients receiving blood 
transfusions or blood products." 
And then over the page we can see the approach 
that was taken.  So he says: 
"As we have been provided with the batch 
numbers of these products, individual patients who 
have received treatment with these have been 
identified. 
"This letter is being sent to all patients,
irrespective of whether they have received the 
currently implicated batches, so that you are aware  of 
this occurrence and as there is the possibility of 
further notifications in the future. 
"Some may wish to know whether they/their child 
have received one of these batches, while others ma y 
choose not to know this information at this time as
the risk is theoretical and there is no test availa ble 
at the moment to confirm if vCJD can be transmitted  in 
these circumstances.  You are asked to think which  
122 approach you would prefer to adopt. 
"For patients who have received any of these 
batches, the information will be recorded in their 
hospital notes in case it may be important for thei r 
care in the future." 
Then he talks about the risk from beef.  Then 
the last paragraph, an offer to ring Sister Fearns or 
have an appointment with Dr Hamilton.  So we can se e 
from that the choice being given to the patient as to 
whether to be informed if they received one of the 
identified batches. 
Sir, the next topic is in relation to research.
We've set out in the note information available to the 
Inquiry about research in which Dr Jones was involv ed. 
Dr Jones' statement essentially contains the 
response that he has no recollection now about thes e 
matters.  I'll just identify briefly four of the ar eas 
of research that have been identified which he does n't 
recall.
There's reference in the documents, first of 
all, in 1976 to involvement in a study of the 
incidence of hepatitis in haemophilia patients in 
collaboration with Treloars.  Dr Jones doesn't reca ll 
involvement in that now. 
There's then reference in 1980 to the  
123 establishment of a trial of prophylaxis therapy in 
both Treloars and Newcastle.  Dr Jones is unable to
recall involvement in that now. 
Thirdly, there's a study with Treloars on the 
claim that high potency Factor VIII had a longer 
in vivo  half-life than other materials.  Again,
Dr Jones has been unable to recall any involvement in 
that. 
Then in 1984 there's an investigation of the 
incidence of hepatitis in haemophiliacs, particular ly 
those with mild or moderate haemophilia, following an 
infusion of Koate, and the documents suggest that 
Dr Jones was to be the or a trial co-ordinator in 
relation to that. 
In particular in relation to the involvement of 
Treloars or the undertaking of research in 
co-ordination with Treloars, we will be looking at 
that later, in later hearings, when we look in more
detail at the position of Treloars and set out what
research we understand to have been undertaken ther e, 
so we may well come back to that issue and to 
Dr Jones' involvement in that regard at a later sta ge. 
We touched this morning with Mr Watters on the 
Medical Advisory Panel, and Dr Jones was heavily 
involved with The Haemophilia Society over a number  of  
124 years, including through sitting on the Medical 
Advisory Panel.  There is a reference in The 
Haemophilia Society materials to Dr Jones having ma de 
a special plea for inclusion when the Medical Advis ory 
Panel was being restructured in the early 1990s, an d 
a report from Mr Watters at the time suggests that the 
Society was retaining him as he was seen as a youth ful 
and skilled communicator and an experienced 
paediatrician.
There's one document which appears to record 
a discussion between Dr Jones and Mr Watters about 
compensation which it may be worth looking at, and 
which we may want to ask Mr Watters about in the 
course of the week. 
Soumik, it's PJON0000134_001.  We'll see it 
reads:
"Meeting with David Watters 13.6.89."
It's not obvious from the document that it's 
a meeting with Dr Jones but it is a document that's
been provided to us by Dr Jones, amongst Dr Jones' own 
papers, and so -- and we know also that Dr Jones wa s 
involved with The Haemophilia Society's campaign fo r 
compensation in the latter part of the 80s. 
So the assumption that we've made is that this 
is a note of a conversation between or a meeting                                     
 
                      25 between Mr Watters and Dr Jones. 
I'm going to read it out because it's an 
interesting document in its own right but no doubt 
Mr Watters maybe able to assist us in due course th is 
week as to whether this records a meeting that he h ad 
with Dr Jones or someone else. 
So it says this: 
"Everything points to some central government 
secret, possibly in the late 1970s/early 1980s,
involving members of the Cabinet.  The solicitors 
acting on behalf of the haemophiliacs are going for
disclosure of government records assumed to be with in 
the Committee on Safety of Medicines, in the hope t hat 
they will embarrass government to give an out of co urt 
settlement.  This may be along the lines of the 
Vaccination Damage Bill which would only result in 
between £20,000-40,000/head.  Remarks made by David
suggest that present members of the Cabinet are 
vulnerable and because of this I suspect that the 
information will not lie within the Committee on 
Safety of Medicines.  A civil servant working for 
Norman Fowler has let it be known to David that it is 
considered within the department that government is
vulnerable and that an out of court settlement shou ld 
be made.  A similar message was given to us at the  
126 meeting at the Ministry by Tony Newton, who was at 
pains to avoid any connection between contamination  of 
blood supplies and decisions taken by him in the pa st. 
We know that the decision for the £10 million pay o ut 
was taken directly by Mrs Thatcher on the afternoon
that a question was raised in the House at the 
beginning of the campaign.  We suspect that the 
Scottish Blood Transfusion Service was primed with 
foreign plasma in order to become self-sufficient, and 
there has been a recent reference to this which I m ust 
find.  If this is true then the scenario could be t hat 
secretly government bought foreign plasma from plas ma 
brokers or possibly directly from industry, and tha t 
there may be a link here to the development of AIDS
and third world countries.  The reasoning could be 
that it was cheaper to buy the raw product that the
finished product using the facility which was not 
running to capacity.  It would have had to be Scotl and 
because Elstree did not have the capability for 
processing large amounts of plasma at this time."

--Result #236--
   The last matter I want to deal with is to 
draw out some of Dr Jones' own words in a radio 
programme he participated in called The Reunion. 
Soumik, it's MDIA0000088. 
Sir, you will see this is "Unedited transcript 
of The Reunion: Contaminated Blood ", and there's 
a note from the producer to say:                                     
 
                      53 "The Reunion is a Radio 4 discussion programme 
that brings together a group of people who were all
closely involved in an event from recent history to
share their memories."  
We can see the participants from the bottom of 
the page and we can see they include Mr Watters, bu t 
they included Dr Peter Jones, they included 
Colette Wintle, from whom the Inquiry has obviously
heard, Janette Johnson, whose son Graham contracted
AIDS and died aged 15, and a patient referred to as
"John", who had been infected with AIDS and HCV as 
a teenager. 
If we go, first of all, Soumik, to page 13, we 
can see in the question from SM -- that's Sue 
MacGregor, the presenter -- to Dr Jones, she says 
this: 
"Peter Jones, how early were you aware that 
there were dangers in the -- some of the blood fact ors 
that came through?"  
This is Dr Jones' response: 
"Right from the very beginning.  From the 
Second World War when blood was of course used as 
whole blood or albumin, it was well known that ther e 
were hepatitis viruses within blood, and we saw 
patients with abnormal liver function tests from  
154 a very early age." 
Then he talks about an answer that John had 
given and says this: 
"But if I could add one thing, the jump which 
John has described was from cryoprecipitate to 
concentrate, and the great thing that that did was to 
allow home therapy.  So families could treat their 
children at home instead of having to go into 
hospital." 
If we go over the page, please, and we look at 
the bottom half of the page, we have CW, that's 
Colette Wintle, referring to patients not being tol d 
of issues relating to hepatitis: 
"... they weren't advised that there was any 
risk at any point, and nor were the parents of 
children."  
The presenter says this: 
"It would seem that not only hospital staff 
were ignorant, because the doctors didn't tell them ,
Peter Jones."  
Top of the next page, this is Dr Jones' 
response: 
"Not in our experience, as I'm sure you'd 
expect me to say.  The hepatitis risk was considere d 
to be so small, and the haemophilia risk so great,  
155 that the enthusiasm for treatment, as David has sai d,
overcame that.  The other thing that one has to 
realise is that haemophilia and especially haemophi lia 
carriership which is symptomatic like Colette, is 
terribly rare.  We're dealing in terms of AIDS late r 
with 1,200 patients out of a UK population of what,
56 million?  So knowledge amongst medical staff, 
general medical staff who aren't specialised in the
subject -- the lack of knowledge among them is very
great ..." 
Ms Wintle refers to the fact that she was 
talking about the knowledge of haematologists not 
general doctors and if we go further down the page 
Dr Jones says this: 
"... they should have known [as in 
haematologists].  And you should have been warned.  In 
the concentrates in particular, there was a leaflet  in 
every -- with every bottle, and all those leaflets 
from a very early stage stated there was a risk of 
hepatitis." 
Ms Wintle made the point she didn't get to see 
the bottles or labels. 
If we then go on to page 18, and we look in the 
top half of the page at Sue MacGregor's observation ,
she says this:  
156 "We should at this stage, perhaps, Peter Jones, 
make it clear that the way blood was donated in the
United States and in the UK was completely differen t. 
In the US you were paid to give blood, and in this 
country it's all done by volunteers.  This proved 
eventually to become very significant."  
Answer from Dr Jones: 
"It was very significant indeed.  We know 
perfectly well, historically, that donors who are 
altruistic as in the United Kingdom will very rarel y 
carry the sort of viruses that somebody who is bein g 
paid in the United States and as you heard from the
'World in Action' clip earlier, these are, some of 
them, drug addicts, alcoholics, skid row donors mak ing 
the only money they can out of giving their blood.
That's where the viruses come in, and then as John has 
said, the blood has to be pooled, the plasma has to  be 
pooled in order to produce enough Factor VIII.  So 
yes, there is a great difference between the two." 
Pausing there, you may no doubt wish to 
contrast that with Dr Jones' own comments in the 
Northumbrian branch of The Haemophilia Society's 
spring 1976 newsletter, when he commented to rather
different effect on the World in Action programme. 
If we go over the page to page -- two pages                                     
 
                      57 please to page 20, and if we look at the bottom hal f 
of the page, we can see -- so what's then recorded or 
played in The Reunion is a recording from an earlie r 
Panorama programme from the 1980s.  So where it say s 
"PJ on recording" that's Dr Jones as recorded in th e 
Panorama programme from the 1980s and it records 
Dr Jones then saying:
"We had to, we had no choice, this is a -- 
I mean in retrospect again, this a catch-22 
situation --"  
Then it looks like Sue MacGregor says: 
"This is you defending Factor VIII.
Dr Jones on the Panorama recording: 
"-- we either imported or we didn't treat 
haemophiliacs, and if you look at haemophiliacs in 
developing countries that have no Factor VIII, it i s 
appalling.  I mean two thirds of them are dead befo re 
they reach their third decade and the rest of them are 
lucky to survive without really severe and painful 
arthritis." 
Of course, there's no consideration there of 
the role of cryoprecipitate. 
Then, if we go to the next page, we see, top 
half of the page, this is still the recording so th is 
is something being said by Dr Geoffrey Savidge, and 
158 then "PJ on recording", so this is Dr Jones: 
"Well, if you take it at its lowest level, a 
hundred are going to get AIDS.  If you take it at t he 
highest level, which is the level for male homosexu als 
in the United States, then perhaps two hundred of t hem 
will get AIDS." 
Then Sue MacGregor says: 
"Well, Peter Jones, that was the younger you 
speaking.  And we now know it was six times that 
number."  
He's asked to comment on that.  Dr Jones says 
this: 
"No, it was slow progress.  The first case, the 
first testing from the discovery of the virus in 19 81,
was in 1982, and we now know that most of the 
haemophilia population who were infected were infec ted 
in the mid- to late 70s [Dr Jones accepts in his 
witness statement that that's not correct].  So in 
fact the disease was ahead of the testing, and as t he 
disease emerged in the hospitals and clinics, we sa w 
the true extent of the disease." 
If we go on then to page 24, and I should say 
the context for this is the other participants,
including Ms Wintle having talked about the importa nce 
of the patients knowing if there was a risk, and th en  
159 Dr Jones says this: 
"It's easy to talk in retrospect.  With respect 
to Colette, we did advise all our patients and we d id 
have informed consent, and I have the book where th e 
nurses rigorously recorded the names of the patient s 
and the date that they gave their consent for the 
testing.  And we followed up those patients, the 
children every three months and the adults every si x 
months, and they were always tested for liver 
function.  So everybody, patients and staff, knew t he 
status of the liver function which reflected the 
hepatitis virus." 
I should say we have asked about this book and 
it appears it's no longer in existence or available . 
Then if we go on to page 44 please, Soumik.  
Pick it up halfway down the page, there is 
a discussion about publicity regarding the spread o f 
AIDS in the 1980s.  Sue MacGregor says: 
"It doesn't sound as if there was a very good 
publicity about this at the time." 
Dr Jones: 
"It was lousy.  From the point of view of the 
Department of Health, we likened them to hermit cra bs. 
They'd come out and show themselves when they had 
something to say and then they'd disappear back int o  
160 their shells." 
Then he refers to the AIDS conference organised 
in Newcastle in 1986 by Dr Jones, and talks about t he 
scale of media intrusion, and he says this: 
"I used to take between forty and fifty phone 
calls a night at the height of this, from newspaper s, 
particularly in the United Kingdom --"
If we go on then to page 53, we can see,
picking it up about a third of the way down the 
page -- well, first of all, Dr Jones says there's n o 
alternative, and then Colette Wintle saying there w as,
and Dr Jones saying: 
"There was no alternative but plasma and 
cryoprecipitate until a drug called DDAVP ... came 
in."  
Then he talks about DDAVP in these terms: 
"... the first worry about this drug, which is 
also called Desmopressin, is that you could only gi ve 
it once.  So, you were in a dilemma again.  We now 
know that's not true, but you were in a dilemma aga in 
about what that once was to be: was it to be a brai n 
haemorrhage, was it to be surgery, was it to be den tal 
extractions?  So you were in difficulty again.  But
the mild patients, certainly, if we'd known about 
DDAVP earlier, should have been treated with DDAVP. "                                     
 
                      61 Not entirely clear what he's talking about 
there or what time period he's referring to because
we've obviously heard evidence from others that DDA VP 
was in regular use from around 1978 onwards. 
If we go over the page -- sorry, actually 
I should pick it up -- sorry, Soumik, sticking with
this page -- bottom of the page we have Ms Wintle 
saying: 
"... I'm saying they shouldn't have been 
exposed to commercial US plasma ... on the scale th at 
they were.  Particularly --" 
Dr Jones says: 
"All I can say --" 
If we go over the page Ms Wintle says: 
"-- with the risks that were known."  
Dr Jones says this: 
"-- All I can say is that I entirely agree with 
you.  We exposed one of our patients to a concentra te 
from America when he was, I think, seven.  And the 
reason for that exposure was that the family, in 
particular, wanted him on home therapy.  And so did
we.  And that later transpired to have given that 
patient HIV, and he died when, I think, he was 
11 years old.  So in retrospect, that was a wrong 
decision and we shouldn't have put him on home  
162 therapy." 
Then if we go on to page 66, this is the last 
set of extracts, this and the following pages.  I'm
sorry I should pick it up at the bottom of page 62,
please, Soumik.  So the bottom of the previous page . 
We can see that there is a long or relatively 
long statement by Ms Wintle and then Sue MacGregor at 
the bottom of the page says: 
"Peter Jones, do you accept that criticism of 
doctors?"  
Dr Jones says: 
"-- No I don't.  No, no ..."
Sue MacGregor says: 
"-- Of actually people being given -- it was 
not inadvertent, people knew that the blood plasma was 
infected." 
Top of the next page, Dr Jones says this: 
"That is totally wrong.  I've been through 
two years while I was working, I retired 16 years a go,
of litigation for -- against the Health Authority w ith 
the lawyers.  And then I worked for a while with th e 
Irish Haemophilia Society and their litigation agai nst 
the Irish Government.  And then more recently we've
been through three more years with the General Medi cal 
Council of being accused of all sorts of malpractic e  
163 in the care of our patients.  None of these things 
have been found in the way that Colette had suggest ed. 
None of them have turned up, like the Inquiry in 
Scotland, anything to suggest negligence and I can' t 
stress that more."
Then he says this: 
"We're faced now with a small group of patients 
and families who are still extremely angry for obvi ous 
reasons, but within those groups are people who are  so 
self-centred, and so manipulative that they can 
continue to pretend there is going to be a favourab le 
response to compensation.  And on their side,
unfortunately, they have a gullible press who love 
human stories.  So this makes, this makes life --"
Then there's a question from Sue MacGregor 
about compensation, and Dr Jones says: 
"I don't think that they will ever receive -- 
what is the right sort of compensation?"
Sue MacGregor:  "You mean it's impossible to 
judge."  
Dr Jones: "Well I think that within the society 
of the United Kingdom it is.  David and I called it
recompense in order to try to get what led to the 
Macfarlane Trust ... 
"Which was some form of recompense and we used  
164 it to treat problems rather than patients." 
He's then asked how much doctors were affected 
by the arguments and distressing things that happen ed 
to their patients and, over the page, he says at th e 
top: 
"Very badly, there are rumours of suicides,
there's certainly depression ...my nursing staff --
very badly affected.  And the reason we've come 
through it is because we work as teams and support 
each other, and we've got strong families." 
Then Ms Wintle makes an observation that that 
pales into insignificance compared to what happened  to 
the haemophilia community. 
Ms Wintle then raises the Archer Inquiry and,
if we go to the next page, this is what Dr Jones ha s 
to say: 
"I'm sorry to have to say, but in my opinion 
the Archer Report was useless.  The evidence that w as 
given was non-adversarial, it was not taken under 
oath, it wasn't a legal process and I know from 
experience that some people who gave evidence at th at 
inquiry lied." 
He's asked why they did, and he said this: 
"Because they're so angry.  And in the case of 
one person that I know, this is entirely self-centr ed                                     
 
                      65 and acquisitive -- they want money.  You can have a ll 
the reasons that Colette gives for why they want 
money, but they're now doing harm not only to 
themselves, in my opinion, but also to the new 
generation of people with haemophilia who are growi ng 
up with their families and they're faced at all 
meetings of The Haemophilia Society with this anger . 
And it should be dissipated by now." 
Then he's asked by Sue MacGregor if they're not 
to get money what would they suggest, and she asks 
about an apology.  He says: 
"Well of course they should have an apology. 
We've apologised and apologised and apologised, and
David Cameron apologised twice."
Ms Wintle's intervention: 
"Yes, but he did say for something that should 
not have happened."
Dr Jones: "Well of course it shouldn't have 
happened but it did!"
Dr Jones was asked about his comments in 
The Reunion programme when he made his witness 
statement.  If we could go, please, to WITN0841005 and 
if we go to page 49, please, he says this (so this is 
in his statement to the Inquiry):
"... I do not accept the criticism of doctors  
166 especially with regard to the counselling of patien ts 
and their families and to informed consent.  I do 
believe that the anger, which is a normal part of t he 
grieving process, should have reduced over time and
that the continued campaigning using false informat ion 
can only do harm to the new generation of patients and 
their families.  My record shows that I was an acti ve 
campaigner for compensation myself ... and I theref ore 
suggest that I do know what I am talking about."  
As to the question relating to lies (that's the 
allegation he made in The Reunion that people told 
lies to the Archer Inquiry), he says this: 
"... the medical record involved contains 
evidence of these but is of course confidential. 
"With regard to the Archer Inquiry, I stand by 
my comment for the reasons stated in the transcript . 
My colleagues and I were informed at an early stage
that it was a 'fishing exploration', which is why w e 
did not participate.  In addition, there was no 
information on funding." 

--Result #237--

I'm going to take you to one more piece of this advice
as well.  Electronic page 9, paragraph 7.3.
Paragraph 7.2 concerns the legal arguments about
whether or not there is a duty of care owed by the CSM
and there 
has 
been similar discussion
 
about duty of care
owed by the Department.  In 7.3 Mr Collins wrote this:
"If this is right [his legal analysis
], 
there is
no
 alternative Defendant in the Haemophiliac cases and
they will not be compensated through the courts.  I note
that a decision had been taken not to compensate them in
other ways, 
for
 
example
 a scheme such as applied by the
Vaccine Damage Act.  There is, I think, much to be said
for some such scheme to compensate those who fall
victim, through 
no
 fault of their own, to a
 
medical
disaster.  But that is a political and not a legal
problem
, 
although a sympathetic judge may be persuaded
to take 
asked
 of the absence of alternative compensation
in deciding whether there is a duty of care, that being
 
35
one of the surrounding circumstances."
First of all, 
did
 you agree
 
with that paragraph
and the sentiments expressed in it?

--Result #238--

I can't remember whether I put 
it 
in my statement.
I never would have quite used the 
trenchant 
language of
Andrew, who was pretty senior, and I was pretty junior
and 
still fresh from the Army
, 
where we did what we were
told
, 
as opposed to saying what people should do
.
I entirely agreed with the concept
 
and
, 
throughout
my involvement in this, this is one of my strong
recollections, it is really important that part of the
Government's function is to look with care and love at
all those in its constituency, and where there is
a legal claim, there is a legal claim, and you deal
with it under the law
.  
Where there is not, you then
have to consider 
the 
human and the resource and the
policy case.  You cannot compensate everybody who is the
victim of misfortune.  That
 
is impossible in a society
with limited resources.
Therefore, if you have a really serious
misfortune
 -- 
and there are many medical 
mis
fortunes, as
mistakes have been made and knowledge 
is 
learned, things
you could have done 20 years ago, if somebody 
had
realised it, and then it was discovered
.  
But Government
should be there to make political decisions where there
 
36
is an
 
absolutely massive case for some form of
compensation of an
 
extra legal sort
.  
And I mean that
certainly informed my view throughout, and we see it
happening.  You know, whether it is aid to Ukraine or
whether it is aid to victims of disasters at Aberfan
 
or
anywhere else, that is a function of Government to fill
in the gap between what the law will do
 
and what it is
proper to do.  But the question of what it is proper to
do is a political decision, not a legal decision.
And that's why I was always careful not to push my
views down the throat of those instructing me
, 
in the
way that Andrew probably felt able to do so, but to make
clear whenever asked my view
 
and, you know, you'll come
on 
to
 
it
, but my absolute overriding view was that
, 
in
this case
, 
the plaintiffs would all fail.  They would
all go through the agony of a trial and they would lose,
and get 
no
 compensation.
But such is the terrible nature of the
consequences on this already much afflicted group of
people, that at the end of it, the public outcry for
compensation would have been all the louder and the
Government would have ended up paying lots of money to
lawyers, which is not a thing I'm very keen on, and then
having to spend more money on compensation because of
the outcry.  And my 
view
 is that I'd rather have all the
 

9 June 2022
          
          

  37
money go to compensation and dispense with the lawyers
.

--Result #239--

I'm going to move on, then, to a conference that you had
with the Department of Health and those representing the
Department of Health and the Committee on Safety of
 
40
Medicines and the Licensing Authority on
19 October 1989
, 
so at the same time as this discussion
was taking place.
We have
, 
first of all -- I won't ask for it to be
brought up, but there is a reference which is not in
your statement
, 
so I give it for the transcript
:
DHSC0019630
.  
Which is
,
 in effect
,
 an agenda for the
conference which was sent by letter, by Mr Powell, 
sent
to Mr Desai but also to you, and he said that he wanted
to consider three issues: levels of compensation if the
case is lost
; 
advice on the likelihood of the success on
the preliminary issues before going on to consider
settlement
; 
and
, 
thirdly, the Sunday Times campaign for
compensation that was running at the same time
.  
It's
that issue that I'd like to pick up on in particular
.

--Result #240--

Moving on to a separate part of the note then, if we
stay on the same page, please, electronic page 2 of that
document, 
four
 paragraphs down, there is a discussion of
the
 -- 
slightly 
gnomic 
comments on the merits of the
case and the issue about preliminary issues being tried.
But then right at the bottom, just the final two
sentences:
"Counsel feels that the plaintiffs will lose the
case.  Ministers, he felt, should consider
compensation."
This not your note, but doing the best you can
,
looking back on it, that second sentence "Ministers, he
felt, 
should 
consider compensation
", 
what do you think
you were saying 
--

--Result #241--

I think I was almost certainly saying what I've said
already I think 
today
, which is that from what I knew
about or believed to be the case about legal duties,
which we've covered
, 
the extent of duty of care, what
 

9 June 2022
          
          

  45
I had
 seen of the documentation and the difficulty of
proving an actual breach of duty
, 
if there was a duty at
all, and the problems of causation, I was
 -- "
confident
"
is 
a wrong
 word, but I was strongly of the view that the
claims would fail as a matter of law, and the judge
would have to dismiss the claims on the law, but
because -- I mean
, 
the simple fact of haemophiliacs
suffering from HIV is poignant and tragic enough in
itself
; 
if you have a trial where victims and their
family are 
re
counting the consequences
, 
you will get an
outcry for compensation.  And the reason you get an
outcry for compensation is not 
a 
sort of bad thing we
want to try to avoid, it's because there is a really
strong case for compensation
, 
and therefore
 -- 
it's not
my job as a lawyer to say
, "
As a matter of pol
icy 
you
should compensate
"
.  It is my job as a lawyer to say
,
"
There is a huge compassionate case here, and my best
judgment is that the consequences of a trial would be an
even greater outcry and one which ministers would find
it very hard to resist
".  
Particularly because it
spanned
 two administrations and 
so it 
was not 
going
 
to
be 
a party
 and 
party issue
, 
it was a cross-party issue
.
And it's
 exactly
 -- I mean, 
you don't simply get
closure because the case is lost and everybody goes
home
, 
because the haemophiliacs and their family are
 
46
still there.  So that is the kind of thinking which
I had throughout, and which informed my view of
subsequent litigation.
And I was probably saying that in probably less
sophisticated terms because I was 30 years younger.

--Result #242--

-- 
in essence, to say that al
though 
he recognised the
legal difficulties that the plaintiffs faced
, 
he urged
both 
sides 
to compromise the claim and said he wouldn't
want the legal system to be perceived as
, 
in his 
words,
and 
I quote
: 
"... 
a scapegoat for an
 
unjust and inhumane denial
of any significant measure of compensation to the
plaintiffs."
Just
 on that intervention, was it a rare and
unusual intervention
, 
in your experience
, 
at that time?

--Result #243--

I don't know what it was.  I can tell you what I think
it might have been
, 
from my general approach 
to
 
it
, and
the discussions
 -- well, 
what I believe to have been the
 
107
discussions I would have had with Andrew Collins and
Michael Spencer
, 
thus informing my general view
.  
Which
is that you either had to have some form of 
no
 fault
compensation scheme, pure and simple, or it might be
possible to say
: 
if you will accept for the purposes of
this litigation that there is 
no
 duty in relation to
policy matters and/or to CSM and Licensing Authority,
then we might be prepared to do some sort of compromise
on an assumption
 -- 
no
 need to prove a breach of the
operational duty.  It would have been some way in which
we could preserve what was really important, and yet at
the same time find a way through the litigation.
I mean
, 
the 
no
-
fault compensation scheme or the
 --
whatever you call the settlement, and it could be
classified in a number of ways, was fairly
unprecedented, as an approach.  There had been
no
 
payments to vaccine damages without litigation.  So
I think that's the sort of thing we would have been
discussing
.
What 
went
 into the advice, whether it was
finalised
, 
I don't know.

--Result #244--

When you say that one of the options would have been
a no-fault compensation system, do you mean a general
no
-
fault compensation system or just a no-fault
compensation system in respect of people with
 
108
haemophilia, infected --

--Result #245--

People with -- we were focusing on haemophiliacs in
their unique position.  It was not intended to be
a precedent of no-fault compensation scheme.  It was
a way of providing compensation to them, and I suspect
we would have already had in mind the fact that if there
was 
going to be a scheme irrespective of 
liability
, it
would need to 
extend
 to haemophiliacs
, 
because otherwise
if you give a no-fault compensation scheme to those who
brought a claim, why should those who haven't brought
a claim be excluded?
And I think we
, 
to the best I recollect
 it, 
there
was a clear view expressed that if you're going to
compensate
 
you have to compensate everybody, and not
just say
, "
You haven't 
sued, 
so you can't have it.
"

--Result #246--

So there was increasing pressure from outside the
litigation on Government at that stage.  So the move
from "We don't settle cases unless we are advised that
we lose them or have a significant chance of losing
them
", 
and "We don't set any precedents
", 
I think
gradually gave 
way 
to "If we can find a way of providing
compensation to these victims without damaging
 (
a) our
willingness to fight cases on their merits
; 
and (b) not
creating a precedent, then we 
should 
do so
", 
I think
,
came in.
The changes of personalities
 
may have made that
appear more accentuated.  I mean
, 
William Waldegrave
 --
I certainly attended meetings with both of them and
I
 
can't remember whether it was one or two or more
;
William Waldegrave had a very different style to
Kenneth Clarke
.
I think they both had exactly the same concerns.
 
131
So that was a slightly softer way of looking at it.
I do think that the elevation of John Major to Prime
Minister made a differen
ce
, partly because of differ
ence
of personalities, but also I think I per
ceived
 it as
"
this is an
 
opportunity to make a change
", 
because it
came very rapidly after the change in power, and I think
this was John Major indicating -- I mean
, 
as I 
saw
 it,
I had 
no
 idea of what went on, but I very much got the
feeling that John Major said, "
Well,
 we really ought to
do something about that.  How can we do it?"  That's my
perception
.

--Result #247--

Um ... I thought it was -- I mean
, 
I must be
reconstructing here because I've got 
no
 specific memory.
I mean
, 
I remember the time, and I remember being
,
I think
, 
pleased that there was an 
offer
 here which
 
135
appeared to be responsible in recognising the
difficulties.  It would still provide some substantial
compensation when you added it
 -- added
 Macfarlane
payments and Social Security benefits and the cost
provisions
, 
which were very important
.  
And it was
something which I think I thought there was a reasonable
prospect that Government
, 
the Department
, 
Secretary of
State, would accept.  So it wasn't so 
high
that I
 
thought
, "
We'll
 
never get this through
", 
nor was
it so low that I thought
, "
This is going to be the worst
of both worlds
, 
because 
we'll
 be paying something and
it'll be not nearly enough
.
"
So I thought it was a pragmatic carefully thought
out proposal by -- and Dan Brennan was a personal
injuries specialist, Rupert Jackson was a professional
negligence
 
and general specialist
, 
with a lot of
experience, Michael Brooke was a personal injury
specialist for all his ca
reer
.  So it was carefully
thought out
 -- 
and 
there were 
experience
d
 
solicitors
behind them
.  
The fact that I don't mention 
the
solicitors is because I don't remember the 
individuals
,
not because they played 
no
 part in it
.
So this seemed to us to be something that had been
carefully thought out 
that
 they were prepared to
recommend.  They must in doing so, I felt, have
 
136
concluded that this was advice that they 
could 
properly
give to their clients which their clients would
, 
on the
whole
, 
be likely to accept, bearing in mind that there
were not just the lead solicitors but also other firms
of solicitors up and down the country representing
individual 
plaintiffs, so a large group of people.  And
we thought it was something we could take to the
Department and recommend.

--Result #248--

Why was that?  
Well,
 I don't remember it.
  
I'm just
trying to put myself back into the position as to how
that came about.
  
It is, I think, as you've shown me,
the result of an
 
insertion put in by the plaintiffs in
their amendment
, 
rather than something which came from
the Department.  Let me interject, unless I forget it,
you asked me about that first version
, 
whether it came
from us or the plaintiffs.  I can answer that when
you're ready to 
a
sk
 
it but I won't intervene now.
 
167
The point about this is that many of those who
were suing for their HIV infection had also contracted
hepatitis.  Their claims did not include any claim for
hepatitis.  There was 
no
 claim for damages for
hepatitis.  Whether that was because 
they
 recognised
that hepatitis was known about and was an
 
inevitable
risk of the 
process
, whether it was because it just
paled
 into insignificance
, 
or appeared to at that stage
,
by comparison to HIV, I don't know, but no claims were
brought in respect of the hepatitis damage suffered by
any of the 900-odd plaintiffs.
Therefore
, 
there was 
no
 question of those who had
contracted HIV claiming also for damages for contracting
hepatitis.  It was not part of the claim.
The reason that claims
, 
in respect of hepatitis
,
was settled by the litigation is because the subject
matter of the cause of action was the failure to
introduce measures to reduce hepatitis risk in time.  So
exactly the same facts and matters would be in issue in
relation to hepatitis
, 
as were in relation to that first
part of the HIV claim
, 
which we discussed earlier.
By discontinuing the -- if the claim had 
gone 
to
judgment and had won or lost, those plaintiffs would not
normally have been allowed to bring a fresh claim for
hepatitis damage because it arose out of the same facts
 
168
and matters
 -- 
that is damage they knew about --
therefore
, 
it would have been caught by the
discontinuance subject matter clause.
As a result, by giving up 
the 
hepatitis claim,
they were simply saying, "We will not revive that claim
again"
.
If they had brought a claim in respect of
hepatitis, which I can see would be logical, and I can't
now say why they didn't, then it would have been
necessary for the Government to decide, do 
we
 give
compensation to cover the hepatitis damage separately
from the HIV damage, or not?  And what provisions do we
make?
The reason that I took you to the cut-off for that
at
 
page 16 of that document 23174
 
is because that
applied to non-plaintiffs because they contracted HIV.
Now, I suppose if somebody had thought about it,
they could have said
, "
Well,
 what about if somebody
doesn't contract, or contracts HIV but also suffers from
hepatitis?  Should they get compensation for the
hepatitis element
?"  
Well
, firstly, if they were to do
so, it would put the non-plaintiffs in a better position
than the plaintiffs who had decided not to claim for it.
And
, 
secondly, in order to prove their hepatitis claim
prior to December 2000, they would have had to run
 

9 June 2022
          
          

  169
exactly the same arguments which were being run in this
litigation
, 
which the whole purpose of the settlement
was to avoid.  So I think that nobody thought about
claims for hepatitis because they'd never been brought,
and nobody thought of putting the non-plaintiff
haemophiliacs into a better position than the plaintiff
haemophiliacs
, 
who had already contracted HIV, and who
were all expected to die.
Now, if the claim 
had
 included a claim in respect
of hepatitis, I do not know whether that would have
added to the damages significantly, given the
differences between the effects of the two, or whether
the compensation would have been different, but I can
see that if such a claim had been brought, I would have
expected the cut-off in this page 16 for non-plaintiff
haemophiliacs who haven't contracted HIV
, 
to apply to
those who contracted HIV and/or hepatitis, or there
would be a carve-out for hepatitis.
There was 
no
 reason in principle why one couldn't
say
 "
If you have not been tested for hepatitis, and
contracted -- and you're found on first administration
to have it, then you can sue
".  
But nobody was thinking
of hepatitis at that stage.  It wasn't raised.

--Result #249--

That -- I mean
, 
you're asking one question, but positing
two there.  I don't mean that critically, I mean it's
a wider debate.
 
175
I completely agree that if we had known then that
,
with the 
ad
vent of experimental treatment, those who
became HIV positive would have an extended period of
life, perhaps indefinite
 -- 
and as 
we
 know, many have
survived for 30 and more years because of these
treatments
 -- 
then it would have made a difference to
everybody's perception of the appropriate compensation,
both by way of full damages
 
if they were to succeed, and
by way of compensation on this kind of scheme.  For two
reasons
, 
and in two opposite directions
: 
firstly, there
was not the inevitability of early death in a terrible
manner
; 
but secondly, there was the long
-
lasting effect
of having to go through experimental treatment and
continuing treatment in addition to the treatment for
haemophilia.
Now, I have not sought to 
analyse
, and none of us
did at the time, whether the removal of the certainty of
death, 
but
 the addition of many years of suffering with
HIV
 
positive
, 
would increase, decrease, or leave the
same the level of damages.  But it would certainly have
been approached in a different manner.
Equally, and this is a hidden bit of the question,
if
 -- 
at this stage
, 
from recollection, hepatitis C was
still called non-A, non-B
.  
There was 
no
 reliable test,
so it is said, and there may be debate about this,
 
176
I don't know, I haven't studied it, but 
no
 tests which
was generally admitted as reliable for hepatitis C until
I think about 1991
.  
It is entirely possible that the
plaintiffs themselves would have said
: 
hepatitis C is
much more serious than other forms of hepatitis,
therefore there is 
an 
incremental form of damages and
,
because there is a longer lifespan, that could get worse
and could 
become
 more serious, therefore we'll include
a claim for it.
So those two elements were missing, both in each
side's thinking, and in the formulation and settlement
of the claim.
So what has 
actually
 happened is different to what
everybody expected when that settlement was proposed,
agreed and made.

--Result #250--

As we will see from the documents, it may be that your
involvement was really quite limited, 
as
 
you
 
say
,
peripheral to it.
The instructions are, if we go to page 2, to draft
a defence in response to a statement of claim which 
has
been brought by an individual who 
has 
contracted
hepatitis C through the use of blood products.
The
 second and third elements 
of 
the instructions
,
which 
are 
annotated with the words "later
"
 and "in due
course
", 
are to advise in writing about general
liability and about liability in public law
.  
The
compensation scheme or payment scheme was not set up.
Do you know if you did ever provide those general
advices?

--Result #251--

Yes
, certainly
.  
I mean
, 
the -- it's Dr Kernoff from the
Royal Free Hospital, so these will have been writs to
the Royal Free Hospital as
, 
I think
, 
a Special Health
Authority, or similar.  They will therefore be related
,
almost certainly
,
 to the clinical negligence aspect, as
 
195
opposed to the policy resource aspect.  It would have
been a claim
, 
if it had been brought by a haemophiliac
in this litigation, which could have been within the
carve-out for claims against Health Authorities for
negligence in their clinical treatment.  So that is
probably why we weren't involved.  It would not have
been
,
 therefore
,
 banned.
I'm not sure that Dr Rejman is correct in what he
says in paragraph 3.  Now, I stress in what I'm saying,
I'm not either seeking to replicate the advice of those
advising those plaintiffs, nor of the Department, nor am
I acting 
for
 
the
 Department.  I'm giving a view looking
at it now and seeing it
.
There is a difference between the undertakings
given by plaintiffs
, 
which we've looked at, and the
nature of the undertaking which the settlement agreement
required to be given by non-plaintiffs
, 
which are to be
found, if we can just look at it, HSOC002317
4
-22
.  
And
I think I'm
 
right in this, but I've only had about five
minutes to look at it, so ...
This deals with
 
a
:
"... 
qualifying non-plaintiff
 ...
 entitled to
receive benefits from the new Macfarlane Trust
 ..."
And we looked at the carve-out for diagnosis
:
"
... 
corresponding to their circumstances 
up
on
 
196
signing an undertaking not to bring proceedings against
any Defendant or against any other Government body in
respect of the administration of cryoprecipitate
[
et cetera
] 
before 
... 
December 1990, save that nothing
prevents a qualifying non-plaintiff from bringing
proceedings in respect of 
the administering prior to
13th December ... of 
cryoprecipitate Factor VIII or
Factor IX 
where:- 
"(1)
 that has caused damage to such Plaintiff
which 
had
 not been diagnosed by 13th December 1990
; and 
"
(
2
) the damage alleged does not include infection
or the risk of infection by HIV and/or the hepatitis
viruses."
So the non-diagnosis is -- keeps in for those
non-plaintiffs other treatment damage, excluding
hepatitis and HIV.  But the undertaking is in respect 
of
what's called a government body.  Now
, 
I do not know why
we have that wording
, 
compared with the wording you have
at page 20 of this document, paragraph 5.
And there the undertaking is
 "
not to bring fresh
proceedings against any defendant or against any other
Government Department, Health Authority
 
or treating
doctor
"
.
Now
, 
a treating doctor is undoubtedly not
a government body.  It appears to me
 -- 
and nobody has
 

9 June 2022
          
          

  197
instructed me to do it, so I'm doing this as a thinking
lawyer
, 
rather than somebody's adviser
 -- 
that a Health
Authority would normally be treated as a government
body.  So -- and
, 
of course, if somebody was diagnosed
with HIV, who was not a plaintiff, and that person also
had a clinical negligence claim
 -- 
I call it that for
simplicity
 -- 
the claims carved out against the local
Health Authorities, then one would expect them to be put
in 
no
 worse a situation than the plaintiffs
.
So
, 
in other words, plaintiffs in the litigation
who had a claim for treatment against the Health
Authority, whether for hepatitis or for HIV, whether
for, if you like, 
a 
full settlement, full compensation
for HIV because of their 
treatment
, 
for
 
example
 
they did
not need to be given imported Factor VIII
, 
or whatever
it was, or who had a claim they wanted to bring
 
for
hepatitis
, 
wouldn't be prevent
ed
 from doing so because
of the carve-out 
from the 
settlement
.
I would have expected that if a 
non-
plaintiff was
subsequently diagnosed with HIV, and also had a claim
for hepatitis arising from their treatment
, 
as opposed
to arising from the sources, that 
they
 would either have
obtained confirmation or their lawyers would either have
obtained confirmation from the Macfarlane Trust
, 
that
that reference to -- let me get the right word -- spread
 
198
of the virus through Factor VIII
, 
as opposed to
administration of the virus, so that does not prevent me
bringing my claim for clinical negligence
 
for being
given hepatitis when measures could have been taken to
have given me heat
-
treated Factor VIII
, 
or whatever
, 
or
would have said
 "
I'm not going to advise my client to
sign that undertaking, I want first to have a carve-out
so I can pursue my clinical negligence claim"
.
Now
, 
I don't know whether that happened, I haven't
considered it before this document arrived on my table
ten
 
minutes ago, but I note the distinction between the
two.  I expect there was a reason for the difference in
wording.  I think it may have been that but I'm
speculating.  But I'm not sure that it would be correct
to characterise the undertaking which was required by
paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement to preclude
claims in clinical negligence for hepatitis
 --

--Result #252--

They were haemophiliacs who subsequently became infected
with HIV

and the aim was to bring them in and give them
the same rights and the same compensation 
as
 the
plaintiffs.  Now
, 
that being the case, it would have
been surprising and unintended if the effect of that was
a clinical negligence type claims which were permitted
outside the settlement 
in 
the Macfarlane Trust, would
not be also open to such 
non-
plaintiffs
.
Now
, 
I have 
no
 personal knowledge of it, but
certainly if anybody had asked me at the time what the
position would have been, that would have been, I think,
my response.

--Result #253--

I think it would be 
wrong 
to say that it was my
experience in HIV which le
d 
me to include that
.  
I mean
,
the document was produced with close involvement with
Alan Milburn, the then Secretary of State for Health
,
and the Treasury.  It was put together by myself and
Stephen Irwin
, 
acting for the plaintiffs
, 
so it was
a collaborative document.  And I think it arose from
a sense there was a very strong but small group of
plaintiffs who felt very much that they wanted to have
the right to have their day in court, and not simply to
accept the compensation.
I think we all thought the compensation was fair,

and such claims were
 
unlikely to be pursued.  If we had
formed the view that a lot of them were still likely to
bring the claims, there may have been 
no
 settlement, and
my own view is that
, 
if 
it 
had been a condition imposed
by the plaintiffs in HIV, they should be permitted to
claim, having received the compensation
.  
It would have
been significantly more difficult to get Government
approval and support for it.

Yes
, I don't know who is listening.  I don't know who is
here.  I don't know what they are.  My aim, whenever
I've been in court representing Government or
manufacturers, or other people adversely affected in
this kind of way, is to make sure that the process of
defending the claims
, 
which is my job
, 
or was my job
here, is done with proper sympathy for their position
.
Now
, 
we never got to court, so I never had that
 
215
opportunity, as I did with
,
 
for example,
 Human Growth
Hormone and certain other cases.  But there is 
no
 doubt
that this was a massive tragedy, that it was a wholly
disastrous effect on the haemophiliacs, which deserves
to be recognised.  We recognised it in the way that was
available to us at the time.  But it doesn't take away
any of that, and it does mean that I emphasise
 -- 
it's
in my written statement, I don't take time repeating 
it
now -- that my view remains stronger than ever, 
having
learned again about all of this by reading it, that
consideration of
 
at least a selective procedure for
no-fault compensation in major tragedies is really
worthy of reconsideration.

 You see in the first sentence there, first paragrap h: 
"While we are ever mindful -- and deeply 
appreciative -- of the £10 million granted on 
an ex gratia basis in 1987 and with which the 
Macfarlane Trust has been established, that is simp ly 
not enough to give people charge over their own 
affairs as they so rightly deserve in the 
circumstances understanding which they have to live . 
While, then, the Macfarlane Trust has been useful o ver 
the past two years it cannot take the place of 
compensation and, indeed any case, is chronically 
underfunded for the task it has to undertake. 
"We urge you and your colleagues to review the 
situation whereby those cases will have to drag 
themselves all the way through the Courts in a mann er 
that will be both costly and deeply humiliating for
both the litigants and the Government." 
That's the letter that would have been sent to 
you, July 1989.  I just want to look at the reply t hat 
was sent, in fact, by Lord Trafford, rather than 
you -- 

--Result #256--
 If we look at DHSC0003989_067.  This a letter of  
138 21 August 1989 from Lord Trafford "Thank you for yo ur 
letter [to you]", then the second paragraph: 
"The Secretary of State shares the great 
sympathy we all feel, and my Ministerial colleagues
have often expressed, for all those who have suffer ed 
this great misfortune.  We demonstrated this sympat hy 
in a tangible way by providing on an entirely 
ex gratia basis the £10 million grant to the 
Macfarlane Trust which you acknowledge in your lett er. 
We were deeply anxious to do whatever we properly 
could.
"However, it remains our view as we indicated in 
response to your Society's main campaign, that the 
question of compensation is a matter for the Courts  to 
decide." 
Then reference is made to the proceedings.
Two matters, Lord Clarke.  First of all, is it 
right to understand this exchange of correspondence  is 
essentially -- the Government is saying no to the 
particular plea put forward by The Haemophilia Soci ety 
in its letter. 

--Result #257--
 That's if you start paying out full compensation 
without any negligence or liability. 

--Result #258--
 Then you say: 
"If we were, on behalf of this particular group,
to separate compensation from the need to establish
negligence, there is no doubt that the Department 
would be joined in other litigious actions involvin g 
licensed medicines, surgical devices, and so on." 
You give a couple of examples.  Then you say, in 
the last paragraph -- 

--Result #259--
 Then you say: 
"Further, the present system by which medicines 
are licensed could be undermined if medical experts
believe that they may be more open to litigation. 
They might be unwilling to attest that new drugs or
medicines should be licensed, thus depriving patien ts
of the opportunity of benefiting from medical 
advances.  Finally if we were to offer what would i n 
effect be no fault compensation to this group, we w ill 
rightly be accused of inequity.  There are many oth ers 
who (for no fault of the clinicians involved) are 
damaged as a result of medical treatment.  The 
arguments were fully explored in the Pearson 
Commission of 1978 and little has changed since the n 
to convince us that they are no longer valid." 
So you were, is this right -- 

--Result #260--
 It was motivated by concern for the individuals. 
I mean, the bad press you've got to watch out for t he 
way you do it.  There's no point in helping and, yo u 
know, at least responding to one's own feelings, yo u 
know, that we should do something to help if we 
possibly can, and then going -- you know, you might  as 
well mitigate the extent to which you're denounced for 
it in the press. 
With great respect to the Chairman, he faces the 
dilemma we did.  I'm sure the expectation of the 
campaigners is he's going to recommend a large sum of 
compensation is now given to the victims, and I jus t 
warn him that -- I mean, maybe I won't go down this
any further but you won't find instant joy in doing  it 
because there will then be an argument about whethe r 
it is enough.

--Result #261--
 Oh, yes, some of them.  That's what I'm saying.  Bu t 
as -- if -- had we lost a legal action, then you wo uld 
have got down to the assessment of damages.  And th at                                   
 
                             69 would have included -- it would have taken a very l ong 
time -- for every plaintiff trying to see what 
particular consequences that plaintiff had suffered , 
and some financial measure, if you could, of what t hey 
had lost.  I mean, had the Government fought the ca se 
and lost -- we never thought we were going to lose -- 
I don't think the plaintiff's lawyers thought for o ne 
moment they were ever going to win -- but had we 
conceded or been found legally liable, that is the 
kind of calculation you would then have made.  And 
when we paid this, we didn't go out making any sort  of 
great claim saying, "This should deal with everybod y's 
financial problems", and, "The right figure for eve ry 
victim".  Sadly, we couldn't do that.  And we were not 
legally liable. 
And even then, the consequences of starting to 
pay out full compensation to people whose treatment
had gone wrong, regardless of fault -- the Health 
Service only pays out if someone is found to have b een 
negligent.  They are negligence claims.  You have t o 
do that.  You wouldn't have any money left to run t he 
Health Service otherwise.  
And nowadays it's much worse.  We're much more 
litigious nowadays.  Fighting litigation, paying le gal 
costs and compensation, is a quite significant  
170 percentage of the full Health budget nowadays.  It' s 
because society is more litigious nowadays, and als o 
because we made -- in my opinion -- I always 
thought -- I was about the only minister who though t 
it a mistake at the time, as I've been in Health, w e 
introduced this no-win-no-fee rule that people now sue 
on.  So lawyers, they go around organising cases, a nd 
they don't charge a fee to the claimant, so anybody
can afford to do it, you just have to let them use 
your name, and the lawyer goes on the no-win-no-fee
and either takes a percentage of what you win or, i f 
they negotiate a settlement, takes a substantial 
percentage of the settlement for the legal costs.
I'm sorry I'm going on, but that is the reason 
why -- I always anticipated that.  That's why we ha d 
to be so careful that we mustn't start admitting 
fault, admitting blame, (unclear) legal liability. 
Once you start doing that the floodgates open, beca use 
sadly, the Health Service cannot guarantee to cure 
everybody of every ailment for which it gives the b est 
possible treatment in the light of medical knowledg e 
at the time. 

--Result #262--
 "The House will appreciate that, as before, this is
not compensation but a payment which responds to a 
particular and tragic situation. 
"In making this new allocation the Government

of £20,000, as a one-off payment, and then, secondl y, 
to enable --

its course' is not an attractive principle" -- 

--Result #264--
 Well, if we look at the documents, that might becom e 
clear.  Some of the documents fell to go back for 
considerations that they should be disclosed. 
So I'll read the whole document so that I'm not 
accused of being selective: 
"It is an appalling tragedy that so many 
haemophiliacs were infected by HIV as a result of 
their NHS treatment.  For this reason, the Governme nt 
has quite uniquely paid the victims at least £20,00 0 
each to help with their problems and we have paid m ore 
in cases of hardship.  We have made it clear that w e 
will review our expenditure of £34 million so far a nd 
top up the funds of the Macfarlane Trust if that 
becomes necessary.                                  
 
                             3 "In my opinion, on the factual information 
before me at the moment, this tragedy was no one's 
fault.  The doctors and staff gave the patients the
best medical treatment available in the light of th e 
medical knowledge at the time.  The patients could 
have died then if they had not received that 
treatment.  When the blight of AIDS first struck,
haemophiliacs suffered the same appalling consequen ces 
throughout the western world. 
"Today's judgment will enable the Judge to see 
a further batch of documents in addition to those 
already disclosed.  I am advised that they do not 
contain anything which will reveal that anyone was at 
fault.
"It may be argued that we should pay 
compensation to the victims regardless of whether 
anyone in the Health Service or the Department of 
Health was negligent or to blame for the tragedy. 
I believe it would have very grave consequences for
medicine in this country if compensation was paid 
whenever a patient who had been treated properly by
his or her doctors later suffered awful side effect s 
or died.  We rely on the clinical judgment of the 
medical and other professions when patients are 
treated.  This principle of only paying full  
14 compensation when negligence is proved is not uniqu e 
to the case of the haemophiliacs.  It could arise o ver 
and over again whenever a patient suffers a harrowi ng 
experience after receiving treatment.
"In the USA, the practice of medicine is now 
dominated by these issues of compensation and their
resources for health care are cut back as a result.
That should never happen here. 
"If at any stage I am advised that there is 
evidence that this tragedy was probably caused by t he 
fault of someone in the NHS or in my Department or in 
one of its agencies, the Government will pay 
compensation for the victims of that error.  If, as
I believe, the NHS and the Department are blameless , 
we will maintain the payments to the Macfarlane Tru st 
that we have already put in hand to give exceptiona l 
help to the victims and their families." 
So that's the first document.  I'm going to ask 
you to look at another -- 

--Result #265--
 I'm just going to read out some extracts of this on e 
and then ask my questions about the two documents. 
So we can see your answer where you refer to it 
being a procedural sort of hearing and a technical 
argument, and then you say this: 
"... in my opinion [this is the fourth line of 
your answer], as far as I am aware, those documents
contain nothing which will help the haemophiliacs 
establish, what I believe to be their mistaken clai m, 
this tragedy was the fault either of the health 
service or any of the doctors or the licensing 
agencies at the people against whom they brought th e                                   
 
                             7 claim." 
Then if we go down to your next answer, you say: 
"Had they struck it out at this stage the result 
would have been all that protracted suffering and s o 
that will be caused if a long legal action results 
would of course have been saved.  They are entitled  to 
bring their claim.  But on all the evidence ..." 
I'm sorry, I've missed out an answer, Soumik, 
apologies. 
If you leave it on screen as it is, that will be 
great. 
So I'll go back to the first of your answers on 
screen.
"We're certainly not stringing out the legal 
proceedings and our reaction to this tragedy to the
haemophiliacs has been to pay each of them at least
£20,000 with more in cases of hardship and we have 
spent a great deal of money in trying to alleviate all 
the suffering that has occurred.  They are persisti ng 
on bringing a legal action trying to demonstrate th at 
it was fault  that gave rise to this tragedy, try to 
get much bigger sums of compensation and, we are no t 
able to concede that ..."
And then if we go to the next answer: 
"Had they struck it out at this stage the result  
18 would have been all that protracted suffering and s o 
that will be caused if a long legal action results 
would of course have been saved.  They are entitled  to 
bring their claim.  But on all the evidence and all
the legal advice before me there is no negligence, it 
was nobody's fault and we cannot pay up very large 
sums of money in such circumstances.  It would have
very grave effects to the National Health Service a nd 
for the practice of medicine in this country." 
Then if we go to the next long answer, pick it 
up about six lines down, you say: 
"In this case, in my opinion, the people 
concerned were given the best medical treatment 
available - the same treatment they would have got 
from any other part of the world.  Their lives were
prolonged by that treatment, but unfortunately, and
tragically, a side effect ensued with the result th at 
many of them are now HIV positive and suffering fro m 
AIDS .....  If every time a patient is given the be st 
medical treatment available and then that treatment
goes wrong without anybody's fault after everybody has 
done their best then the National Health Service wo uld 
become like the American system." 
And you continue to discuss that. 
Lord Clarke, the first question I want to ask  
19 having regards to those two documents, so the press
release given on 20 September and then the intervie w, 
was this part, as it were, of what we saw referred to 
as a possible strategy in the documents we looked a t 
yesterday, of a public relations offensive, trying 
to -- 

--Result #266--
 I was invited to give an interview.  I'm obviously 
explaining -- as I say, I'd had nothing to do,
personally, with the PII, and I didn't -- I don't 
think I knew then.  I don't think I ever knew exact ly 
what documents the Permanent Secretary had claimed it 
for.  But the way in which things work, the civil 
servants don't go out, it's the ministers, some 
minister's got to go out and explain the Department 's 
position if you have, you know, something like this , 
where there's some media reporter wants to report i t. 
So I was explaining the Department's position and 
actually what you've read out, I mean, I've read it , 
and I -- if it was all contemporary I would say the
same things again. 
It's just answering a criticism which the 
journalist is obviously determined to put.  I mean,
some of his questions are extraordinary.  But as 
I say, I -- I forgive the journalist, he's obviousl y 
doing his best and he feels very great sympathy for 
20 the victims, and he is obviously -- he's sort of --
kind of insisting this is all sort of trying to den y 
them some redress or something.  But I hope -- I th ink 
it's all perfectly clear.  There seems to be a -- 
there's one slip that I found a moment ago with the
wrong word at one point but that may be a typing er ror 
in the transcript.  But nothing serious.  It doesn' t 
matter. 
I've done my best in this, and that was part of 
my job, I'm acting as the spokesman for the Departm ent 
and trying to explain what these preliminary proces ses 
which the lawyers representing the Department had 
advised we should take, and which, on these 
preliminary stages, the plaintiffs had won and our 
lawyers had lost the argument -- but they're perfec tly 
entitled to argue it -- but what actually it was ab out 
and what approach we were taking.  And in particula r, 
I keep stressing all the way through this, if there
was any evidence showing negligence, if there was a ny 
evidence showing fault, we would pay full 
compensation, as we always do.  And as we always di d. 
And I tried to explain the policy with that and 
the fact you can't just pay out compensation in all
those cases where there's no fault on the part of t he 
doctors, there's no part on the fault [sic] of the                                   
 
                             1 Health Authority, and there's no fault on the part of 
the Department, and that -- that is the thing we're
still maintaining, you know, that's still -- still the 
approach today, and I think any other approach woul d 
be quite impossible.  You'd destroy the Health 
Service.

--Result #267--
 If we go to JEVA0000065, please, Soumik. 
This is an extract from the first edition, 
I think, of your book, of your autobiography and 
I just want to ask you about the third paragraph,
a change that was made to it.  You say in the third
paragraph, in this version: 
"The haemophiliacs who spent the rest of their 
lives with this disease were eventually given 
compensation by John Major's government." 
Then you go on to talk about the continuing 
campaign for more generous compensation for their 
suffering and to help them with the cost of their 
illness. 
36 As I understand it, Lord Clarke, concern was 
expressed to you about the use of the word 
"compensation" because no compensation, no assessme nt 
of need or -- 

--Result #268--
   Sir, I've one further question I'm proposing 
to ask from those suggested to me. 
Lord Clarke, it's this: you made observations in 
your evidence, I think yesterday, which were 
suggestive that you saw the Inquiry as a vehicle fo r 
campaigners to advance compensation claims.  Do you
accept that you have no knowledge whatsoever of the
motivations either of campaigners or of the multipl e 
infected and affected people, many of whom would no
doubt say, if you were to ask them, that they are 
fighting for truth and accountability? 

--Result #269--
 I think that's a -- I hope that's a slight parody o f 
what I said yesterday, but obviously I'm not 
attacking -- not attacking the motivation of the 
people involved.  I mean, the victims and their 
relatives have my sympathy and support, but, you kn ow, 
one of the things that's been referred here is -- 
well, it's been your terms of reference, like you t old 
me yesterday, as to whether more compensation shoul d 
be given, because more compensation, as I understan d 
it, was being sought, perhaps by lawyers acting on 
behalf of the victims, from the Government, and the  -- 
and someone in Theresa May's Government decided to                                   
 
                             05 transfer the decision on whether or not to give any
more money to this Inquiry. 
But, I mean, I am not traducing -- you know, 
trying to traduce or undermine the motives of any o f 
the people coming -- I do understand.  I am sorry 
that, you know, 30, 40 years later they're having s uch 
difficulties in living with the consequences for th em 
and their families of the tragedy.  And campaigning , 
I suspect, is something of an outlet for their 
feelings about this disaster that struck them or 
someone they've lost. 

--Result #270--
 Well, we're a team, yes -- so yes, I mean, greatly 
regrettable that the Department doesn't -- I'm not 
saying -- don't get me wrong.  I'm just explaining 
what the factual situation is.  I'm not trying to  
210 escape saying, "It wasn't me, guv".  I don't think the 
Department did anything wrong.  I've never heard 
anybody suggest anything that in the real world 
a minister or a civil servant might have done that 
would have prevented it.  I've already said, had we
taken the step we now know would have saved lives, 
we'd have been treated with outrage by the Haemophi lia 
Society and most haemophiliacs by denying them thei r 
Factor VIII.  There just wasn't the evidence to 
suggest that. 
I don't think the Department did anything wrong, 
I don't think there was anything the Department cou ld 
have done that it didn't do.  It's the current way of 
the life now.  It's part of the current political 
scene, that somebody has got to be summonsed, to us e 
the old saying.  Someone has got to be found to be 
blamed for this, and it's all the fault of the 
Government, really.  Or sometimes it's all the faul t 
of the Tory party; it depends who is in power at th e 
time.  I don't think we did anything really wrong.  We 
all now, with the benefit of hindsight, know what 
happened.  
I hope the ministers in the present Government 
know they're going to be put through all this on 
Covid.  There will be a public Inquiry, it'll take  
211 five years, spend tens of millions of pounds, and t he 
media will be urging it on to get Boris Johnson hun g 
from the yard arm, and to give compensation to 
everybody who ever had Covid. 
That's the way of the world.  In the real world, 
the calmness of this Inquiry, that was my involveme nt. 
If anybody failed to do anything, yes, I was a memb er 
of the Department of Health, I was part of the team .
The Secretary of State when you come on to me being  my 
Secretary of State, overall responsibility, in the end 
the buck stops with you, you're not only the head o f 
everything, you're the last resort, you are the per son 
overall responsible.  And in a big department like the 
Department of Health, one of it -- some of your 
juniors, some of your officials are going to make 
a mistake.  They're going to make a pig's ear of 
something, you probably won't have a clue what it w as 
until you're told when you walk into the office one
morning and you have to start trying to sort it out
and you're responsible -- you can't get away from t he 
fact that you're the last resort, Secretary of Stat e 
is overall responsibility. 
As Minister of State, as a middle-ranking 
minister, I don't seek to escape any responsibility , 
and if something went wrong, then I, you know -- I' m  
212 implicated.  I share the blame.  But my actual 
personal role is the one that's described, and 
I never -- I wasn't the one holding policy discussi ons 
and taking decisions about whether we import or not .

The submission itself from Mr Canavan is dated

Paragraph 1 says:
"PS(H) may recall that Graham Ross of J Keith Park
& Co has written to 
Ministers 
on several occasions
pressing for compensation for the blood transfusion
recipients infected with HIV.  With Ministers agreement,
officials have taken over the correspondence.
Graham Ross expressed some concern at this but has been
assured 
that
 Ministers will be told of any new
arguments.  This submission considers a point of
particular concern to Mr Ross that preserving the
anonymity of blood donors could make it difficult for
the blood transfusion recipients to seek redress through
the courts."
I'll read 
the
 second:
"In the submission we are also reporting the 
RHA's
[Regional Health Authorit
y's
] willingness to take the
lead in negotiating a deal 
to settle the blood
transfusion issue, should Ministers wish to seek such
a settlement.
"
Then the recommendation in paragraph 3:
"We do not consider that these developments in
themselves warrant a change in the Government's
position.  However
, 
should Ministers be minded to seek
a way of settling the blood transfusion issue
 
the
J Keith Park
 
and RHA developments may be helpful in
 
3
reducing the risk of wider repercussions."
The
 submission then goes 
on 
to set out in more
detail the issue about anonymity of donors and the
impact 
that might have on the ability 
to litigate
.  
I'm not going to read any of that out.  
If we 
just go to page 3, please.  If we 
pick it up
at paragraph 9, conclusions.  At the top of the page:
"In the view of officials, the arguments about
donor anonymity do not warrant a concession to the blood
transfusion recipients infected with HIV.  However
 
if
Ministers were minded to seek a way of settling the
issue then the arguments might be used to prevent the
settlement as a necessary measure to protect our
voluntary blood donor system.  However
 
any such argument
would have to be used with caution as any erosion of
public interest immunity principle could have serious
implications for all Government Departments and for
other public bodies.  There would need to be
consultation with these other interests."
Then if we go down to the bottom of the page under
the heading "Decisions Required":

unchanged by the arguments about donor anonymity?
"
ii) he wishes any further action taken at this
stage to pursue the RHAs offer?"
Lord Waldegrave
, 
as we 
saw
 from the covering
submission
, 
this appears to have been passed up the
ministerial chain to you, 
but 
the documents I think
don't tell us what
,
 if any
,
 decision you took in
response to this.  Do you have any independent
recollection of it?

--Result #272--

Then continuing with the minute:
 
7
"
4.  
We must also assume that 
Treasury
 would not
entertain any further bids on the Reserve for additional
cases.
"
5.  
On policy, this extension of eligibility will
leave us with a less secur
e r
ingfence than for
haemophiliacs.  We believe that two groups of people,
those infected with hepatitis and those 
treated 
with
human growth hormone, are currently preparing legal
action against the Department.  Both groups will be able
to argue that
 
like the HIV cases
 
they were entitled to
expect safe treatment.  And 
the
 hepatitis cases will
also be able to point to infection through blood.  So we
will be more vulnerable than 
we
 now are on the no-fault
compensation issue."
Then we can see if we go further down, that's the
end of the minute.
So it looks from those two documents,
Lord Waldegrave, that by the end of November of 1991,
you had taken the decision, discussed it with Mr Heppell
and others, that the time had come to change the
departmental line and extend financial support to those
infected with HIV through transfusion.  Do you have any
recollection of exactly how and when that came about
?
Because
, as 
I say
, 
there's a dearth of documents really
between August and November
.

--Result #273--

If we go to paragraph 8 we can see the recommendation to
Mr Mellor is:
"We recommend that you try to dissuade
Mr Waldegrave and colleagues from offering
a compensation scheme.  It may seem attractive to him in
the short-term
.  
But in the longer term
, 
it could cost
much more by leading to a no-fault compensation scheme -
even if one restricted to medical negligence."
So the suggestion is Mr Mellor tries to talk you
out of it
, 
if I can put it that way.
If we go back to the first page and just read the
handwritten entry:
"This 
is 
a longstanding dilemma
.  
It is not
comfortable to deny compensation to this group when the
haemophiliacs can get it.  But giving compensation to
them 
[
would
]
 mean another long stride down the slipp
ery
slope to no-fault compensation generally.  I am afraid,
therefore, 
our
 
advice has to 
be against 
[
it
]
."
I will check whose handwriting that is.

--Result #274--

Sir Christopher France, yes, sorry.
2 December 1991, 
to your Private Office
.  
And if we
go down to the text of it
, 
it says:
"
1.  
I
 have 
seen Mr Heppell's minute of 29
November.  I
 
very much share his misgivings on the
policy case for a concession here (and the finance would
not be easy either).
"2.  
It is never very comfortable to resist claims
for compensation from those who have encountered major
problems through no fault of their
 
own or anyone else.
But unless Government is prepared to 
draw a
 line and
stick to it, it will end up with a de facto
(very
 
expensive) no
-
fault compensation system
.
"
3.  
The ringfence around the haemophiliacs is
bound to be attacked
, 
but we are unlikely ever to find
a better one if we abandon it.  The haemophiliacs were
doubly disadvantaged by their existing, hereditary
disease which already affected their position on
employment, insurance and the like.  They can be
 
15
separate from other victims of medical accidents, but
the next defensible boundary is not easy to see.
I advise long reflection before 
we
 move further in to
no-fault compensation for medical accidents.  Is this
really the most pressing marginal case 
for 
the
deployment of money from the health programme?"
Now, you've told us you would have regular
meetings, the top of the office meetings, with
Sir Christopher and others.  This 
is, 
I think
, 
perhaps
the only example we have of Sir Christopher putting his
views on this issue in writing.  Does the fact that it
was set out in this formal way rather than simply being
conveyed to you in your weekly meetings a reflection of
the extent to which he was opposed to your proposal?

--Result #275--

If 
we
 just pick matters up in your statement
,
 please
,
WITN5288001, if we go to page 88, paragraph 4125, you
say this, and it's referring to Christopher France's
advice:
"While I do not now actively remember seeing this
advice
, 
I would certainly have done so at the time.
This was advice coming from (respectively) the
Permanent
 
Secretary [Sir Christopher France] and
the
 
Deputy
 
Secretary
 (
Grade 2) Civil Servant
[Strachan Heppell] heading the policy area, both of whom
that
 put their advice in formal minutes.  The Inquiry
asks why I 'rejected' their advice.  They were right to
warn
 me in the terms they did
, 
and I would have taken
very
 serious note of their advice.  I would have been
well aware of the dangers of widening the policy
, 
and
their advice would - appropriately - have been
a force
ful
 reminder of those risks.  Ultimately,
however, it was for ministers to judge the balance of
risks.  Here the balance was between trying to maintain
a distinction between haemophiliacs and blood
transfusion patients both infected with HIV by
NHS
 
treatment which the 'court of public opinion'
rejected, versus the weakening of the defences against
pressure for no-fault compensation which we believed to
be an unacceptable outcome for the reasons 
(
agreed by
 
20
Parliament
) 
put forward in opposition to Rosie Barnes
'
Bill. 
 
Such difficult 
judgements 
are I think the essence
of democra
tic 
government.  Just as my senior officials
were right to 
warn
, I think that the Government was
right to concede and run the risk on the no-fault
compensation concerns.  As I was later to express it to
the Chief Secretary, I
 
believed that it was politically
and morally the correct course.  I was 
very
 aware of the
particular stigma and fear that surrounded AIDS at the
time
, 
and I did see this as a potentially distinguishing
feature from other cases raised in the debate on
no-fault compensation."
The balance that you identify there
, 
the balance
of risks being a matter for ministers to judge,
presumably -- and this is a more generally question,
Lord Waldegrave -- the more senior the Minister
, 
the
easier or perhaps the less difficult it may be for that
minister to consider but reject the advice of senior
officials?

you

This 
is 1

January 1992 from Mr Mellor.  It refers
to your letter and to the letters from Ian Lang,
Peter Brooke and David Hunt, and then Mr Mellor says
this:
"
2.  
I understand why you want to provide
compensation for this unfortunate group and
I sympathise.  But I also have serious reserv
ations
about whether it would be possible realistically to 
ring
fence
 any such compensation.  There are a range of other
groups who have also suffered as a result of treatment
under the NHS where there
 is 
no
 question of negligence.
By compensating those acquiring HIV from blood
transfusion, we will be taking a further long stride
towards no-fault compensation in general.
"3.  
Virginia Bottomley put forward a good defence
of our current position in the adjournment 
debate called
by
 Gavin Strang on 20
 
December.  It would be difficult
to reverse our position so soon after that clear
statement
.  
"4.  
But I also have to say that all this 
is
overtaken by the extent of doctors
' 
and den
tists'
overpayments in the current year.  You will appreciate
that the latest news about 
the 
further 
over
payments to
 
28
dentists this year has come as a 
very unpleasant shock.
Your officials have now told mine that the 
gross
overpayment
 
to dentists this year is likely to be
a staggering £8,000 per dentist at the very least.  That
comes to 
well
 over £100 million which you will be
looking to me to provide from the Reserve.  I have also
learn
ed 
from officials 
that 
there will be 
claims for
overpayments this year for Scotland and Wales.
It brings the 
cumulative overpayment to doctors and
dentists to over half a billion pounds
, 
more 
than the
total increases many 
colleagues received in their 1991
Survey settlements.
"5.  
In these circumstances, you leave 
me no 
room
to help you or the other health departments by providing
additional access to the Reserve for the blood
transfusion patients.  I cannot

 agree to
what you propose."

And I don't think we need to go to the all of the
further documents but
, 
again for the transcript, you
wrote to Mr Mellor 
on 
12
 
February
, 
it's DHSC0002582_003
,
in which you explained you'd look at the programme to
work out where you would find the money from and there's
some additional correspondence on that which I don't
think we need to look at
.
If we then come to the announcement in Parliament
,
to complete the chronological picture
, 
it's at
 
35
DHSC0003625_040.  It's a written answer
17
 
February 1992, and if we just go down to you are
response to the question, you say:
"Pursuant to the reply of 14
 
November 1991 at
column
 
656; I have decided that 
the
 special provision
already made for those with haemophilia and HIV is to be
extended to those who have been infected with HIV as
a
 
result of National Health Service blood transfusion or
tissue transfer in the United Kingdom.  The payments
will also apply to any of their spouses, partners and
children to whom their infection may have been passed
on.  The rates of payment are shown in the table.
Similar help will be available throughout the UK.
"The Government have never accepted the argument
for a general scheme of no
 
fault compensation for
medical accidents, as such a scheme would be unworkable
and unfair.  That remains our position
.
"We made special provision for those with
haemophilia and HIV because of their very special
circumstances.  It has been argued that this special
provision should be extended to include those who have
become
 infected with HIV through blood or tissue
transfer within the UK.  I have considered very
carefully all the circumstances and the arguments which
have been put to us.  I have concluded that it would be
 
36
right to recognise that this group
, 
who share the
tragedy of those with haemophilia in becoming infect
ed
with HIV through medical treatment within the UK
, 
is
also a very special case."
Then over the page:
"The circumstances of each infected transfusion or
tissue recipient will need to be considered individually
to establish that their treatment in the UK was the
source of their infection."
The next paragraph then deals with the
establishment of the panel and the work on the mechanics
of dealing with claims.
The third paragraph explains that:
"Parliamentary authority for making these payments
will be sought through Suppl
y 
Estimates and the
confirming 
Appropriation Act
.  
On the basis of the
reported cases the estimated cost could be 
£
12 million
.
However
, 
I cannot be certain about the cost
, 
as numbers
of valid claims are not known
.
"
And that picks up on the issue we picked up a few
minutes ago
 --

--Result #278--

Can I then turn to a handful of broader issues.  One of
the concerns about the establishment of precedent and
the impact in terms of the policy against no-fault
compensation was based on an assumption that there was
no fault involved on the part of the NHS or on
governments.

--Result #279--

Would it, having regard to the material we've looked at,
be right to understand
, 
then, 
that
 obviously there were
cases where there might be negligence and legal
liability and so compensation might follow in those
cases, there was the policy against no-fault
compensation.

--Result #280--
 Then we look at the content of it, because it was 
copied to you, and it really helps us, I think, pic k 
up the decision-making process.  So the first 
paragraph explains: 
"I am writing to let you know how I intend to 
handle the issue of compensation for haemophiliacs 
with the HIV virus and the media campaign which wil l 
be launched shortly on their behalf by the 
Haemophilia Society of Great Britain." 
The next paragraph then explains in the first 
line that:
"... the campaign will be emotive and highly 
charged.  We will be under considerable parliamenta ry 
and public pressure after the Press launch of the 
campaign in early October and no doubt the issue wi ll 
be active during our Party Conference."  
23 There is then a description of the background in 
the next paragraph.  If we go to the bottom of the 
page, Mr Moore says: 
"The question of Government compensation for 
this group was raised specifically when Norman Fowl er 
and Tony Newton gave evidence earlier this year to the 
Social Services Select Committee.  Whilst Norman an d 
Tony made it quite clear how much they sympathised,
the Government's position was that there has never 
been a general State scheme to compensate those who
suffer adverse effects from medical treatment.
Compensation can only be awarded by the courts if 
negligence is proved.  The full range of social 
security benefits are of course available to those 
haemophiliacs who qualify." 
Then he says this: 
"I have looked at the case for compensation 
again carefully in the light of the impending campa ign 
but have concluded that the line taken with the Soc ial 
Services Committee was right.  Any special 
arrangements for compensation could cost a minimum of 
£3 million and could only be funded at the expense of 
other priorities.  Moreover, it is logically diffic ult 
to distinguish the claim by haemophiliacs from the 
claim of many others damaged in the course of their 
24 medical treatment.  And there is no doubt that 
compensating haemophiliacs would lead to pressure 
from many other groups for similar treatment." 
And then he continues: 
"While all of us must have every sympathy for 
haemophiliacs who have been infected with the HIV 
virus, I do not feel it would be wise to set a gene ral 
precedent by accepting that the Government should 
provide a special compensation scheme. 
"I shall be taking steps to ensure that the case 
for not giving compensation is well understood by t he 
media and by our own supporters.
"I am, of course, very ready to discuss this 
issue with you if you so wish." 
Then he explains that he is copying this minute 
to the Lord President, the Secretaries of State for
Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the 
Chief Secretary and to Sir Robert Armstrong.  So th e 
Chief Secretary at that point in time was you?

--Result #281--
 Now, this wasn't a document that called for any 
particular action or decision by the Prime Minister  or 
indeed by you as Chief Secretary.  As far as you ca n 
recall, was this the first time the question of 
compensation had been raised or brought to your                                   
 
                             5 attention?

--Result #282--
 We'll pick that up as we go through the documents. 
Just for the sake of completeness, Lawrence, if we 
have DHSC0004541_141, we have a letter from Number 10,
dated 28 September 1987, which records that:  
26 "The Prime Minister [who was of course at that 
time Mrs Thatcher] has seen, and noted without 
comment, your Secretary of State's minute of 
24 September ..." 
Then we can see that the letter, in turn, was 
copied to the same recipients of the first letter.
Now, that's September '87, I want to pick it up 
then in the next month with a letter you received, 
I think along with many other MPs, from the 
Haemophilia Society.  It's at HSOC0004760_001. 
So this is a letter 12 October 1987, it's from 
the Reverend Tanner who was chairman of the 
Haemophilia Society.  This is a blank version in th e 
sense it's "Dear [blank]", but we'll see from 
subsequent letters that you were one of the recipie nts 
of it.  He says: 
"I am writing to ask for your support in our 
campaign to help the most tragic victims of the AID S 
crisis, people with haemophilia."
The second paragraph then describes, picking it 
up in the second line: 
"A large number of people were infected as 
a result of treatment by commercially produced 
products, mainly drawn from blood donations given i n 
the US and Third World.  Treatment from this source , 
27 with the attendant risks, was required because the UK 
was not, and still is not, self-sufficient in blood
products despite successive Government promises sin ce 
1977." 
The letter then goes on to talk about the 
effects on those who have been infected.  We can se e 
those listed, I don't propose to read them out.  Th e 
Reverend Tanner explains: 
"57 have AIDS and 41 have died.
"All of this -- in addition to haven't to cope 
with a life threatening disorder  -- haemophilia.  
"The Government is responsible for this 
situation.  All these people were infected as a res ult 
of treatment through the NHS ..."
Then he adds: 
"... despite the House of Commons Social 
Services Committee accepting that:
"'Calls for compensation for haemophiliacs and 
others who have become HIV positive as a consequenc e 
of infected blood transfusion and for special life 
insurance arrangements for haemophiliacs deserve 
careful consideration.' 
"The Government has not, as yet, volunteered any 
form of support, financial or otherwise.  At presen t 
they are hiding behind the cloak of the courts in  
28 saying that they are not liable for compensation. 
However, there is a clear moral case that the 
Government should provide recompense." 
Then he sets out further details in that regard. 
Now, we can see, I think, that you undoubtedly 
received that letter from HSOC0003584.  This is you
writing -- is this correct -- in your capacity as M P, 
rather than as Chief Secretary to the Treasury?

--Result #283--
 When you have a letter like that, you're essentiall y  
32 asking the Government to change its policy.  Minist ers 
just don't do that and remain ministers, it's just not 
the way one behaves.  In terms of private nature, y ou 
may lobby very hard for something but you don't say  -- 
you don't want to get any headlines in the paper,
"Minister X attacks Government policy on Y".  So yo u 
don't say that publicly. 
What I actually said to him at the time was that 
I appreciated the serious nature of the issue, and 
indeed I did, because it was becoming more serious as 
we shall see no doubt in a few moments.  So I was v ery 
sympathetic and remained sympathetic.  But until we
had changed policy it was not appropriate for me as
a minister to indicate that, and nor did I. 
The point about no fault compensation was always 
quite a sound point in terms of precedent.  What wa s 
a much less sound point was the matter I referred t o 
a moment ago, that there are times when your instin cts 
override what is existing policy and then you try a nd 
change policy within Government, because you're 
sympathetic to a particular cause.  Now, if I may s ay 
so, John Moore is no longer with us and the impress ion 
would have been given by the earlier letter from Jo hn 
that you quoted that he was unsympathetic.  
I have to tell you he wasn't, he wasn't                                   
 
                             3 unsympathetic he was echoing the Government's 
effective line on the legality of the issue, whilst
discussing and wondering whether something more sho uld 
be done about it, as did his successors.  And as 
Chief Secretary, of course, I was aware of what the y 
were thinking privately but not saying publicly.  T he 
reason they did that, of course, is because until t hey 
have all of the facts they don't want to inspire ho pe 
that is not met or create controversy that is 
avoidable. 
So it is a circumstance, a system that 
governments from the dawn of time have actually 
operated until a change of policy is privately agre ed. 
Now, at that time, I replied to Mr Watters, and 
I remember his letter, because it came so soon afte r 
the one from the Reverend Tanner.  I was sympatheti c 
of the Government's position -- of the position of the 
Haemophilia Society, and it was being discussed 
privately. 
John Moore had said at one stage there was not 
a good case for compensation for reasons of precede nt. 
He did not rule out, nor did he say he'd ruled out,
compensation in view of the circumstances of those who 
were infected.  That is why his position seemed rat her 
hardline and it was a good deal less hardline, 
34 if I may speak belatedly in his defence, than it 
immediately seemed. 
Pretty soon afterwards, if I recall, 
Tony Newton, who I think was the Minister of State,
and John Moore, were due to meet The 
Haemophilia Society, and they had discussed that wi th 
me and with others before they went.  But only in 
broad outline they said that they were going. 
There were many questions before they went that 
they weren't in a position to answer.  And so 
I advised them to be cautious about those particula r 
questions, because we wished to be sure of our fact s 
before any policy was changed.

--Result #284--
 I can tell you exactly what I meant by it.  Conside r 
the questions that were unanswered and had to be 
answered.  You'll note I didn't say that we shouldn 't 
offer it, I said we shouldn't offer a response unti l 
we'd thoroughly considered the pros and cons of doi ng  
42 it.  And those pros and cons were principally how m uch 
money should it be, to whom should it go, when shou ld 
it go, in what form should it go, what trap doors 
would be open to present and future claims on medic al 
issues, what was the Law Officers' views on the 
implication of offering effectively no fault 
compensation both now and the future?
Now, there was no suggestion, I think either by 
them or by me, that there wasn't going to be some 
compensation but we had to be aware of what we were
doing, if we were going to get the compensation rig ht 
and how we dealt with it right.  And, frankly, the 
Department of Health should have examined that matt er 
with the Chief Secretary before they had their meet ing 
with The Haemophilia Society, but they hadn't done so.
I think the meeting had come in a bit of a rush for
one reason or another, and they hadn't done so. 
But before we could decide what help should be 
given and how the help should be given and to whom the 
help should be given and in what form, we had to 
answer those particular questions, and that was the
purpose of my cautionary letter to them, saying, 
"Listen now, and then when you come back we can 
discuss further".

--Result #285--
 I don't think the Government gained very much of th e 
sort of the horror people were facing.  I mean, the re 
is no amount of compensation you can give that coul d 
actually compensate for what had happened to them. 
What had happened to them was incredibly bad luck, 
awful, and it was not something that anybody was 
unsympathetic to.

--Result #286--
 Just to carry through the decision-making in relati on 
to the requests that had come from Tony Newton and 
John Moore, we can see then that the matter was 
considered by the Cabinet Subcommittee on AIDS on 
10 November 1987.  Could we have CABO0100016_011,  
44 please? 
This is the set of minutes of the meeting held 
on 10 November 1987, "Cabinet Home and Social Affai rs 
Committee Subcommittee on AIDS", and we can see if we 
look at those attending, it's chaired by 
Lord Whitelaw, then we have a number of 
Secretaries of State in attendance.  If we just go 
slightly down, we can see John Moore was there and you 
were there in your capacity as Chief Secretary to t he 
Treasury.  We also have a reference there to 
Donald Acheson, the Chief Medical Officer, being in
attendance.  If we could go, please, Lawrence to 
page 6, we can see the heading "Special Financial 
Assistance for Haemophiliacs".  Then the minutes 
record: 
"The subcommittee considered a Memorandum by the 
Secretary of State ... on whether the Government 
should provide special financial assistance for 
haemophiliacs." 
Now, I'm not going to take you to the memorandum 
but, for the sake of the transcript, so that others
can look at it if they wish to, it's JEVA0000021.  In 
fact, the minutes largely set out what it was that 
John Moore was saying. 
If we pick it up just in that                                   
 
                             5 paragraph beginning "The Secretary of State for Soc ial 
Services said", it's about nine lines down, Sir Joh n, 
where it's recorded: 
"He had continued the policy of his predecessor 
in resisting special financial assistance for 
haemophiliacs infected by HIV on the ground that th ere 
had never been a general state scheme to compensate
those who had suffered adverse effects from medical
treatment.  However, he was now very clearly of the
view that the position was not sustainable unless 
concessions were made.  The Haemophilia Society ...
had recently launched a campaign for Government 
compensation ... this had attracted a great deal of
support in Parliament and elsewhere.  The Society h ad 
been given advice by Counsel that it was most unlik ely 
that liability could be proved against the Governme nt 
but they had successfully got across their contenti on 
that the moral fault lay with the Government for 
failing to secure self-sufficiency in blood product s. 
Whilst this was a tendentious argument, it was 
difficult to refute it convincingly." 
Just pausing there, Sir John, before we look at 
the rest of the document and the rest of the 
discussion, you'll recall that the letters that we 
looked at from The Haemophilia Society, rather than 
46 simply calling for no fault compensation, had actua lly 
made out a case of fault, not necessarily legal 
liability, but fault on the part of the Government or 
the NHS for failing to secure self-sufficiency in 
blood products.  We see John Moore then saying, 
describing that as a "tendentious argument" but 
"difficult to refute it convincingly".
It's not clear, I think, from the 
contemporaneous documentation that certainly I've s een 
what was meant by that or what investigations had b een 
undertaken as to the alleged failure to secure 
self-sufficiency.  Do you recall that being a subje ct 
of concern or discussion?

--Result #287--
 Risks to Government spending from other completely 
unrelated claims once we had broken the dam of not 
paying out for no fault -- no legal fault 
compensation.  Once we moved to an ex gratia paymen t,
we had opened up, potentially, a whole range of oth er 
options where people may come to the Government or sue 
the Government or whatever in terms of getting 
compensation for something wholly unrelated to heal th, 
as well as conceivably related to other aspects of 
health.  That's what it's about.  It's the same 
argument about no legal fault compensation.

put up on screen Tony Newton's announcement of the

We can see the date of the announcement is 
16 November 1987, and we can see, on the left-hand 
column, it's being made by Tony Newton and if we ju st 
go a little further down that column, please, 
Lawrence, we can see the penultimate paragraph on t he 
screen:  
64 "The grant of £10 million is being made from the 
reserve." 
So there is the announcement.  Can we just go 
back to the whole page, please?  You'll then see, 
Sir John, and Chair, bottom of the page, Robin Cook
responds, and if go to the top of the next column, 
please, we can see the question being asked by 
Robin Cook was: 
"Will the Minister explain how he has costed the 
fund and come up with £10 million, or was it 
a convenient round figure?  Is he aware that, per 
head, it represents just over £8,000 for every pers on 
infected and that that is less than half the capita l 
sum that is paid by his Department in the cases of 
vaccine damage?  Is he satisfied that such a modest
sum is enough, particularly when the most pressing 
need for the families of the victims is to keep a r oof 
over their heads by clearing a mortgage." 
Then in the next paragraph, Robin Cook asks if 
the Minister will undertake to review with The 
Haemophilia Society the size of the fund.  And then
Mr Newton's answer, if we just go a little further 
down the column, he says, in the second paragraph: 
"On a number of occasions I have commented on 
the difficulty of a compensation scheme.  This is n ot                                   
 
                             5 a compensation scheme.  That must be made clear.  I t 
is a recognition of a special and unique combinatio n 
of circumstances, and I am glad to make that 
recognition. 
"On the matter of the £10 million, we arrived at 
a broad estimate of a sum that we felt would give 
significant help to the group affected, recognising
that to calculate in terms of a specific sum per 
individual would not take account of the great 
differences between the circumstances of the 
individuals affected.  That is one reason why we ha ve 
not attempted to have a regulated scheme.  For 
example, some may be young single men, others may b e 
older men with families, and so on.  On that basis we 
have arrived at this sum and this flexibility of 
scheme." 
Then he says in the next paragraph: 
"It will be up to the society [which is of 
course the Macfarlane Trust ultimately] to decide h ow 
to administer the £10 million."  
There is then a debate that continues with some 
expressing the view that the sum was less than 
adequate, or rather Scrooge-like.  But that's the 
Parliamentary debate, in any event, for the sake of
completeness. 
66 Sir John, if there is any comment you wish to 
make on that, please do.  I don't have a specific 
question I just wanted to draw attention to it to 
complete the issues we were looking at before the 
break?

--Result #289--
 So if we move then two years forward in time to the
autumn of 1989, by which time you had taken up the 
post of Chancellor of the Exchequer.  If we can sta rt 
with HMTR0000001_005. 
Now, this is a minute from Mr Saunders in the 
Treasury, dated 13 November 1989, and it is, as 
I understand your statement, addressed to your 
Principal Private Secretary.  The heading is "Autum n 
Statement: Haemophiliacs and AIDS", and it says in the 
first paragraph: 
"You asked for a line to take should the 
question be raised of compensation for haemophiliac s 
who contracted AIDS through treatment with infected
blood products.  The following is based on briefing
which was supplied for Prime Minister's Questions 
yesterday." 
Then the line to take is that essentially it's  
67 a matter for the Secretary of State for Health.  Th ere 
is reference then to the £10 million: 
"The Department of Health has always made clear 
that if representations were made that further 
contritions were necessary, it would always be 
prepared to consider them." 
Then if we just go over the page, we can pick it 
up under the heading "Not For Use", so this, I thin k, 
is for your background information, rather than for
public dissemination.  Paragraph 5 refers to 
consideration being given by Mr Clarke: 
"... who was said to be sceptical about the need 
for any further payment ... Mrs Bottomley is said t o 
think that the Government must be seen to be doing 
more." 
Now, this is the genesis of what became 
a further payment to the Macfarlane Trust in late 
1989.  As I understand it, Sir John, you don't know  if 
you saw this at the time, but you think you would h ave 
probably had some form of discussion with the 
Chief Secretary, who by then was Norman Lamont, abo ut 
it; is that right? 

--Result #290--
 No.  There is attached to the document that we're j ust 
about to look at there, is a later version of the 
draft letter which doesn't include any reference to
you, so I don't think -- it's by no means clear 
whether there was a discussion with you.
So this is 15 October and there is a reference 
to there are going to be debates in Parliament in t he 
House of Commons and the House of Lords. 
I just want to pick up paragraph 2:
"Department of Health officials assure me the 
Government line on both occasions will remain exact ly 
as it has been hitherto.  There will be no suggesti on 
that the Government might be willing to negotiate a n 
out-of-court settlement." 
So this is really just to show the chronology  
87 of events, Sir John, in the weeks before you became
Prime Minister.  So that's the position set out in 
this minute.
Then if we look at DHSC0046936_035, please, we 
can see this is 16 October 1990.  
And if we go just a little further down the 
page, please, Lawrence, right-hand column, we have 
Mr Wallace asks a question: 
"Does the Prime Minister agree that the 
honourable and decent way forward in the tragic cas e 
of the 1,200 haemophiliacs suffering from the AIDS 
virus to is to offer far more generous compensation
than has been the case up to now, rather than 
continuing to fund ever-increasing fees for lawyers  to 
argue the toss over the matter?"
Then we have the Prime Minister's answer: 
"The Government have already made available some 
£34 million to the haemophiliacs who are suffering 
from this very grievous happening, as an ex gratia 
payment without prejudice to their taking legal act ion 
in the courts.  Obviously, we wish to know the lega l 
position before any further payment is considered."
So I don't have a question for you, Sir John, 
that's to show where things have got to by the midd le 
of October 1990.  
88 Now, you became Prime Minister 28 November 1990. 
But before we look at, then, how this issue came to
your attention as Prime Minister, can you just help  us 
a little with understanding more the organisation o f 
Number 10, and how it might be that decisions or 
documents might come to you as Prime Minister and w hat 
might not be put before you.  Was there any particu lar 
rule of thumb?

--Result #291--
 Now, around a week after you became Prime Minister,
Mr Waldegrave, who was Secretary of State for Healt h,
wrote to you, and if we can just follow through the
correspondence over the days that then followed. 
We start with HMTR0000002_016, please, Lawrence.
So this is addressed to you.  If we go to the 
second page first of all, we can see it's dated 
5 December 1990 and it's "WW", so William Waldegrav e. 
If we go back to the preceding page, we can see 
Mr Waldegrave said this: 
"Further to your exchange with Terrence Higgins 
at yesterday's Questions, I am writing to let you k now 
the current position on the HIV litigation involvin g 
haemophiliacs." 
Then he sets out a number of points by way of 
background.  The third paragraph refers to the two 
payments previously made.  The fourth 
paragraph explains: 
"However, around 770 infected haemophiliacs and 
190 of their partners and close relatives are suing
the Government and the Health Authorities for damag es, 
alleging negligence. 
91 "The main Court hearing has been set or March 
1991, and is expected to last for six months.  The 
trial judge took the exceptional step of suggesting
that both sides should consider a compromise 
settlement.  In its formal rejection, the Departmen t 
said that the moral and compassionate arguments had
already been recognised by the Government, and drew
attention to the dangers of creating an expectation
that all those injured as an unintended effect of N HS 
treatment would receive compensation without having  to 
prove negligence.  However, the co-ordinating 
committee for the Plaintiffs' solicitors have now p ut 
forward a proposal which would, in effect, involve 
a total cost to the Government of some £50 million.
This is very much earlier than their earlier propos al 
of nearly £100m, and may, I am advised, represent t he 
fact that the 'doves' amongst their lawyers are 
temporarily in the ascendant over the 'hawks'.  We 
therefore have a choice before us which I am about to 
discuss with Chief Secretary and about which I will
then want to minute you.  Legal costs of going on m ay 
be £20m or so.  Political costs are high.  On the 
other hand, precedents are dangerous.  The purpose of 
this note is not to ask for a decision (since I hav e 
not yet had my meeting with HMT and the costs and  
92 benefits of either course are therefore not yet 
agreed) but to warn you that the last occasion when
a decision other than to fight it out could be take n,
is going to occur in the next few days.  Meanwhile,
obviously, we must play a dead bat." 
And so obviously I can ask Lord Waldegrave, as 
he now is, about that when he gives evidence next 
week.  But that's the minute he sent to you on 
5 December, not asking for any particular action or
decision on your part yet.  Is it likely, given it is 
directly from a minister to you, that you would hav e 
seen that?

--Result #292--
 And then just one final document on this issue of h ow 
the announcement was made. 
HMTR0000002_023. 
This is a minute from Strachan Heppell in the 
Department of Health to Mr Edwards in the Treasury.
It's 12 December 1990.  If we just look at text bef ore 
we look at the handwriting, it says: 
"I attach a copy of the press release which the 
plaintiffs' Steering Committee put out yesterday 
afternoon.
"You will see from this that while the Steering 
Committee comment that the figures do not represent
proper compensation in moral terms, they do make it
plain that these are figures that they would be 
prepared to recommend to their clients." 
I don't think I need to read the rest of it. 
If we can just go and look at the handwriting,                                   
 
                             13 I don't think -- if we just look at those who are 
copied first of all, is there anyone here who 
represents Number 10, as far as you can recall?

--Result #293--
 -- shortly before you became Prime Minister 
Mrs Thatcher wrote a letter to Alf Morris, 
2 November 1990.
HSOC0012332. 
So it's in response to a letter from Mr Morris,
enclosing a letter from the general secretary of 
The Haemophilia Society. 
If we just skate down the page, first of all, we 
can see the second paragraph, she says that she is 
appalled by the tragedy, as moved as everyone else by 
the plight of those infected.  
116 The next paragraph says: 
"... never disputed our moral responsibility to 
pay attention to the needs of the victims and their
families.""Disputed our moral responsibility to pay
attention to the needs of the victims and their 
families." 
Then the last paragraph on that page says:And 
then the last paragraph on that page says: 
"Despite our promise to keep under review the 
£34 million already made available, many haemophili acs 
have decided to pursue legal proceedings alleging 
negligence against the ... Government, the licensin g 
authorities [et cetera] ... The case is before the 
Courts.""Despite our promise to keep under review t he 
34 million already made available many haemophiliac s 
have decided to pursue legal proceedings alleging 
negligence against Government Licensing Authorities , 
et cetera, the case is before the courts." 
Over the page, Mrs Thatcher sets out the 
successive Government policy in relation to no-faul t 
compensation.  I don't propose to read out that lon g 
passage. 
Then in the last paragraph, she says: 
"I am sorry if this is a disappointing reply but 
the Government is showing its great concern for                                   
 
                             17 haemophiliacs with HIV, by the ex gratia payments i t 
is making.  The question of compensation has to rem ain 
a matter for the Courts to decide." 
So that's Mrs Thatcher's position not long 
before you take over as the Prime Minister.  And, a s 
we've seen, one of your first steps as Prime Minist er 
was to agree to what Mr Waldegrave was putting forw ard 
to you as a compromise of the HIV litigation. 
To what extent was the change in Government, and 
Mrs Thatcher being replaced by you, a factor in the
settlement of the case?

--Result #294--
 Then can I just finally ask you about one comment y ou 
make in your autobiography on this issue.  
So if we go back to RLIT0001628, please, and we 
go to page 7 of the document. 
The bottom of the page, you say this: 
"Another priority ..." 
So this the last paragraph, Sir John:
"... less specific perhaps, was tolerance;
a Conservative value which some Tories overlooked, and 
which I aimed to restore to the fold.  Two swift ac ts 
set the course: I decided to unfreeze Child Benefit
payments (this was achieved, at my request, in 
Norman Lamont's first budget), and to compensate 
haemophiliacs who had been infected with the HIV vi rus 
as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.  Bo th 
of these decisions achieved a certain notoriety, an d 
were seen by some as signs that I was breaking with
what had gone before.  This was a characteristicall y  
119 false history.  The broad tradition of our party wa s 
tolerant." 
Then you say this: 
"If a certain shrill and censorious tone had set 
in, it was that tone which broke faith with our pas t. 
My predecessor was not personally unsympathetic, bu t 
some, less tolerant than she, saw 'Thatcherism' as 
a vehicle for intolerance and, sometimes, prejudice ." 
Now, I'm going to ask you about what you say is 
the role of tolerance within the Conservative Party , 
Sir John.  It's the reference to, in the context of
discussing this very issue in your autobiography th e 
compensation for haemophiliacs infected with HIV, t o 
a "shrill and censorious tone" and some who saw 
Thatcherism as "a vehicle for intolerance and,
sometimes, prejudice".  Who and what did you have i n 
mind there?
Every political party is a coalition.  It 
doesn't matter, any political party of any size is 
a coalition and that is true of the Conservative Pa rty 
as well.  And there are some people in the 
Conservative Party who take what you might kindly c all 
a very hawkish view of social issues: the "everyone
must stand on their own two feet" argument, rather 
than an argument that understands that there is  
120 a responsibility for those who can to help those wh o 
cannot.  I was referring to the minority who took t he 
"stand on your own two feet" argument to extremes. 
Self-evidently in our society, there are a lot 
of people at any time, not least now, who need help
from those who are in a position to give it, and th e 
mainstream of the party I joined was always in favo ur 
of doing that.  I was very much in favour of doing 
that.  It wasn't a universal view inside the 
Conservative, then as now, and it was to that that 
I was referring.

--Result #295--
 But in any event, as I understand your earlier 
evidence, on this particular issue, compensation fo r 
haemophiliacs, you didn't have any particular 
discussions with Mrs Thatcher?

--Result #296--
 We can pick it up in April 1991 at DHSC0002872_001.
DHSC0002872_011, I'm sorry I think I said 0 -- 
my apologies, Lawrence, yes, 011. 
So this is a briefing for Number 10, 
24 April 1991, and we can see it's headed "HIV 
infected blood transfusion recipients" as distinct 
from haemophiliacs, and then we can see there are f ive 
short paragraphs to the briefing, the first is: 
"In general the Government does not accept the 
case for no-fault compensation for medical accident s. 
However, it recognised that special circumstances 
applied to the haemophiliacs with HIV." 
The next paragraph refers to what was said to be 
the double disadvantage for haemophiliacs because o f 
pre-existing haemophilia.  The third paragraph deal s 
with the hereditary nature of haemophilia and the 
implications of that. 
Then the fourth and fifth say this: 
"A similar combination of factors would not 
generally apply to blood transfusion cases. 
"In principle blood transfusion cases are no 
different from other people who suffered from medic al 
accidents or the unintended side effects of  
124 treatment." 
So that was the Government line, if I can put it 
that way, as at 1991.  I'm just going to show you o ne 
other document and then ask you about that line.  I f 
we go to DHSC0002912_009.  This is now the end of 
1991, 2 December 1991, and it's a letter from you t o 
John Marshall MP, and we can see that over the page , 
we can see John Marshall is at the bottom of the pa ge, 
he'd written to you raising this issue with you, as  he 
did, I think, on a number of occasions over the yea rs. 
So your response, if we go back to the previous 
page, if we look in the second and third paragraphs , 
you say: 
"We made clear when we made the settlement in 
the case of haemophiliacs that they were a very 
special case.  The Government has acted accordingly .
I have every sympathy with the plight of those 
non-haemophiliacs who have been infected with HIV a s 
a result of blood transfusions.  But, as you know, the 
House has very recently decided, on a free vote, th at 
it did not support the principle of no-fault 
compensation for medical accidents. 
"Every case of a patient damaged by medical 
treatment represents a human tragedy, but the cogen t 
arguments which led the House to reject the princip le                                   
 
                             25 of no-fault compensation apply, I believe, also in 
this case." 
So you were, as I read this letter, Sir John, is 
this right, effectively holding the Government line , 
maintaining the Government line?

--Result #297--
 If we go over the page, this is Mr Kinnock, as he t hen 
was, in a letter to you: 
"Dear Prime Minister, you will know of the most  
128 recent exchanges in the House on the subject of 
compensation for non-haemophiliacs who have 
accidentally been infected with HIV during blood 
transfusion or tissue transplants. 
"Like many other Members of Parliament and of 
the general public, I had expected that the Governm ent 
would by now have provided compensation for these 
tragic victims of accident.  I was surprised and 
dismayed, therefore, to see that Virginia Bottomley
has said that the Government would not make provisi on 
for the non-haemophiliacs on the same basis as the 
HIV-infected haemophiliacs, even though it is obvio us 
that both groups were victims of similar and seriou s 
treatment errors. 
"Making provision for the non-haemophiliacs 
would be elementary justice.  Far from involving 
'untold expenditure' as Mrs Bottomley claimed, it 
would involve a relatively modest sum and be 
completely justifiable as a way of at least easing the 
economic disadvantage suffered by the people afflic ted 
by HIV. 
"I must appeal to you that except on moral and 
logical grounds there should be compensation for th ese 
unfortunate people and ask you to take immediate 
action to see that it is paid."                                   
 
                             29 I think, top of the page, there is some 
handwriting, which I don't think we can clearly 
discern what that is, but was that your handwriting ?

--Result #298--
 Now, you had a meeting on 4 February with Mr Marsha ll 
and others.  We can look at it briefly for the sake  of 
completeness, it's CABO0000044_023.  So this is, 
again, from Mr Chapman, it's addressed to the 
Department of Health, and it refers to the meeting 
that took place the day before with a group of MPs who 
are there named and who include Mr Marshall. 
It records a number of points made by the 
delegation, I'm not going to go through the detail of 
those.
Bottom of the page, this records your response: 
"The Prime Minister expressed his personal 
sympathy for those affected.  He had to be concerne d,
however, that the case could set a precedent and he lp 
to lead to no-fault compensation.  Given the state of 
the art of blood screening at the time, it was                                   
 
                             33 difficult to say conclusively that the NHS was at 
fault.  It would be helpful if a clear, robust 
position on ring-fencing could be established.  If 
compensation were agreed, recipients would need to 
undertake, as the haemophiliacs have done, that the y 
would not pursue extra compensation through the 
courts." 
Then, over the page: 
"The Prime Minister agreed to consider the 
matter further and to discuss it with your 
Secretary of State and the Chief Secretary." 
So is it right to understand this letter as 
essentially saying that you were not opposed to the
provision of financial assistance, provided it didn 't 
set a precedent for other cases?

--Result #299--
 If we start with DHSC0004498_143.  So this is 
a Number 10 letter to the Department of Health, 
November 1995.  It says here, under the heading 
"Haemophilia and Hepatitis C": 
"You will recall that we discussed the 
possibility of the Prime Minister meeting a delegat ion 
of Conservative MPs, led by John Marshall, to discu ss 
the case for compensation for haemophiliacs who hav e 
contracted the Hepatitis C virus. 
"The Prime Minister remains unconvinced that it 
would be sensible for him to meet the delegation.
However, in light of the recent concern expressed b y 
a large number of MPs, the Prime Minister would lik e 
to consider the case for a meeting more carefully.  To 
assist him, I should be grateful for a short briefi ng 
on the issue, to include a summary of the line he 
might take in such a meeting." 
Now, we'll look at a handful of documents in 
a moment, Sir John, about decision-making, but this
might suggest that essentially you, Number 10, was 
really being led by the Department of Health, or th e 
Department of Health was leading on this issue, and
setting the policy; is that right?

--Result #300--
 I think in terms of hepatitis C, there were two 
reasons.  Inevitably, in everything any Government 
does, there is a fiscal view, either it is easily 
granted or it isn't.  And, in the financial positio n 
of the 1990s, very little was easily granted.  So o f 
course there would have been a fiscal element.
There is also the comparison between the 
position of haemophiliacs themselves and haemophili acs 
with HIV, and those with hepatitis C, which, as The
Haemophilia Society themselves conceded in letters,
was a far lesser risk and, as the medical advice we
received, and they received, confirmed that was the
case. 
So it would have probably been -- and I'm 
assuming what was in the Department of Health's min d 
because they didn't set it out in a note to me -- I 'm 
assuming it was a combination of those two things t hat 
they were referring to in terms of the innate 
resistance.                                   
 
                             41 They may also have been referring to a third 
thing, and that was the innate resistance in 
Parliament as a whole to the vote against no-fault 
compensation in a private members' bill that had be en 
taken some time before.

--Result #301--
 Well, I've no recollection of it but, of course, I' ve 
read the papers again and looked at it, so I'm 
familiar with the position that was taken then.  An d 
the position that I must have taken then, though if
you ask me whether I actually remember it, the answ er 
is that I don't. 
I think we were infected -- affected by the 
usual arguments that I have repeated again and agai n 
about no-fault compensation.  But beyond that we we re 
influenced, undoubtedly, by medical opinion advisin g 
us that hepatitis C sufferers were in a very differ ent 
position overall from those who previously had been 
143 granted compensation.  And I think the information we 
were given as to the number of deaths was -- every 
death is tragic but it was wholly different from th e 
information from the delegation of senior conservat ive 
MPs that you referred to a moment ago, and very, ve ry 
different. 
There were other factors, I think, at the time. 
The British Government wasn't the only Government i n 
refusing compensation to hepatitis C victims, 
presumably for the same reasons.  Almost every othe r 
country and maybe all of them, I can't be certain o f 
that, did not offer compensation to patients 
contracting hepatitis C, and I dare say that would 
have been a significant factor.  And, of course,
the information we had from the Haemophilia Society
itself, Graham Barker's letter to Arthur [redacted in 
statement] ** is a case in point.  If you have that  to 
hand, it illustrates the distinction between the tw o. 
So it would have been a combination of those 
things.  I don't know in retrospect whether that wa s 
the right decision, it's impossible to know.  You t ake 
the decisions with the focus of immediate events, y ou 
look at them later a good deal in retrospect, and y ou 
wonder on a number of fronts: was I wrong, perhaps by 
being too under-generous?  Was I wrong with being t oo  
144 overgenerous?  
I've never been entirely certain with 
hepatitis C whether we took the right decision then , 
but that was the one that we took.  Suffice to say,  if 
I remember rightly, ten years later I think 
hepatitis C patients were granted some compensation . 
I don't know how much -- 

--Result #302--
 Well, if the Government considered everything it di d 
in a public inquiry it would be rather a heavy burd en 
to undertake for everyone.                                   
 
                             65 I think the way they normally come about is when 
the Prime Minister of the day is approached and 
requested either by the people who seek it or by 
people lobbying on their behalf, and a case is made  to 
him or her that there should be a public inquiry.  No 
such case was made to me.  To the best of my 
recollection it was not mentioned to me at any stag e. 
And since most of the time I was Prime Minister we 
were actually in the business of dealing with the 
problem of haemophiliacs and providing compensation , 
or HIV sufferers and providing compensation, and bl ood 
and tissue sufferers and providing compensation, th e 
issue itself didn't arise.  And it certainly didn't
arise, nor was I at that time aware that other 
countries had public inquiries, and none of those 
public inquiries reported during the time I was in 
Government.  So it really was, because we were 
actively involved in it for most of the time, simpl y 
not an issue that arose.  Nobody mentioned it to me
within the Department of Health who might have done , 
or from the Treasury who might have done, or from t he 
Haemophilia Society, who were more likely to have d one 
it.  So I was never called upon to consider the iss ue. 
And since I considered it most of the time until 
the very end of my time in Government, over the  
166 last 18 months or so, I didn't consider it myself 
without a request to do so.  I had no request to do
so, and so I didn't consider it.  I thought we were
actively dealing with the matter, and it was only 
later, in retrospect, in fact very many years later , 
that the decision -- 20 years after I left office i n 
fact -- before it was decided that there should be 
a public inquiry.

--Result #303--
 Well, I think a new precedent has been established now 
of ex gratia payments, so I don't think you can get
away from the danger of no-fault compensation, but 
there has now been a way to go around it, and deal 
with cases where there is a special requirement 
because of an event that may not have been the dire ct 
fault of a government or government's servants in a ny 
capacity, but where compensation is merited.  And 
I think the ex gratia payment proposal that was 
developed will meet that in future.

--Result #304--
 Well, there are two aspects of that.  The first one  is 
the social security payments, which plainly stand o n 
their own, quite apart from -- I think "compensatio n" 
179 is the wrong word, actually.  "Ex gratia payments"
would be a more accurate way.  It isn't compensatio n. 
Compensation in terms of -- you cannot 
compensate, there is no way you can compensate for 
what happened to the victims of the blood tragedy, you 
cannot compensate them, it wouldn't matter whatever
you did for them or paid them, there is no 
compensation for the way their lives were wrecked, 
let's be entirely clear about that.  So I think 
"compensation" isn't the right term. 
An ex gratia payment is probably a more accurate 
way, but I'm not sure that there is a word that you
couldn't take offence to if you wished to.  So -- b ut 
it certainly isn't compensation, which these days h as 
also come to be used as a narrative for salary as 
well: your compensation for doing your job is £X
a year.  So certainly we should get away from the u se 
of the word "compensation" because it doesn't and i t 
can't.

--Result #305--
 Well, it didn't.  I mean, the things that were in 
train at the time of the election were the Maastric ht 
Agreement, which had been wildly well received when
first made and subsequently came under huge critici sm,
particularly from within the Conservative Party.  T hat 
produced a divided party and was a significant issu e. 
Then there was the question of rising inflation, 
falling house prices and the other economic problem s 
that arose from events in the '80s, but carried the
recession right into the early years of the '90s. 
Those were the mega-issues of the campaign.  And I can 
honestly say that the decision on compensation -- o n 
a payment at that stage was not affected by the 
forthcoming general election and did not affect the
election in any material way. 

--Result #306--
   But it brings me really to just two 
aspects of what you've said, that were perhaps 
intriguing.  You were asked earlier this morning ab out 
something that John Moore said, and you said this, 
that John Moore had said, at one stage, that there was 
not a good case for compensation for reasons of 
precedent.  He did not rule out, nor did he say he' d 
ruled out, compensation in view of the circumstance s 
of those who were infected.  Can I just look with y ou 
for a moment at the question of precedent and how i t 
interacts with special circumstances? 
Precedent, I suppose, involves two things.  One 
may be looking back to the past and seeing if it's 
been done before or not been done before, so there is 
a precedent, either for doing it or not doing it.  It 
may also be a fear for establishing, by doing it fo r 
the first time, as you may think, that it may happe n  
191 again and there may be a call for it to happen agai n,
and so you may be establishing a precedent for the 
future.  Those two sides. 
But in either case, however one views precedent, 
it only applies, doesn't it, if the facts in each c ase 
are sufficiently similar, or the principle which 
underlies them, to apply to both cases?

--Result #307--
 Well, it was the principle that was concerning the 
Government, the principle that unless there had bee n 
shown to be a legal requirement to pay, because of 
misbehaviour in some form by the Government agency,
then there had been no occasion when there had been
compensation.  The reference to no-fault compensati on 
was based on the principle that that had never 
happened before, governments collectively, of all 
parties, as far back as one could trace, had never 
agreed in the principle of no-fault compensation. 
If the Government had made a failure, either 
they agreed compensation or it went to court and th ey 
were forced to pay compensation.  But to pay 
compensation without having found to be at fault, a nd 
without having gone to court, had not happened befo re, 
and it was that principle which we loosely called 
no-fault compensation.  That was an inherent part o f 
the instincts of the Treasury in particular, but al so  
192 across Government.

--Result #308--
 No, it doesn't, if you can identify those 
circumstances.  But, at the time, there was no 
scientific knowledge that what was being done in th e 
'70s, which was plainly wrong and caused terrible 
tragedies, that it was not known to anybody that th ere 
nothing anyone could have done that would have 
prevented it in the light of what was known by scie nce 
and medicine at that time. 
Now, that's not the case in Aberfan, plainly 
they shouldn't have banked up everything that fell 
down on Aberfan in the 1960s, and so on.  So you co uld 
find a fault and something that could and should ha ve 
been prevented.                                   
 
                             93 With the lack of knowledge, when someone was 
doing something for which there was no knowledge th at 
it went wrong, it was done for the best of motives,
but it was wrong, then nobody could have foreseen 
that, nobody was derelict in their responsibilities . 
And that really is the point that underlies the 
no-fault compensation argument.

--Result #309--
 Well, I think if you can make an exceptional case a nd 
plainly in this case you can, if you seek -- if you
cite a legal obligation that's a very unwise thing to 
do because how can you determine it, the courts may
consider differently.  Indeed, the advice the 
Government got repeatedly, right through the 
compensation packages we produced, was that if we w ent 
to court, if we were taken to court, the balance of
probabilities is that the Government would win the 
case, and that was repeatedly the advice. 
That being so, you are using public money                                   
 
                             97 without a legal justification, so if you cannot hav e 
a legal justification, what is your justification f or 
spending the taxpayers' money and there has to be o ne. 
I would call it a moral obligation; other people ma y 
call it something different.  But I think we have t o 
recognise that those circumstances will occur, and in 
a civilised society, the majority have an obligatio n 
to a minority, if that minority falls on particular ly 
hard times. 
The same principle applies, of course, with 
social security payments.  There is no legal 
obligation to pay a social security payment to some one 
who is unemployed, but there is an obligation in th e 
civilised society to do so.  You can equate that as
a first cousin, perhaps, I might say, to what has 
happened with the ex gratia payments in this 
particular case.

--Result #310--
 Then could we turn, then leaving aside now, leaving
behind the HIV Haemophilia Litigation, can we turn to 
some views you expressed about compensation for blo od 
transfusion and organ recipients.  I think there's 
more than one document but I think we only need loo k 
at one for the purposes of the discussion. 

--Result #311--
 But then, essentially, fell by the wayside or there
was no decision to go with such a scheme until it t hen 
came up again, following the conclusion or around t he 
time of the conclusion of the HIV Haemophilia 
Litigation and eventually a scheme was set up in 19 92. 
So I'm hoping it you may be able to help us in 
understanding why the issue or the idea wasn't take n 
any further in 1988. 
You set out your views here, and there are views 
to, I think, perhaps a similar effect from Mr Heppe ll,  
115 and I'll just give the reference to that, for the 
benefit of the transcript, I'm not going to go to i t,
and it's DHSC0003960_005. 
Your views here, if we pick it up, fifth line,
the first paragraph: 
"The purpose of this minute is to explain my 
concerns to CMO as I am sure Ministers will want to
discuss this is with him.  I have discussed the 
problem briefly with Dr Harris and he suggested 
I should write this way." 
Then, first of all, in paragraph 2, you say: 
"There are logical inconsistencies  in any 
extension of the scheme.  Ministers took care when the 
haemophiliacs scheme was announced to say this was not 
compensation for damage caused by NHS treatment, bu t 
a recognition of the special hardship of haemophili a 
which were compounded by HIV infection.  Many other
HIV patients have the same expenses as transfusion 
recipients.  Yet restricting eligibility to those 
infected by blood received in the UK ... looks very
much like compensation for damage caused -- raising
the issues of compensation for other blood-acquired
infections (like the much commoner hepatitis) or 
complications more generally.  Any restrictions to 
AIDS cases  only, whilst avoiding some of the problems  
116 of identifying those who might be eligible, would b e 
inconsistent with the response to haemophiliacs and
ignores the significant non-AIDS HIV morbidity and 
mortality.  Experience with infected haemophiliacs 
suggests ex gratia payments of this sort do not app ear 
to lessen the chance of litigation.  It is reasonab le 
also to ask who is next?   Why should infected health 
care workers be excluded, the babies of infected 
mothers, the faithful wives of bisexuals and all th e 
other 'innocent victims'." 
Then over the page you set out your view that 
you believed: 
"... an extended scheme would be damaging to the 
transfusion service  as well as having serious 
practical problems."
I want to go through each of these and just ask 
you a little more about them.  You say, first of al l: 
"Confidence in the safety of the blood supply 
would be undermined.  Patients would be reminded th at 
even now blood supply is not free of infection." 
Why did you think that providing financial 
support to those who had been infected would underm ine 
confidence in the safety of the blood supply, given
you could now say, "Well, we've got testing for 
HTLV-III"?                                   
 
                             17 
--Result #312--
 Then you set out your belief that: 
"... a general HIV compensation scheme would be 
totally opposed by the transfusion service.  They h ave 
enough difficulties already. 
"When in the AIDS Unit I argued against any move 
that might be taken as treating 'innocent victims'
differently from the rest." 
Then you refer in paragraph 6 to those arguments 
being sufficient to persuade H(A) -- who is H(A)?

--Result #313--
 "... to restrict compensation to haemophiliacs when 
120 this was discussed last year." 
Now, it's clear from this that you were firmly 
opposed to the idea of providing financial support to 
those infected thorough transfusion. 

--Result #314--
   Mr Watters, yesterday we'd looked at an 
internal DHSS minute of 16 November 1989 which 
referred to an earlier minute from Mr Heppell of 
10 November 1989.  We've located that overnight, th e 
10 November memo, and I know that you've seen it no w.  
2We'll put that up on the screen. 
Soumik, it's DHSC0004415_155. 
We can see there -- if we zoom in on the top 
half of the page, we can see it's a memo from 
Strachan Heppell dated 10 November 1989, and then i f 
we go down a little we can see under the heading 
"Haemophiliacs with AIDS/HIV": 
"MS(H) [that's the minister of state for 
health] will want to have a brief account of my 
meeting with [Reverend] Tanner and Mr Watters of Th e 
Haemophilia Society and also Mr Chisholm of GJW 
Government Relations ... we shall be preparing 
a fuller agreed note of their views but this sets o ut 
their main concerns.  The note below also takes 
account of further information from Mr Watters this
morning." 
Then we can see under the heading "The 
Society's position", it says: 
"The Society is interested in promoting an out 
of Court settlement as the Court action is likely t o 
drag on over a number of years and any compensation
awarded would come too late for many of their membe rs. 
"3.  The Society would commend a settlement to 
its members but only if the amount were sufficient to 
win the support of the plaintiffs solicitors.  The  
3Society has been criticised by some for accepting a n 
inadequate GBP 10 million for the Macfarlane Trust and 
they do not want to be put in the same position aga in. 
Their aim is to obtain compensation but they would be 
happy not to call it that as they recognise the 
difficulties for Government in making any payment 
which implied acceptance of any liability on its pa rt, 
on the part of the NHS or on the part of Committee of 
Safety on Medicines." 
Then if we go over the page, we pick it up in 
paragraph 5, the second paragraph on page: 
"The plaintiffs have seen press reports of 
payments in other countries, usually the generous e nd 
of the scale, and this has raised expectations.  Th e 
Society's present view, having consulted lawyers, i s 
that a sum of GBP 120 million - on average around 
GBP 100,000 a case - would be required to bring leg al 
action to an end." 
Then -- 

--Result #315--
 Thank you. 
I'm going to move now to ask you to look at 
a handful of documents relating to the possibility of 
campaigning for compensation in relation to 
hepatitis C, Mr Watters.  So we're moving to 1990 n ow. 
If we could have up on screen, please, 
HSOC0010409, please.  We can see this is a meeting of 
the Executive Committee on 11 January 1990.  It 
doesn't appear as though you were there, Mr Watters , 
but there is a reference to your report and that's 
what I want to take you to.  So if we go to the bot tom 
of page 3, please, of this document, we can see in the 
last paragraph it refers to a report from the Gener al 
Secretary, which was your title by this time, which
had been circulated in advance and the point I just
wanted to ask you about that was this: 
"Hepatitis: It was agreed that the General 
Secretary should look into the position of a number  of 
people who, while free of HIV infection, had suffer ed 
severe liver damage and the prospect of compensatio n  
16 associated with that condition." 
So would it be right to understand this as the 
point in time at which the Society effectively firs t 
turned its attention to considering exploring 
compensation for non-HIV-infected patients infected
with hepatitis C? 

--Result #316--
 Then if we go to HSOC0024271, please.  So this is 
a report at the beginning of the following month,
2 February 1990, "General Secretary's Report to The
Executive Committee", and if we go to page 6, pleas e, 
if we look at paragraph 28, which is in the bottom 
half of the page, under the heading "Hepatitis", yo u 
have said this: 
"Following the last meeting I wrote to Dr Rizza 
about the hep problem and the possibilities of                                     
 
                      7 compensation, et cetera.  Dr Rizza needs time to 
consider his position on this in view of the curren t 
litigation and will discuss the situation with 
Regional Directors and their lawyers.  In the meant ime 
we could possibly put a short piece in UPDATE seeki ng 
those who have been caused severe liver damage as 
a result of their use of blood products?" 
Mr Watters, the question I have for you is 
this: having decided to look at the possibility of 
compensation for haemophiliacs infected with 
hepatitis C, why write to Dr Rizza, involved in 
litigation for the authorities already being sued, why 
was it thought that someone already involved in 
litigation, who might have a position to defend, wo uld 
be the right person to ask for advice? 

--Result #317--
 
"At the present time it was agreed that we were 
neither for or against pursuing compensation for 
people infected with hepatitis C as a result of 
treatment with blood products.  We have neither the
resources to tackle the issue nor the co-operation of 
Centre Directors." 
In terms of resources to tackle the issue, what 
was the difficulty there in terms of the Society's own 
resources? 

--Result #318--
 Then the second part of that sentence says:  
19 "... [we don't have] the co-operation of Centre 
Directors." 
Again, why would you expect or need the 
co-operation of centre directors in order to pursue
the question of compensation for patients? 

--Result #319--
 I'm going to ask you next about an observation you 
make in your statement, Mr Watters.  It's WITN34290 01. 
If we go to page 73, please, we pick it up at the 
bottom of that page in paragraph 163, you say this:
"I believe that the call for compensation for 
people with haemophilia who were infected with 
Hepatitis were starting at the time of my departure
from The [and we go over the page] Society.  From 
recollection, the Executive Committee had to be ver y 
careful that it did not portray people with 
haemophilia as people were always asking for more.  As 
a result" -- 

--Result #320--
 One of the recommendations of the Scottish report, the 
Ross report, had been for there to be payments made
effectively beyond a certain -- or to some categori es 
of patients on a full compensation basis.  Can you 
recall whether there were any discussions about 
whether a compensation principle should or should n ot 
form part of the Skipton Fund approach? 

--Result #321--
 If we look at the bottom half of the page, it's thr ee 
indented paragraphs up from the bottom, where it 
begins:
"- there would be no payments to bereaved 
families, or to those who have cleared the virus 
naturally.  The first of these, in particular, is 
regarded as unacceptable by The Haemophilia Society
and its political allies, so there may be campaigni ng 
on it.  This could put certain MFT Trustees in 
a difficult position.  For my part (as 
a Society-appointed Trustee) I can live with the NH S 
making ex gratia payments, with no admission of 
liability, to people it has harmed who are still al ive 
and are or will be incurring costs as a result of 
their infection, while ignoring what would seem a b it 
more like compensation who have been bereaved (even  in                                     
 
                      1 those cases where such bereavement has resulted in 
real financial hardship)." 
What was your understanding of the rationale 
for the Department's resistance to assisting the 
bereaved? 

--Result #322--
 In your dealings with the Department of Health ther e,
at that stage and in relation to any of the schemes ,
trusts, funds, companies we've discussed, was the 
establishment of a no fault compensation scheme eve r 
raised? 

--Result #323--
 Then we see you setting out here, under the heading
"Underlying principles", the following: 
"2.1  That financial support from the Trust is 
NOT compensation as such, but is intended to help                                     
 
                                |  21 compensate for some of the results of infection, th ese 
results varying between individuals." 
Then this: 
"2.2  That support is primarily for 
registrants." 
Now, by "registrants" did you mean those who 
had been infected? 

--Result #324--
 Yes.  I'm really pleased, actually, the Inquiry ask ed 
this question because no-one ever asked me before a nd  
195 I think tackling the need for people to claim means
tested benefits is a priority but the solution,
actually, does not lie in just increasing -- call i t 
what you like -- support payments or compensation 
payments, because if those are disregarded, ignored  as 
capital, land or income, for means-tested benefits 
people are still caught in the means-tested benefit
trap.  What means-tested benefits do is that they 
inhibit people's ability to do things like just get
a job -- I mean, I dealt with a case three weeks ag o 
where a guy has -- sadly, his ordinary capital has 
drifted just slightly above the £6,000 lower limit,  he 
has to tell the DWP.  That will all be reassessed,
paperwork back and forth.  It inhibits people getti ng 
a relationship.  There's lots of research evidence 
that's done by groups like Child Poverty Action Gro up 
about the way particularly women either get forced 
into a premature relationship because of the 
means-tested benefit rules or they don't develop th e 
relationship that, you know, in a way one would exp ect 
it to develop, in the normal course of events. 
So I think if we can get people off 
means-tested benefits that is really the way forwar d. 
So the solution I have suggested is to make the 
support payments or compensation payments, call the m  
196 what you like, analogous to an occupational pension .
If it could be administered by, perhaps, an NHS bod y 
I realise the NHS Business Services Authority 
administer the NHS Pension Scheme, and the corollar y 
would be that those payments then count as income 
against means-tested benefit, but if you increase t he 
payments, then the cost of that can partly be 
(unclear)  by a transfer of the means-tested benefits 
paid to people, you can then devise a system that 
lists people above means-tested benefit level, so y ou 
know they leave the means-tested nonsense and 
intrusion behind. 
It also means if it's through one of the NHS 
pension schemes, for example -- if someone, as 
happened again quite recently, someone wants to -- 
they need to rent a new property and they've got to
explain to the letting agent what's EIBSS, the 
infected blood support scheme, you know.  It's not 
a conversation you want to have with your landlord or 
a letting agent, or if they apply for credit or wan t 
to get a mortgage or whatever it is. 
So, you know, the proposal I put forward in my 
witness statement -- I mean, I commend it to you --  it 
needs further work, but there's a lot of expertise.
There are economists and many others within the DWP                                    
 
                                |  197 and the Department for Health and Social Care to tr y 
to devise a scheme that is non-means tested, that 
lifts people above means tested benefit level. 
As regards repeated assessments for ESA and 
PIP, I don't think there's an easy answer, given th e 
direction of Government policy and their firm stanc e 
on doing that and their distrust of benefit claiman ts 
and almost the hostile environment that's been crea ted 
towards benefit claimants over the years. 
But certainly more rigorous application of the 
ten-year rule for PIP and also the severe condition s 
guidance for ESA would be a tremendous assistance t o 
this group and, indeed, actually for lots of other 
people. 

--Result #325--
   Well, I can start because I have hard copies 
of the document.  I will just have to look at the 
large screen to check it's the correct one.  So thi s 
was the announcement in relation to England by the 
then Health Secretary, John Reid, 29th August 2003 -- 
it is now working -- we can see in the second 
paragraph it says: 
"Mr Reid said: 'After becoming Secretary of 
State, I looked at the history of this issue and 
decided on compassionate grounds this is the right 
thing to do in this situation.'
"'I have therefore decided in principle that 
English hepatitis C sufferers should receive ex-gra tia 
payments from the Department of Health.'" 
6Sir, you will see there, sir, the phrase 
"ex gratia  payments" which we are familiar with from 
the evidence we have heard so far from the other 
Trusts and schemes and the reference to this said t o 
be a decision based upon compassionate grounds.
The press release records that the details of 
the payments have yet to be worked out.
This was clearly, as we can see, 
an announcement in relation to England on 
29th August 2003.  Similar announcements were made in 
relation to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by
the respective administrations.  I will look in 
a minute at how the scheme came to be a UK-wide sch eme 
ultimately administered by the Department of Health  in 
London when we look at the agency agreement. 
The Skipton Fund, as it became called, was 
incorporated on 25th March 2004 as a private compan y 
limited by guarantee without share capital.  So tha t's 
its legal form and status.  Its incorporation and t he 
press release that we have seen followed the 
conclusion of litigation in the High Court and the 
judgment of Mr Justice Burton in 2001 in A v Nation al 
Blood Authority, but it also followed upon the 
publication of a report commissioned by the Scottis h 
Executive in 2003, usually known as the Ross Report .  
7We will just look at that.  It is HSOC0020367.
You will see it is the Report of the Expert 
Group of Financial and Other Support March 2003 and  we 
can see it was commissioned by the Scottish Executi ve.
If we go to what I think will be page 13 
electronically, we can see the recommendations in 
relation to financial payments.  There were a numbe r 
of other recommendations which I am not going to go
through at this stage but recommendation 1 was that : 
"The Scottish Executive should agree to make 
compensation payments ..." 
Sir, you will note there the word 
"compensation" rather than " ex gratia ": 
"... as a matter of urgency to all people who 
can demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, t hat 
they received blood, blood products or tissue from the 
NHS in Scotland before the dates when they were mad e 
HCV-safe and who were subsequently found to be 
infected with Hepatitis C virus ..."
Then we can see the specific recommendations: 
"... an initial lump sum of £10,000 to cover 
inevitable anxiety, stress and social disadvantage 
..."  
So that would have encompassed all who were 
infected with hepatitis C, including what we will s ee  
8is referred to as natural clearers who were ultimat ely 
excluded from the Skipton Fund scheme.  Then: 
"an additional lump sum of £40,000 to those who 
develop chronic Hepatitis C to cover pain and 
suffering ..."
So all those who moved from the acute stage to 
develop chronic hepatitis C would receive 
an additional £40,000 and then at 
--Result #326--
 
"... those who subsequently suffer serious 
deterioration in physical condition because of thei r 
Hepatitis C infection eg cirrhosis, liver cancer or
other similar serious condition(s), should be entit led 
to full compensation.  This compensation should be 
calculated on the same basis as common law damages 
taking account of the payments made under A and B 
above." 
So the recommendation there, you will see, for 
those who -- ultimately, a similar cohort to whose who 
became eligible for stage 2 payments under the Skip ton 
Fund when established, the Ross Committee's 
recommendation was full compensation on a Common La w 
damages basis.  Then if we look at D we see provisi on 
there in the recommendations where those who had di ed, 
the above payment should still be made but made to 
their executors.                                   
 
                      Then if we look just at the bottom of the page 
at 
--Result #327--
 
"people who become infected with Hepatitis C as 
a result of the virus being transmitted from a pers on 
infected by blood, blood products or tissue from th e 
NHS in Scotland shall be entitled to compensation o n 
a similar basis to those who have been infected 
directly in this manner." 
So effectively partners, spouses, would be 
treated in exactly the same way as those who were 
infected directly through receipt of the blood or 
blood products. 
Those were the primary recommendations of the 
Ross Report in terms of the quantification of the 
compensation which was recommended.

--Result #328--
   They were not assessed on  
10 a compensation basis.

--Result #329--
   They were not and obviously nothing for 
natural clearers who were effectively excluded from
the scheme once it was up and running.  Then we wil l 
look at the quantification of the payments for thos e 
at stage 1 and stage 2, but very much less than the
sums contemplated here and not on a compensation ba sis 
at all. 
Clearly, the extent to which the 
recommendations of the Ross Report were considered by 
Government decision makers and the reasons why thos e 
particular recommendations were not implemented wil l 
need to be explored with relevant Government and ci vil 
service witnesses in due course.
We do have some insight into some aspects of 
Government thinking, however, from a document at 
SCGV0000256_020. 
If we go to the next page, please, Soumik, if 
we carry on, this is an e-mail from Bob Stock, 
11th December 2020, so it's an internal Scottish 
Government document.  It provides some insight into
the thinking of the Scottish Government but also so me 
broader insight into the thinking behind the 
establishment of the Skipton Fund in place of the 
recommendations of the Ross Committee.  We can see  
11 it's entitled:
"'Hepatitis C from blood' ex gratia scheme ..." 
So already we have gone from compensation 
through John Reid's announcement in August 2003 of ex 
gratia, and we see ex gratia  is still the language 
used here:
"... Details of proposed parameters and 
administration.
"Purpose 
"To seek Ministers endorsement of the detailed 
parameters that will apply to the scheme and for th e 
proposals for administering it.
"Priority 
"Immediate.  Department of Health ... are 
proposing that there is a joint announcement by the
four UK Health Ministers on either 18 or 19 Decembe r 
and Mr Chisholm will wish to inform cabinet colleag ues 
before this." 
Then if you look under the heading 
"Discussion", paragraph numbered 1: 
"This minute outlines the proposals jointly 
agreed by the officials of the Scottish Executive, DH, 
Welsh Assembly government and Northern Ireland 
administration.  The basic parameters already 
announced in Scotland are retained (ie £20k basic  
12 award, £25k on reaching medical trigger, no payment s 
to those who clear the virus spontaneously or to 
dependants of those who died before 29 August) ..."
Those are the features that the Skipton Fund 
then provided: 
"... but are then augmented to cover detail on 
eligibility, supporting evidence and on how the sch eme 
would be administered." 
Although this is a Scottish Government 
document, it is said to reflect that which has been
agreed by the four respective Departments of Health .
If we go over a further two pages, please, 
Soumik, and we can see there "Proposed scheme 
parameters".  I am not going to go through it 
paragraph by paragraph but we will see broadly what
the Skipton Fund scheme was going to be and did 
become.  Under the heading "Eligibility date": 
"No payments will be made in respect of people 
who died before 29 August 2003." 
Then the next heading:
"Eligibility for Basic Award of £20,000."  
That's the stage 1 award, as it became known.
The "Criteria" are there set out: 
"Potential beneficiaries will receive the basic 
award of £20,000 if they have been infected with bl ood                                   
 
                      3 or blood products before September 1991." 
There we see the eligibility cut off date. 
Then if we go over to what I think will be page 8, we 
can see here the proposed arrangements for the 
administration of the fund.  Under the heading "Sin gle 
UK scheme": 
"It is proposed the four UK administrations 
operate essentially identical schemes with identica l 
awards and that the most efficient way of dealing w ith 
this is for payments on behalf of all four 
administrations to be handled as part of a single U K 
scheme -- administered by a single independent Trus t." 
In the next paragraph we learn why it is called 
Skipton Fund: 
"It has been suggested that this might be named 
Skipton Trust." 
It took the form ultimately of a limited 
company, not a charitable Trust: 
"The basis for this is that the substantive 
negotiations between officials of the four 
administrations took place in Skipton House, London ." 
Then we see reference to the Macfarlane Trust,
this is paragraph 3, having agreed to take on the t ask 
of setting up and administering the new trust.  You
will recall, sir, we have heard from Mr Peter Steve ns  
14 about his involvement in that.
"Financial arrangements 
"The four administrations would be billed by 
the Trust for awards paid out to beneficiaries 
attributable to the relevant country.  The logical 
method of attribution would be that the beneficiary
had been infected as a result of treatment in that 
country." 
Then there is an alternative, which would be 
that the beneficiary was currently resident in that
country.
5 tells us that: 
"Department of Health would take the lead in 
dealing with the new Trust.  The four administratio ns 
would contribute to the establishment and running 
costs of the Trust and possibly also to an initial 
working capital fund."
Then if we go to the next page, please, we see 
a heading "Key issues": 
"Sensitivities.
"The Haemophilia Society has been made aware of 
the likely scheme parameters and believes them to b e 
unacceptable.  This is principally because they fee l 
the awards are too low and because no payments are to 
be made to the dependants of those who died before  
15 29 August." 
Then there is a reference to the Haemophilia 
Society having recommended payments to dependants o f 
the deceased and also the reference to the expert 
report.  And it is recorded that Macfarlane and Eil een 
Trusts made such payments.

--Result #330--
   Just one final part of this document.  It is 
the next page, and it is the bottom of this page un der 
the heading "Variations and conditions".  We can se e 
it says: 
"People who have received compensation as 
a result of a successful legal action against the N HS 
(or an out-of-court settlement in relation to a leg al 
action) would have that deducted from the total awa rd.
"People who have received compensation as the 
result of a successful legal action against a produ ct 
supplier would have that deducted from the total  
19 award." 
Then this: 
"People who receive payments under the scheme 
would undertake not to institute future legal 
proceedings against the NHS or ministers in relatio n 
to the situation that formed the basis of those 
payments." 
Whether that is something that in practice was 
adopted is a matter I am hoping to explore with 
Mr Fish tomorrow.  But you have heard evidence, sir , 
from one individual who had a recollection in relat ion 
to the Skipton Fund of being asked to sign 
an undertaking, although it is right to say the 
Inquiry's investigations of the beneficiaries' file s 
have not found anything to suggest that that was th e 
practice.  But it is a matter we will want to take up 
with witnesses this week. 
So those are a couple of relevant documents 
which precede the establishment of the scheme. 
I want to turn next to the agency agreement 
that governed the way in which the scheme operated.
It is at SKIP0000033_066, please, Soumik.  Sir, we 
obviously heard a lot of evidence in relation to ot her 
financial schemes about the relationship between th e 
Trust or the body and the Department of Health. 
20 In relation to the Skipton Fund, the fund 
operated as an agent of the Department of Health, a nd 
this is the document that governed the relationship .
This is the first signed agency agreement.  There w ere 
then various variations and modifications made to t he 
scheme as the years went by, but you will note the 
date: 22 May 2007.  This is nearly three years afte r 
the Skipton Fund began to operate and received and 
began processing its first applications.  Quite why  it 
took three years for the agency agreement to be 
concluded is no doubt a matter we will want to ask 
relevant Department of Health witnesses in due cour se.
And, again, you will recall I asked Mr Stevens abou t 
that.
If we go to page 3, please, Soumik, we can see 
that the parties are the Department of Health and 
Skipton Fund Limited.  The background is set out at  
--Result #331--
   That would follow legally in a case 
in which there was a question of whether the condit ion 
for which compensation was being sought had been 
caused by what is generally a multi-factorial 
condition.

--Result #332--

  
And then
 
if we just
 -- 
following the
developments through chronologically
, 
if we 
go
 to
EIBS0000705
, 
we can see this 
a 
letter from Penny
Mordaunt
, 
Paymaster General
, 
to Chancellor of the
Exchequer Rishi Sunak
, 
21 September 2020
, 
and she
says
: 
"
I am writing to update 
on the ... Inquiry, as
promised in my letter of 
13 July, 
specifically our
commitments on financial support and compensation
."  
Then under the
 
heading 
"
Financial support
", 
she
 
72
refers to people receiv
ing
 ex gratia
 financial and
non-financial 
support and 
the Ministers 
and 
the
previous Prime Minister have committed to address
disparities across the UK in the levels of financial
support provided.  She then refers to figures
, 
so we
can see there 
£
32 million there for Scotland and then
the figures for the other three nations.
Reference is made to the chair's observation
about the 
grinding 
hardship experience
, 
and then
there's 
a 
request:
"I would be grateful 
for your views on how this
additional funding would be integrated best into the
2020 Comprehensive 
Spending Review."
Then if we look at the bottom of the page
, under
the heading
 "
Compensation for victims
", 
she says she
expects the Inquiry to make recommendations
: 
"... 
inevitable 
that 
the Government will need to
provide
 
substantial compensation.  The costs are
likely 
to
 
be
 high
, 
and I firmly believe that we should
begin preparing for 
this
 now -- 
before the Inquiry
reports."
Then over the page she request
s a 
meeting 
and
then 
says
: 
"
I cannot stress enough the urgency of taking
long 
overdue action on financial support and

                        3
compensation
."  
Then refers to having copied the letter to the
Chief Secretary to the Treasury
 
and
 
the
 Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Health.  Ms Baker was the
Scottish Government aware of this request being made
to the Treasury?

--Result #333--

  
And then
, 
just looking at that penultimate
sentence of the letter
, "
I cannot stress enough the
urgency of taking long 
over
due action on financial
support and compensation
", 
Ms Gougeon, does the
Scottish Government
, 
or do you
, 
I should say
, 
in your
capacity 
as
 Minister
, 
agree with what's said there
that it's urgent to take action on financial support
and compensation and that this is long 
over
due?

--Result #334--

  
If we then just go to the wording of the
March 2021 announcement, Soumik, it's RLIT
000
149
8, and
I'm going to look first of all at the Paymaster
General's statement and then the Scottish Government's
statement.
We can see here this is 
a 
statement by the
Paymaster General 
a 
written statement I think
:
"
Today 
I am 
providing
 
an update
 on parity of
financial support, the commitment to considering
a 
compensation framework, and enhancements to the
psychological support for the victims of the infected
blood tragedy."
Under the heading 
"
Parity
"
, she refers 
to
 
a
UK-
wide
 agreement in July 
2019 
in principle to resolve
disparities in treatment
, 
and then 
a 
reference to
a 
meeting in January 2020
 that 
the UK Government held
 
79
with campaigners
.  
And then says
 -- 
confirms that
:
"... 
the following changes are planned to the
four separate schemes to bring them into 
broader
parity
.  
Increases in annual payments will be
backdated to
 
April 
2019
.
"
Et cetera.
Then if we skip over the 
changes
 to the English
scheme
, 
because those are for others
 
to answer
questions about
, 
if you 
go
 
a 
little further down we
can see paragraph:
"In Scotland
, 
the changes are to increase annual
payments for infected beneficiaries and bereaved
partners
, 
and to introduce
 
£
10,000 lump sum
bereavement payments for the families of those
beneficiaries who have 
died since the scheme began."
Then
,
 again
,
 Wales and Northern Ireland
 
we'll
come on to in the course of the week.
If we go over the page
, 
top of the page she
says:
"We've agreed with Health Ministers that any
future changes 
to
 national schemes 
would
 be subject to
consultation between the UK Government and devolved
administrations."
Then under the heading 
"
Compensation framework
"
:
"To meet the Government's commitment to consider
 
80
a
 framework for compensation
, 
we can confirm our
intention to appoint 
an
 independent reviewer to carry
out 
a 
study, looking at options for 
a 
framework 
for
compensation
, 
and to report back to the Paymaster
General with recommendations before the inquiry
reports.
"
The terms of reference of this study will 
be
finalise
d
 
in 
consultation between the 
independent
reviewer and those infected 
and affect
ed
.  The study
will include 
consideration
 of the scope and levels of
such 
compensation, and 
the relationship between
a 
compensation 
framework and the 
existing financial
support schemes 
in place.  
"
The study is 
entirely separate from the public
inquiry
 ..."
Et cetera.
Before I ask you 
a 
little more about this
, 
if we
can just look at the Scottish Government statement at
SIBS0000129
.
Again
, 
we can see this is dated 25 March 2021.
If we 
go
 
a 
little further down the page
, 
so we can see
the text of the rest of the page
.  
Thank you
.
So we can see 
it
 says:
"Following comments about the disparities

Chair
 of the Infected Blood Inquiry ... agreement has
been reach
ed
 in principle between the four devolved
governments to reduce 
these disparities
.
"The Scottish Government is still waiting for
confirmation of funding details from the UK
Government ..."
As I understand 
it
, 
Ms Baker
, 
you are still
waiting 
for
 
that
?

--Result #335--

  
Then going back 
to
 -- 
I don't think we need
to put 
it
 on screen again but if we just go back to
the Paymaster General's 25 March 2021 announcement,
that indicated that future changes to the schemes
would be the subject of consultation between the four
nations.  If we leave aside 
for a moment the
compensation
 framework 
issue, 
which 
I 
will come 
on
to
in a moment
,
 
first of all,
 is the Scottish Government
,
Ms Gougeon
, 
committed to there being 
a 
consultation
and close working between the four nations for the
future
, 
to try 
to 
ensure
 that disparities do not creep
back into the system?

--Result #336--

  
Just then asking you
, 
if I may
, 
about the
compensation framework
, 
which we saw referred to in
the Paymaster General's announcement, what
,
 
if any,
involvement has the Scottish Government had in that
aspect of the Paymaster General's involvement --
announcement?  So the appointment of 
a 
review to
explore 
a 
compensation framework
.

--Result #337--

  
Having
, 
as I understand 
it
, essentially 
seen
that announcement for the first time when it was made
by the Paymaster General on 25 March, does the
Scottish Government have any expectation as to who
would 
fund
 any compensation framework
?

--Result #338--

  
Finally
, 
can I ask you both to look at
WITN1146038.  If we 
go
 to the next page, you will see
this is 
a 
response to 
a 
Freedom of Information request
and if we 
go
 to the third page, we can see 
a 
table
giving the numbers of patients who were
 -- 
or
individuals who were members of the SIBSS scheme who
had died
.  
Deceased
 since 1 July 2017, 53
; 
deceased
since 28 February 2020, 11.  This was as at
3 August 2020
, 
so now doubt there will have been
others who have died since.
Ms Gougeon, would you accept
, 
in light of the
numbers of people infected as a result of their
treatment who have died and continue to die
, 
that it's
imperative that if changes are 
to
 
be
 made to the
scheme
, 
whether by 
way
 of increased parity or other
changes or 
a 
compensation framework
, 
that those
changes should be made as soon as possible?

--Result #339--

  
If we 
could
 then just go back to the
Paymaster General's letter to the Chancellor
,
EIBS0000705, 
go
 to the bottom of this page where the
paymaster says
, 
under the heading
 "
Compensation for
victims
"
:
"
... 
it
 is inevitable that the Government will
 
96
need to provide substantial
 
compensation."
Ms Gougeon, as Minister in the Scottish
Government
, 
do
 
you share the view expressed by the
Paymaster General that 
it
 is inevitable that the
Government will need to provide substantial
compensation to 
those 
infected and affected?

--Result #340--
   In addition to that testimony, the Inquiry 
has of course received a number of other statements ,
again from those infected or from their families, a ll 
of which have been read and considered by the Inqui ry 
before today and I'll refer to some of the themes t hat 
emerge from those statements.  
2In terms of clinical evidence, we have several 
witness statements from Dr Elizabeth Mayne who, as you 
know, sir, will not be giving oral evidence to the 
Inquiry but we have her written testimony, as well as 
a number of earlier reports that she produced in th e 
course of the late 1980s or early 1990s and I'll be
referring to those in some detail in the course of 
today and tomorrow. 
We have a statement from Professor Bridges, 
a statement from Dr McNulty and a statement from 
Dr Anderson, and we are also seeking statements fro m 
other clinicians, and you, sir, will decide whether  to 
hear any oral evidence from any of those clinicians
once you've seen such further evidence, such furthe r 
statements, as the Inquiry is able to obtain. 
We will be hearing on Thursday from a more 
recent perspective from Dr Benson, the current 
Haemophilia Centre Director, and you will recall in
relation to the Cardiff Haemophilia Centre we heard
from Professor Peter Collins, who was in a similar 
position.  Obviously, he cannot deal with the event s 
of earlier decades and we won't be asking him to do
so. 
So that's by way of introduction.  I'm going to 
start with an overview of the centre, its facilitie s  
3and staffing and patient numbers and will then turn  to 
look in more detail at the products that were used and 
the treatment policies gleaned from a number of 
different sources. 
The Belfast centre was established by 
Professor Nelson in 1958.  It was located, at that 
stage, within the hospital's Clinical Pathology 
Department.  Soumik, if we go RHSC0000067_002, plea se. 
This is a report from March 1988 called "A profile of 
the management of haemophilia in Northern Ireland".
I'll come back to it at various stages.  It's autho red 
by Dr Mayne and it appears it was a document addres sed 
to the health authorities in Northern Ireland 
exploring issues about funding of haemophilia care in 
Northern Ireland. 
For present purposes, if we go to the second 
page, we can pick up some information about numbers  in 
the 1950s.  Top of the page there's a table.  1958,  44 
patients with haemophilia A and one with 
haemophilia B.  Dr Mayne tells us, in the sentence 
below the table: 
"In the 1950s no true haemostatic treatment was 
available.  Bleeding episodes were managed with 
infusions of fresh frozen plasma." 
That's a snapshot of the numbers in 1958.  The  
4available documentary and witness statement evidenc e 
suggests that that remained the number of patients 
known to the centre during the course of the 1960s.
There was no -- there were no dedicated staff 
or in-patient facility for haemophilia care during 
that period and no specific physical location for t he 
centre, according to the documents that we have. 
That's in terms of adult haemophilia care.  In 
terms of paediatric care, children with bleeding 
disorders were cared for at the children's hospital ,
and Professor Bridges, who was the paediatrician in
charge there until around 1979, has estimated in hi s 
statement that there were approximately ten child 
patients with bleeding disorders prior to 1979. 
We can take that document down, thank you, 
Soumik. 
We know from the various documents and 
statements that we have that the numbers of patient s 
grew during the 1970s and 1980s and the staff team 
also grew so that from around the 1983 there was 
a part-time physiotherapist, a nurse, a secretary a nd 
some social work input and I'll look in a few momen ts 
at a document which has more detail of staffing in the 
80s. 
The haemophilia centre in Belfast was not                                   
 
                           a reference centre for a number of years, and if we  go 
to HCDO0000405, please, you'll see these are the 
minutes of a meeting of Haemophilia Reference Centr e 
Directors, 26 February 1980, and if we go to page 6 , 
under the heading "Haemophilia Reference Centres in
Scotland and Northern Ireland", we will see the 
question of the status of the centre being raised:
"Professor Blackburn said that patients had 
raised with him the question of Haemophilia Referen ce 
Centres in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  There we re 
at present no official Reference Centres in either 
Scotland or Northern Ireland and some patients were
very worried about this." 
Then there's reference to a DHSS leaflet in the 
70s from Professor Bloom and reference to what was 
said to have been agreed in relation to Scotland. 
Picking it up a few lines down, we then come to 
Northern Ireland: 
"Northern Ireland was included in the Oxford 
supra-region and Belfast was the only Haemophilia 
Centre in Northern Ireland.  After some discussion,  it 
was suggested that Belfast should be regarded as th e 
Reference Centre for Northern Ireland and that 
Dr Rizza should write to Dr Mayne asking if she wou ld 
approve of this idea and if she would like to atten d  
6future Reference Centre Directors Meetings.  This w as 
agreed.  It was also agreed that the Department of 
Health should be asked to put Edinburgh and Glasgow  as 
the Scottish Reference Centres and Belfast as the 
Northern Ireland Reference Centre, in the list of U K 
Haemophilia Centres when this was reprinted." 
We can take that down.  So we can see the 
agreement there that Belfast should become a refere nce 
centre.  One of the significant consequences of tha t 
was that from the point at which it was recognised as 
a reference centre, Dr Mayne was, as it were, eligi ble 
to attend the Reference Centre Directors meetings a nd 
would thus be privy to the information that was 
discussed and disseminated at those meetings from t he 
early 1980s onwards. 
We don't need to go to the document but the 
minutes of a UKHCDO meeting from September 1981 not es
that a Dr Thornton in the Northern Ireland Office o f 
the DHSS had written to Professor Bloom confirming 
that the centre at the Royal Victoria Hospital had 
been designated as a haemophilia reference centre. 
As that document recorded, there was only one 
recognised haemophilia centre in Northern Ireland a nd 
it served patients drawn from all over Northern 
Ireland.  There was a reciprocal arrangement with  
7a centre in Dublin which enabled some patients from
the Republic of Ireland to attend Belfast for 
treatment if that was more convenient and Belfast 
patients to receive treatment in southern centres w hen 
in the Republic. 
We can see that if we go to HSOC0022947. 
You'll see this is a copy of The Haemophilia Societ y's 
Bulletin.  There's a publication for 1989. 
Soumik, if we go to page 9, and if we look at 
the heading, "The centre", so it's the second one,
that's it, the first paragraph:
"The Northern Ireland Haemophilia Centre serves 
a population of 1.5 million.  Its patients are draw n 
from all over the province and a reciprocal 
arrangement is operated between the Centres in Belf ast 
and Dublin.  This enables a small number of familie s 
from the Irish Republic to attend Belfast for 
convenience of travel, otherwise they would need to
make a long and tedious journey to Dublin.  In retu rn,
patients from the Northern Ireland Centre who go on
holiday in the Republic of Ireland are treated free  of 
charge at appropriate southern Centres." 
We can see a question that arose about how that 
should be dealt with in financial terms from 
an exchange of correspondence between Dr Mayne and  
8Professor Temperley from Dublin. 
Soumik, if we could go to BHCT0000623, please. 
We can see that in September 1984 Dr Mayne was writ ing 
to Professor Temperley about a particular patient.  If 
we go down so we can see the text of the letter, an d 
in the second paragraph -- it's a patient who had 
attended the centre in Belfast for treatment it wou ld 
appear whilst on holiday in the north.  In the seco nd 
paragraph she says this: 
"I enclose a total of the amount of factor VIII 
that he has received while in the North and I suppo se 
the simplest method of payment would be for your 
Centre to send our Centre the same amount in kind 
rather than involve our respective finance officers ." 
So it would appear that Dr Mayne contemplated 
that concentrate from Dublin would be sent to Belfa st 
as a payment in kind rather than some form of 
financial charging arrangement.  Before we look -- 
sorry, next paragraph she says: 
"Perhaps when we next meet we might discuss 
this type of problem, as of course, it will arise f rom 
time to time." 
If we just look at the last paragraph of that 
letter you will see reference to the "Blood Club" a nd 
she says:                                   
 
                           "... I am sorry I will not be able to be at the 
Blood Club later this month, as I was already 
committed to a haemostasis meeting in London." 
This appears to have been some kind of 
a gathering for Northern Irish and Irish clinicians  to 
discuss matters relevant to haematology.  It may ha ve 
overlapped with or fulfilled a similar function to 
that which we've described as -- that which we've 
heard described taking place under the auspices of 
Professor Savidge.  It may be the same, it may be 
something different or it may be something that 
performance a similar function; we've not got any 
further information at present. 
Turning to the issue raised with 
Professor Temperley, we can see his reply at 
BHCT0000622.  He says in his response of 
10 October 1984: 
"I think it would be rather silly to charge 
each other for treatment of [haemophilia] during sh ort 
visits North or South of the border.  This should i n 
the ordinary course of events balance out.  On the 
other hand, I agree when prolonged treatment is 
envisaged for a citizen of the Republic in Northern
Ireland we should make suitable compensation as we 
discussed?  Perhaps you might give the question  
10 of short visits more thought." 
I won't go to Dr Milne's subsequent letter but 
she agrees there's no need to charge for short visi ts. 
Whether there transpired any exchanges of concentra te 
in kind, as it were, for longer visits, the 
documentation doesn't tell us one way or another. 
Soumik, can we go back to The Bulletin article,
so HSOC22947 -- sorry, HSOC0022947, my apologies. 
If we go to page 8, we can pick up, in the same 
article, a little more information about the staffi ng 
arrangements.  This is by the 1980s, late 1980s.  W e 
look at the heading "Staff", we can see this is the
position by 1989: 
"The permanent medical staff of the Centre 
comprises three Consultant Haematologists: one the 
author [that's Dr Mayne], who has overall 
responsibility for province-wide haemophilic care,
aided by the Professor of Haematology, Professor 
Bridges, and Dr Dempsey, who carries responsibility
for all paediatric activity in the Centre.  Sister 
Catherine Farrell is the Sister-in-Charge of the 
outpatient facilities; she is on the committee of t he 
Haemophilia Nurses' Association and is the present 
membership secretary of that organisation.  She is 
ably supported by Staff Nurse Colette McAfee.  In t he  
11 ward, Sister Mary McGuigan keeps a close eye on 
haemophilia inpatient problems.  Both are members o f 
the Haemophilia Nurses' Association, as are many ot her 
ward nurses, making a total of seven members at the
present time." 
So that's nursing staff. 
In terms of physiotherapy staff, we learn in 
the next paragraph that in 1983 a part-time 
haemophilic physiotherapist was appointed initially , 
and for a further number of years she was funded by
The Haemophilia Society. 
"Mrs Lynne Crockard has proven her worth time 
and time again." 
Then if we go to the next paragraph we find 
details of dental care, a dentist there identified who 
has provided consultant dental care and runs a prim ary 
care clinic devoted to the management of patients w ith 
bleeding disorders. 
There's then reference to the various 
laboratory staff, the Senior Chief MLSO, Mr Carvill e,
who is said to have been in charge of blood product
provision since the late 1960s, when cryoprecipitat e 
was prepared locally in the department, and then 
Dr Mayne continues: 
"After the transfer of its manufacture to the  
12 Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service, he beca me 
in some respects what might be described as 'the 
keeper of the privy purse'.  He has never allowed t he 
stocks of blood products to run dry and he and his 
staff in the hospital Blood Bank are responsible fo r 
issuing all the material for home treatment. 
"They maintain computerised records of the same 
and indeed all treatment -- a job important and so 
necessary for the compilation of the annual returns
for Oxford.  No Haemophilia Centre can exist withou t 
accurate laboratory tests to establish the diagnosi s 
and to maintain monitoring of the effectiveness of the 
treatment given and the Chief MLSO Terry Ingles, ha s 
been in charge of the Coagulation Laboratory for mo re 
than 12 years.  More recently new additions to the 
staff have taken place." 
So we see reference in the next sentence to 
there being a permanent secretary for the haemophil ia 
centre and a scientist. 
The next paragraph refers to the involvement of 
a professor of orthopaedic surgery.  Then in the la st 
paragraph, under the heading "Staff", Dr Mayne pick s 
up on the question of social work, and says this: 
"In the past the Northern Ireland Haemophilia 
Centre was not overwhelmed by help or interest in                                   
 
                           3 terms of input from social workers.  Some came and 
went, some showed interest and occasionally when 
an excellent one was appointed, she had to leave,
having gained promotion.  Others declared that the 
problems of haemophilic patients were 'insoluble'. 
However, the picture during the past year has chang ed 
since the appointment of Miss Geraldine Kerr, the 
social worker is now closely involved and is rapidl y 
making her mark in the Centre and amongst the 
patients." 
So that's the picture in terms of staffing 
by 1989.  Obviously at earlier stages far fewer sta ff 
members. 
If we could then turn to BHCT0000503, you will 
see the date of the document at the bottom.  It's 
1 August 1985.  That's actually the second page of the 
document, so if we could go to the next page, which  is 
where it begins, this would appear to be a document
authored by Dr Mayne.  Certainly in terms of its lo ok 
and style, it sounds like Dr Mayne.  It's headed 
"Northern Ireland Haemophilia Reference Centre 
Factor VIII usage".  I'll no doubt come back to it 
when we look at blood product usage but for present
purposes this provides an update of information abo ut 
numbers of patients.  The first sentence suggests t hat  
14 the centre became a designated reference centre 
in 1976.  As we've seen from UKHCDO minutes, that 
would appear to be incorrect.  But, in any event, i n 
the second paragraph we then see the number of peop le 
registered in 1984/85 as suffering from inherited 
bleeding disorders, 189 persons broken down as ther e 
set out: so 124 with haemophilia A; 16, haemophilia  B;
45, von Willebrand's disease; 2 with Factor X 
deficiency; one with Factor XIII deficiency; and on e 
with Factor XI deficiency. 
Then we see in the paragraph below that:
"Out of this number of patients, 63 are 
residential and drawn from the Eastern Health Board
area.  Some 25 of these originate from the North an d 
West Belfast District.  The remaining patients are 
equally divided between the other Health Boards -- 43 
from the Northern Board, 43 from the Western Board and 
40 under the aegis of the Southern Board." 
She explains below that:
"In order to simplify the treatment of these 
patients, all the blood products necessary for 
treatment are held at the Reference Centre and issu ed 
to other hospitals in the Province, specifically 
designated for individual patients." 
Then I'll leave that document now because I'll  
15 come back to what it says about products in due 
course. 
We have various further figures in relation to 
increases in patient numbers and we can pick that u p 
in terms of the modern picture and the picture over
recent years from the evidence of Dr Benson on 
Thursday. 
The article in The Bulletin, I won't go back to 
it, but it also shows development of the physical 
facilities such that by 1989 there was a day centre
and an in-patient unit with 16 designated beds, and
Dr Mayne's article suggests that at least a quarter  of 
those tended to be occupied by haemophiliac patient s 
much of the time. 
There is also reference in the documents to 
a joint haemophiliac and orthopaedic clinic being h eld 
every three months by March of 1988, and we've seen
reference in that article to there being a regular 
dental clinic. 
Again, just sticking with an overview of the 
facilities and services at the centre, if we go to 
LOTH0000051_089, we'll see a short document from 
January 1992.  It's confidential, to the Haemophili a 
Centre Directors of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and 
it's a report on clinical audit from 1991 and it se ts  
16 out the results of clinical audit visits. 
If we look at the list of centres, Belfast was 
audited by Dr Ludlam, and that's centre 2, and if w e 
look at the recommendations made by the auditors in
the list below for centre 2, what Dr Ludlam apparen tly 
picked up on his audit visit to Belfast in 1991 wer e 
issues about privacy of bedside and telephone 
conversations, and there's a suggestion of dedicate d 
rooms and staff and a need for more social work and
physiotherapy input. 
If we look a little further down the page, the 
last section of the document says:
"Replies were received from patient 
questionnaires as follows ..." 
So it would appear that the audit involved 
a patient questionnaire process.  And for centre 2 -- 
I don't know whether "n equals 5" suggests that the
number of replies received were 5 -- and it picks u p 
upon those replies having suggested that 
HIV counselling --

So if we 
go
 back to the letter
 -- 
so
 if we 
go
 back to
page 1 of the document
, 
please, Soumik -- we can see
under the heading
 "
Compensation for victims
", 
the
Paymaster General sets out her view that it's
inevitable the Government will need to provide
substantial compensation
.  
Then if we 
go
 over the
page, in her last paragraph
 
she says:
"I cannot stress enough the urgency of taking
long 
over
due
 action on financial support and
compensation."
I'll
 come on to the issue of compensation
separately
, 
if I may, so if we can leave that aside
for the time being.  Did the Northern Ireland
Executive or your Department have any involvement in
the process of providing information to the Chancellor
or any involvement in the formulation of this letter
or was your involvement simply limited to providing
the Northern Ireland costings?

--Result #342--

Then if we 
go
 to the announcement then some six months
or so later by the Paymaster General
.  
Soumik
, 
we have
it
 at WITN4066017 -- WITN4066017.  RLIT0001498 -- 000.
You should have that.  Can you try again
, 
the first
one
 
I think we did run through
, 
WITN4066017.
So we can see this is the Paymaster General's
statement on 25 March 2021
, 
and we can see she says
,
if we 
go
 further down the page:
"Today 
I am
 providing an update on parity of
financial support
, the commitment to considering
a compensation 
framework
, 
and enhancement
s
 to the
psychological support
 ...
"
Then under the heading
 "
Parity
", 
she refers to
UK-wide agreement in principle to resolve disparities
in July 2019.  Reference 
then 
to 
a 
meeting between the
UK Government and campaigners
, 
January 2020
, 
and then
she confirms changes planned to the four separate
 
54
schemes to bring them into broader parity.
If we just go 
as
 little further down the page,
we can see reference then to the elements of change
for England and then
, 
bottom of the page
, 
she says:
"
... 
the schemes managed by the devolve
d
administrations 
in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland will be similarly adapted 
so that across the
UK 
there
 
is
 broad parity of payments to infected and
affected people."
If we 
go
 over the page, third paragraph
, 
we can
see what she says about Northern Ireland:
"In Northern Ireland
, 
the changes are to annual
payments 
for
 non
-
infected bereaved spouses/partners,
lump sum bereavement payments, and 
a 
commitment to
introduce enhanced financial support for Hepatitis C
(
Stage 1
), 
at the same payment levels as in England
,
as soon as 
a 
system can be put into operation.
"
We have agreed with health Ministers that any
future changes to national schemes would be subject to
consultation between the UK Government and devolved
administrations."
Then 
there
 
is
 the announcement in relation to
the compensation framework
, 
which 
I'll
 come back to.
So that's the Paymaster General's announcement.
Can
 
we
 then look at your announcement and then I'm
 
55
going to ask you some questions about the process.  So
you made an
 
announcement on the same day
, 
WITN5570018.
We can see the date is the same, 25 March 2021
: 
"
This statement provides an
 
update on UK four
nation
s
' cooperation to 
achieve 
greater parity of
financial support 
for those infected and/
or 
affected
by contaminated blood 
across the UK."
Then you refer to the review of the scheme which
was underway in Northern Ireland.  Next paragraph
refers to work between your Department and other
Departments
.  
Then if we 
go
 to the bottom half of the
page, we can see 
it
 says this:
"Subject to funding from HM Treasury
, 
I have
agreed to implement a number of changes to the
[
Northern Ireland
]
 Infected Blood Payment Scheme
,
which are intended to achieve greater alignment in
financial support across the UK schemes.  The reforms
are as follows:
"
payments for non-infected bereaved spouses or
partners will increase from 75 per cent of the
deceased beneficiary's annual payment to an automatic
100 per cent of the 
deceased
 beneficiary's payment in
the first year
, 
with 75 per cent payable in subsequent
years.  
Th
is is in line 
with
 the policy in Scotland
and will be backdated to 1 April 2019
 ...
"
 
56
Then second bullet point:
"the introduction of enhanced support payments
for eligible Hepatitis C Stage 1 beneficiaries, in
line with rates paid in England 
and backdated to
1 April 2019 -- subject to a model being developed 
in
consultation with stakeholders
 ...
"
Third is:
"the 
£
10,000 
be
reavement lump sum 
[
you referred
to this earlier Mr Swann
], 
will now also be payable to
the Estate of the 
deceased in cases where there is no
living spouse 
or partner
, 
in line 
with
 the position in
England and Wales.  This will be back
dated
 to
1 April 
2017 
..."
Then finally
: 
"
the lump sum payment to 
a 
Hepatitis C Stage 1
beneficiary will increase from 
£
20,000 to 
£
50,000
 ..."
You say that's 
a 
policy in line with the
position in Scotland
 and 
will be backdated to
1 April 2017.
Sorry
, 
I said 
"
finally
", 
but if we 
go
 over the
page
 
there's one further element
, 
top of the page:
"The lump sum payment to an HIV beneficiary will
increase from the current range of payments up to
a 
maximum of 
£
80
.5k (
depending on circumstances
)
 to
an
 
automatic 
£
80
.5k, 
backdated to 1 April 2017
 ...
"
 
                                 
19 May 2021

     
                        7
I just have a number of questions arising out of
both 
the process and the nature of the changes being
made.  
Can
 
we
 
go
 back to the previous page, bottom
half of the page.  So we can see
, 
Mr Swann
, 
that your
announcement there is said 
to
 
be
 subject to funding
from HM Treasury and we
 
heard yesterday from your
Scottish counterparts that they are still waiting for
formal confirmation of the funding.  What's the
position in relation to Northern Ireland?  Are you
still waiting for some kind of confirmation from the
Westminster Government and
, 
if so
, 
what's your
expectation
?

--Result #343--

We can take that down, thank you, Soumik.
I just wanted to ask you finally about the
Paymaster General's announcement of 
a
 -- 
work on
a 
compensation framework.  Was that something which
had been raised with or communicated to you or to the
Department of Health in Northern Ireland in advance of
the Paymaster General's announcement?

--Result #344--

Do you or the department have any particular
expectations as to what your involvement might be
 
in
the process of developing 
a 
compensation framework?

--Result #345--

Do you share the view expressed by the Paymaster
General in that September 2020 letter to the
Chancellor that it's inevitable that the Government
will need to provide substantial compensation to the
infected and affected communities?

--Result #346--

  
In doing so, you 
would have been
talking to people from Northern Ireland inevitably.
 
                                 
19 May 2021

     
                        9
Are there any particular features of life in Northern
Ireland or their experiences
, 
which
, 
from your
perspective
, 
may have 
a 
relevance to any payment
scheme or compensation scheme?

--Result #347--

In relation to the announcement about the compensation
framework, was that something that you had been in
discussion with Westminster about prior to the
announcement on 25 March this year?

--Result #348--

  
So 
it
 might follow
 -- 
this is
a 
question really inviting 
a 
comment
 -- 
it
 might
follow
, 
might 
it
, 
that if it was accepted that there
was 
a 
moral case that anyone who had suffered
a 
bereavement as 
a 
consequence of HIV infection from
those
 -- 
of those from whom they were bereaved
, 
at any
time previously would be losing out in the sense of
 
                                 
19 May 2021

     
                        21
being given compensation for that
 
because 
the
Government back in the 1980s and since had chosen to
establish the Alliance House organisations as they
did.  Would 
that be 
fair or would 
it
 not?

--Result #349--

Well,
 these are
 -- 
it's the successor scheme 
to
 the
old Alliance House scheme that 
came
 up
, 
as we have
gone through
, 
in an
 ad hoc
 
way
 
and
, 
in honesty
, 
my
understanding is these are support payments to reflect
 
40
the fact that something had gone wrong, to reflect the
harm 
and
 
the
 distress
, 
but also really to try to
provide some practical support for people
.  
And we get
into the position of there being no recognition of
formal liability and 
a 
desire not to admit liability.
I understand why people do that 
from
 
time
 
to
time
 -- 
I used 
to
 
be
 
a 
lawyer
 
in the old days when
I had 
a 
job that people understood and respected
 --
but the reality is that there's been 
a 
long-standing
desire not to call these 
"
compensation payments
", 
but
in reality they are what many people understand 
to
 
be
something like that
 
and
, 
once you have these
 ex
 
gratia
payments in place
, 
with 
the
 
practical support that
they provide, you've got to find 
a way
 to deliver them
fairly.
I've tried not to get too 
tied
 up into whether
they are or 
aren't
 compensation
.  
I've
 
tried to focus
on the practical 
impact
 the payments have and how we
deliver fairness and support
, 
why is why some 
of
 the
changes we've run through in the scheme was more about
more money.
But that's my honest understanding of what's
happen
ed 
and
,
 
as I say,
 
I've
 got an 
im
perfect
understanding of how the schemes were put together in
the past.  I have 
a 
much 
clearer
 understanding of my
 
                                 
20 May 2021

     
                        1
role as 
a 
decision
-
maker 
in 
trying to do the right
thing since 
I 
became the responsible minister
.

--Result #350--

We've looked over the last two days at 
a 
letter sent
by the 
Paymaster General to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in September 2020 but you have helpfully
exhibited to your witness statement an
 
earlier letter
,
and if we'll just look at that
, 
its WITN5665005.
So this is 
a 
letter from Penny Mordaunt
,
Paymaster General
, 
13 July 2020
, 
to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer.  
If we 
pick 
it
 up at the 
bottom 
of the
page
 "
Financial support
", 
she says in the second
sentence of that first paragraph:
"Ministers 
and
 
the
 pre
vious 
Prime Minister have
committed to address disparities across the UK in the
levels of financial support providing by the four
devolved schemes."
There's reference then to the previous Minister
within the Cabinet 
Office 
and
 
the
 Parliamentary 
Under
Secretary of State for Health having
: 
"... 
met 
with
 campaigners 
and
 committed to
a number of actions.  This included resolving the
 
78
remaining disparities in financial support in Wales,
Northern Ireland
, 
and Scotland
, 
and addressing as far
as possible broader issues of disparity
, 
including
support for bereaved partners 
(
beneficiaries in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland are 
severely
disadvantaged compared to beneficiaries 
in Scotland)
.
"The Departments of Health across the four ...
nations are 
costing the amounts needed to achieve
parity for beneficiaries
, and 
we expect this work 
to
be
 completed shortly.  
The 
resolution of these
disparities is one of the 
main requests of the victims
and their families, and my strong belief 
is 
that it
would 
be the right thing to do."
Then we can see then the reference to
compensation for victims.  
It
 refers to Minister
Dowden having 
written
 to the Prime Minister in
January 2020 and then she says
, 
in the second
paragraph
, 
picking 
it
 up in the second line:
"
... 
I
 
believe
 
it
 
to
 
be
 inevitable that the
Government will need to provide substantial
compensation."
Then she goes to set out a number of thoughts in
that
 
regard.  She says her officials are working with
: 
"[
Department of Health and Social Care
]
colleagues to consider approaches to compensation.
 
79
Any decision on compensation will require careful
consideration
.
"
If we go to the next paragraph:
"Experience of other Inquiries suggests that
early action 
could
 
s
ave the Government significant
legal costs as well as provide victims with
compensation as soon as possible
 ...
"
I
 
believe
 the best arrangement would be to view
this scheme as part of the NHS's existing compensation
schemes."
She then says she would like
 "
to discuss
 
the
merits of 
doing
 this work with your officials as soon
as possible
".  
Then if we just look at the bottom paragraph she
explains she's copied this 
letter 
to the Chief
Secretary to the Treasury
, 
the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Health 
and the Health
Ministers of Scotland, Wales 
and Northern Ireland.
We can 
see 
there the reference to work 
being
undertaken by the four Department
s
 of Health to
provide costings and
, 
is this right
, 
the Welsh
Government
, 
through its officials
, 
submitted
an
 
estimate of costings to the Cabinet Office in the
summer of 2020 or thereabouts?

--Result #351--

Then just for the sake of completeness, we'll look
,
although we've looked at 
it
 already this week
 
but
obviously
 not with you, Mr Gething, at the
September 2020 
follow-up
 letter from the Paymaster
General
, 
EIBS0000705.  So this
 
is 21 September 2020
and if we just look 
a 
little 
further down the page we
can see she then refers
, 
under the heading 
"
Financial
support
"
 in the second paragraph
, 
to the costings that

following five years.  If we go over the page, we can
see in the last paragraph
, 
the last written paragraph
,
she says:
"I cannot stress enough the urgency
 
of taking
long overdue action on financial support and
compensation."
Would you agree, Mr Gething, that action on
financial support and compensation was long 
over
due?

Part of the announcement made by the
Paymaster
 
General on 25 March 2021 was about setting
up or undertaking commissioning work in relation to
a 
compensation framework.  Is that something that you
or your officials had prior notice of or any prior
involvement in before the Paymaster General's
announcement?

--Result #353--

It
 certainly wasn't part of the conversation that
I recall having with health ministers on 11 March.
Obviously,
 I welcome the fact that 
there
 
is
 what looks
like 
a 
serious attempt to address the issue of
compensation
, 
but 
it
 happened in a subject to any sort
of ministerial conversation that I've been part of.
I'd expect 
though, 
in reality
, 
that should 
the
undertaking
 -- 
it was going 
to
 
be
 done by officials
working with each other in the first instance.  So 
it
may be that's 
a 
matter for my successor in 
the 
health
role
, Eluned 
Morgan
, 
to address
, 
but that does depend
on 
how 
the compensation scheme is proposed 
to
 
be
 set
up
.

--Result #354--

Is 
it
 your expectation that the Welsh Government will
have some involvement in or be consulted on the
discussions and proposals and principles about
a 
possible compensation framework?

--Result #355--

Is 
it
 your expectation that funding for any
compensation framework would come from the
UK
 
Government?

--Result #356--

I can understand the moral case that is made and I'm
not unsympathetic to it.  The challenge is we have
a 
current set of support schemes that are drawn up in
a specific 
way
, 
and it's really about how
 -- 
if the
compensation schemes are 
to
 
be
 real
, 
how you then
understand those people that have been direct
ly
impacted by the need 
to
 provide care and support as
well as those people who suffered financial loss as
well as those people who have been bereaved.  So, yes,
I recognise the point that is being made
.

--Result #357--

I'm not aware of all the detail of those discussions
but I would expect that they would be part of
discussions about not just parity in the scheme going
forward but also the unfinished
 -- 
well
, the r
ecently
started conversation 
of 
whether 
there
 
is
 going 
to
 
be
a 
proper compensation scheme
.

--Result #358--

Has any discussion -- 
has there 
been any discussion
about 
whether 
EIBSS might be asked to administer the
compensation framework that's being contemplated?

--Result #359--

Only in that
, 
as we know who the beneficiaries are
, 
if
a 
compensation framework is agreed and established and
we know the bank accounts
, 
as well
, 
of the
individuals, it would seem sensible for us 
to
 
be
involved in that.  The detailed specification of that
I do not have and
, 
ultimately
, 
the Department might
decide to give 
it
 to somebody else or do 
it
themselves.  But I would imagine that it would be
EIBSS
.

--Result #360--

  
The current scheme is not -- sorry
, 
it
 is not
a 
compensation scheme.  
It
 is 
a 
support scheme.  It
was set up like that and I know that that's one of 
the
questions that the Inquiry will no doubt address.

--Result #361--

  
The justification that was given was that
that was -- was that this is 
a 
support scheme for
redress of financial hardship
 
as 
a 
consequence of this
tragedy
, 
as opposed to 
a
 compensation scheme to
compensate 
those
 who have suffered 
a 
wider injustice
and loss
.

--Result #362--

  
Well
, 
we
 
are willing to look at all
conside
rations put forward by the Inquiry and we've
set up the Robert Francis Review to look into how that
could
 come about
.  
But
, 
in a 
way
, 
the question that
you're getting at is about the question of whether the
scheme should be about compensation or about support.
So I think it's worth cutting to the chase
, 
rather
than dancing around that.
The honest truth is this was set up 
as 
been
a 
support scheme
, 
as 
an 
ex gratia
 scheme
, 
as we
 
151
discussed, but I have no doubt that this is something
that the Inquiry will look at and I would expect 
it
to
, 
and I respect the process of the Inquiry and
I will respect its recommendations
, 
and should the
Inquiry's recommendations point to compensation, then
of course we will pay compensation and Sir Robert
Francis's Review on compensation is there in order
that 
the
 Government will be able to respond quickly to
that.
But it would be wrong to pre-empt the findings
of the Inquiry on that basis
, 
by me giving 
a 
policy
recommendation in the middle of 
it
, 
and so I think its
best
, 
no matter
, 
you know
, 
where I would like this to
go
, 
what I would like to happen is would like the
Inquiry to explore all of these questions
, 
but what
I can say to you is that we will respect the outcome
of the Inquiry and if the Inquiry points to
compensation
, 
as opposed to 
a 
support scheme
, 
in the
future then the Government will pay compensation
.

--Result #363--

  
I'm just going to 
press
 you 
a 
little more on
this
, 
if I may.  Leave aside the question of what
might ordinarily be understood as compensation and
just look at the question of support and what you say
is the
 raison d'etre
 the rationale of the 
current
scheme
, 
which is to 
provide a 
degree of ongoing
financial 
support to 
those
 who have suffered.
Payments are made by 
way
 of bereavement payment,
the lump sum payment
, 
there will now be the regular
payments
.  
Without there being
,
 
as I understand it,
a 
requirement
 -- 
so it's made to the bereaved spouse
or partner without there being 
a 
requirement to show
a 
particular need for support
.
A 
parent who has lost 
a 
child
 may -- 
and I'm
going to just give 
a 
hypothetical example but 
it
resonates with much of the evidence the Inquiry's
heard
 -- 
be so scarred by that that they are unable to
work or unable to work in the 
way
 in which they would
have 
done 
and they may have as great 
a 
need for
support or 
a 
greater need for support than someone
else.
Why is the scheme drawn -- why is the scheme
,
understood as 
it
 currently is as 
a 
support scheme and
not 
a 
compensation scheme
, 
nonetheless drawn so
narrow
ly
 that only certain categories of relative can
 
154
receive support
.

--Result #364--

  
Then you will see she refers then under the
heading
 "
Compensation 
for

" 
to her views in
relation 
to

will come back to that in

a few moments.  If we then go 
to
 
her 
second letter to
the Chancellor
, 
EIBS0000705
, 
we can see she wrote
again on 21 September 2020 to the Chancellor 
of 
the
Exchequer
: 
"... 
writing to update on the Infected Blood
Inquiry 
..."
She refers 
under 
the heading
 "
Financial support
"
to the costings from the four nations
, 
and then she
moves to the question of
 "
Compensation for victims
",
says
: 
"It is 
inevitable that the Government will need
to provide substantial compensation
."  
Then over the page
, 
last paragraph
:
"I cannot stress enough the urgency of taking
long 
over
due action on financial support and
compensation."
She refers to copying the letter to the Chief
Secretary to the Treasury and to your Department
,
Mr Hancock
, 
and then I think 
the handwritten note is:
"We have ideas about a solution to this and have
been 
trying to 
for
 some time to secure 
a 
meeting with
you."
Do you know
, 
Mr Hancock
, 
whether the Paymaster
General was able to secure 
a 
meeting with the
Chancellor of the Exchequer
.

--Result #365--

  
Do you agree with the view expressed by the
Paymaster General that action on financial support
 
and
compensation was long 
over
due
?

--Result #366--

  
Well
, 
I'm very glad that since this letter
was sent we have been able to take action to resolve
matters in terms of financial support with respect to
parity and that's -- and I'm really pleased that we've
been able to do
.  And 
then when 
it
 comes to the wider
question 
and 
compensation
, 
as we've discussed
, 
I think
the appropriate thing to do is to respect the results
of the Inquiry and we set the Sir Robert Francis
Report
, 
as we discuss
ed
 earlier
.

--Result #367--

  
I think I correctly understood Mr Hancock's
earlier evidence and your own to indicate that 
there
 
187
is
 no
 -- 
if we leave aside
 
Sir Robert Francis'
compensation review
, 
there
 
is
 no current 
plan
 to
consider extending the scheme to wider categories of
the bereaved
; 
is that correct
?

--Result #368--

  
Just before I move to my final set of
 
188
questions
, 
which is about the compensation framework,
the evidence we heard from Wales and Northern Ireland
this week about what their understanding is of how
long this money is available for 
I think 
suggested
that
 -- 
there's the backdating element and then it's
here for another year
, 
the funding.
Is that right or are these changes intended 
to
be
 -- and
 the funding available
 -- 
for these 
to
be 
permanent features of the scheme going forward for
all four schemes
?

--Result #369--

  
If we then just go over the page to the
heading 
"
Compensation framework
"
, we see there from
the Paymaster General the announcement 
of
 the
appointment of
:
"... 
an 
independent
 reviewer to carry out
a 
study
, 
looking at options for 
a 
framework for
compensation
, 
and to report back to the Paymaster
General 
..."
Again
, 
the evidence we've heard from other
ministers suggested that this was not something that
they had
 been sight
ed
 on in advance
, 
or at least not
long in advance.  Was this proposal something that the
Department of Health 
was
 aware of?

--Result #370--

  
From the Department's perspective
, 
are you
able to commit to publishing any submissions or
representations that the Department makes on the terms
of reference of the review or the options for
a 
compensation framework
?

--Result #371--

  
But if the Department makes submissions
about either the terms of reference to 
Sir
 
Robert or
to the 
Cabinet 
Office, and 
if the Department makes
submissions about
 -- 
or provide evidence about the
options for the framework for compensation
, 
will the
Department commit to sharing that with the infected
and affected?

--Result #372--

Then if we then come to the decision that 
was
 
then
finally 
provided to the Society by the Secretary of
 
56
State for Health, Soumik it's 
DHSC
001

534
,
28 July 1998, addressed to Mr Hodgson
, 
the chair of
The Haemophilia Society:
"As you know
, we have 
been giving lengthy and
very careful consideration to The Haemophilia
Society's proposal that 
haemophiliacs who have been
infected with hepatitis C 
through NHS treatment should
receive special payments.  The Government has
proceeded on the basis that compensation or other
financial help to particular patients or groups of
patients is only paid out where the NHS or individuals
working in it have been at fault, the needs of people
whose condition results from inadvertent harm
 
is met
from benefits available to the population in general
.
I am sorry to have to tell you that after considering
all aspects of this matter 
we have
 decided that we
should not make an exception to the general rule in
the case of haemophiliacs infected with hepatitis C."
Then the 
following paragraph rejects the
Society's view that haemophiliacs could be treated as
a special case.  Then if we go down the page, in
response to the argument that those with hepatitis C
are
 in a similar position to those infected with HIV,
Mr Dobson says:
"
... 
we take the view that the circumstances of
 
                                 
27 May 2021

     
                        7
the people infected with HIV were different.  The
stigma surrounding HIV at the time the decision was
taken
, 
the fact 
th
at it was generally 
considered
a sexually transmitted disease and that haemophiliacs
could have inadvertent
ly
 infected their partners were
all important considerations 
that
 do not apply to
Hepatitis C."
Then if we go over the page, there's reference
in the first paragraph to a possible project in terms
of the provision of 
information
 and advice for young
people.  Then, in the last paragraph, Mr Dobson says:
"I realise that
, 
although this commitment will
be welcome to you [the one in the previous paragraph
],
as was my earlier decision to make recombinant
Factor VIII available to children under 16 and to new
patients, this response on special payments is not
what your Society was looking for.  This has been
a difficult decision to make and we have looked at 
a
number of alternative approaches but I'm sorry to say
that none of them seemed the right thing to do."
Two questions I wanted to explore with you,
Ms Pappenheim.  The first is
, 
if we look at that last
sentence
, "
we have
 looked
 
at number of alternative
approaches
", 
as far as you can recall, did the
Department of Health ever discuss with you the
 
58
alternative approaches referred to here
 
and ask for
your input on them
, 
or give you any understanding of
what those alternative approaches might be?

--Result #373--

If we just look at that briefing paper
, 
it's

Over the page

you 
refer 
there
 
to lack of unity
within the organisation, "In

then
 "
Lack of legal 
'

you say of 
a 
legal dimension and you compare that to
the HIV litigation and the pressure that applied
; "
Low

Then we can see "Ideas for future action".  You
say -- you 
are
 asked whether there was
: 
"...

being used by 
the

"
If we go to the top of the next page, you refer
to drawing 
on the lawyers' 
lines of argument which
could add a very different dimension to the moral
case
.  
Then redefining the campaign's content

Were your -- again, there's more documentation
we can look at if need be
 
but
, 
broadly speaking
, 
were
the ideas that you were here putting forward accepted
by the board
, 
in particular the suggestion that the
campaign would now seek a public inquiry?

Haemophilia Society
, 
Mr Hodgson
, 
met with Lord Hunt
.  
And if we go to HSO
C
002038, please, Soumik.
We can see 
this is a letter dated
24 January 2000
.  It's 
from Lord Hunt in his capacity
as 
Parliamentary 
Undersecretary of State, 
and 
it's
addressed to Mr Hodgson
:
"Thank you for your letter of 23 November to the
Prime Minister about the provision of compensation or
other financial help to people with haemophilia
infected with hepatitis C
.  
He has asked me to reply
as this is my responsibility, and of course I met with
you and Karin
 
Pappenheim on 30
 
November and we
discussed many of the issues raised in your letter.
"At our meeting I made it clear that we have
great sympathy for haemophiliacs who now have
hepatitis C as a result of treatment.  However, I also
made it clear 
that
 our policy remains that
compensation or other financial help is only given to
people who have suffered harm in this way when the NHS
has been at fault.  We do not believe that we should
make an exception to that general rule in the case of
people with haemophilia infected with hepatitis C."
So again, just pausing there before we look at
the next paragraph, do you have any independent
recollection of the meeting with Lord Hunt,
 
78
Ms Pappenheim?

--Result #375--

Is it right to understand, from this, and the
reference to the chair's letter and the reference to
the meeting, that the Society was still trying to get
the Government in Westminster to consider the case for
compensation or financial support
?

--Result #376--

If we just go to the Paisners letter
.  
If we go to the next page, please, Soumik.
We can see it's a letter addressed 
to
 you dated
2 
November 2000.  
If we go to the next page 
we can see
halfway down the letter 
-- the page is
 a heading
"Concerns about the Campaign
", 
and it references to
Mr Taylor's concerns, and we can see those in italics.
The 
"Legality of the campaign", I'm not 
going
 
to
 ask
you anything more about that
, 
and 
we
 see 
the
 advice
given was that it
 "
does fall within the Societ
y's
objects
"
.
"Legality of members of the Society seeking
financial compensation
.
"
And again, I'm not going to ask you about that
because reassurance is given by the solicitors
 
in that
regard.
But if you go over the page, we'll see that the
third concern voiced by Mr Taylor 
was
 about
 "
The
likelihood of the Campaign being successful and the
factors which the Trustees must consider
", 
and it
records Mr Taylor's view
:
"[He] 
does not believe the Society will obtain
the reversal of Government policy which is
, 
of course
,

                        3
a refusal to hold a full public inquiry and to
compensate haemophiliacs who have been infected with
hepatitis C through contaminated blood products."
The basis 
for
 Mr Taylor's views 
are
 then set out
and 
then 
there 
is
 legal advice about the way in which
the trustees should take a decision on these matters.
The question for you, Ms Pappenheim, is
: 
did
 
you
share Mr Taylor's doubts about the prospects of
success of the campaign?  And was it your view at this
point in time that the time had come to draw an end to
it?

--Result #377--

We'll look at what the board decided 
at 
the next
meeting in a few minutes, but just sticking with this
document, if we go to the next page, if we can 
zoom
 in
on the top half of the page, there's paragraph 2,
"Conduct of trustees" it says this:
"The 
CEO 
[
so that's 
you] had expressed concern
that the minutes of the Tayside group's AGM state
d
that Philip Dolan 
had
 told the meeting that '... in
Scotland we 
are
 still campaigning for compensation and
not financial recompense or assistance or hardship
fund
 ...'.  
She said that she had expected him as
a 
trustee to take the opportunity to explain that the
Society 
no
 longer used the term 'hardship
', 
and added
that there was a need for the Society to present
a consistent message."
Then there's reference to the matter 
that 
will
be discussed more fully together with the wider
subject of devolution 
later 
in the meeting but before
 
119
we look at that later discussion, this records you
expressing the view that Philip Dolan should have
explained in Scotland that the Society 
no
 longer used
the term "hardship
".  
Now
, 
we've seen
, 
just
 
a few
months previously
, 
the Society's own publications
using the terminology "hardship fund
" 
and "hardship"
in the sense you've described, and indeed, you've told
us it was quite important to use the term 
"
hardship
"
was it conveyed the serious situation, the 
grave
situation in which many found
 
themselves.
Why is it then being recorded here that the
Society 
no
 longer used the term 
"
hardship
"
?

--Result #378--

We can 
take that
 down, thank you
.
Now
, 
it was over a year later
, 
in August 2003
,
that the announcement 
was
 made in 
Scotland, 
and then
a companion announcement made by John
 Reid
, 
the then
Secretary of State for Health, about the provision of
some form of financial 
recompense
.
Perhaps we'll just look at one document in
relation to that which records your response.
It's HSO
C
0003277.
So 
a 
statement from The Haemophilia Society
following the Scottish 
Health
 
Minister
's announcement
that he would like to 
offer
 
compensation
 to those
infected with hepatitis C
.  
And you're recorded as
welcoming the Health Minister's agreement with the
principle of offering financial assistance.
Disappoint
ment that 
 
the figures
:
"... 
fall far short of the payments proposed by
the Expert Group
 ..."
That's the 
Ross 
group
.
"... 
and 
... 
no
 provision has been made for the
 
134
surviving 
dependents of those 
who 
... 
died
 ...
"
Then if we go to the next page, we can see The
Haemophilia Society responding to the announcement by
John
 
Re
i
d that the Government will set up a financial
assistance scheme for people with 
haemophilia 
infected
with hepatitis C
.  
And we have there Lord Morris on
behalf of the Society making a statement in response
to that
: "
a major breakthrough for 20 years of
campaigning
"
.
Do you recall, whether from the Society's
perspective, this announcement in August 2003 came out
of the blue from the Scottish and Westminster
governments, or had the Society been involved in the
Government's decision
-
making?

--Result #379--
   We're going to come to the Health  
22 Committee in just a moment, Bill, but just in terms  of 
this petition, this was submitted, a separate petit ion 
was submitted by someone else calling for 
a compensation scheme for those who'd contracted 
hepatitis C from blood transfusions and the two 
petitions went forward together, didn't they? 

--Result #380--
   Soumik, could we have the letter that 
went to Bill, WITN2287026.
We can see there the bullet points that I've 
just read from the report, and then the last paragr aph 
on the first page: 
"The Minister considers it an important general 
principle that the NHS should not pay compensation for 
non-negligent harm; she acknowledges that medical 
treatment often necessarily involves a balance of 
risks.  She would like to repeat her expressions of
sympathy to haemophiliacs infected through blood  
27 products, as indeed to all people who have suffered
inadvertent harm through medical treatment. 
"She also notes that the exercise failed to find 
evidence of any policy by Haemophilia Centre Direct ors 
deliberately to mislead patients about the risks of
hepatitis.  She cannot deal with individual cases 
where a patient believes he or she was nevertheless
misled, although she sympathises with any patient w ho 
was unable for whatever reason to appreciate the ri sks 
of their treatment." 
Again, what was your reaction to that part of 
her letter?

--Result #381--
   Let's pick that straight up. 
If we can have WITN2287029. 
If we go to page 3, this is a news article that 
you've exhibited to your statement which is headlin ed
"Records reveal minister unease over blood scandal                                   
 
                             9 payouts", published in January 2017. 
And if we go over the page, we can see that the 
article says this: 
"The newly-declassified papers from 2001 show 
the then Scottish Executive feared paying out up to
£20m to people affected by the scandal."
A little further down: 
"The documents released by the National Records 
of Scotland under the 15-year rule show ministers 
feared making payouts to 400 patients who received 
contaminated blood between the 1970s and 1991 becau se 
they thought it would create a precedent for 
compensation and lead to 'immense future 
difficulties'. 
"Susan Deacon, health minister at the time, said 
defending the claims would mean the Executive would
look 'unsympathetic' but said her 'inclination' was
for court action because of the wider implications. " 
Bill, that's obviously something that you read 
about later than the letter from her. 

--Result #382--
   If you look at the second bottom line there, 
this was Susan Deacon in -- I mean, let me work thi s 
out -- around about 2001, 2002: 
"A worse-case scenario (sic) involving 
compensation to around 400 people might cost us £20 m." 
It took us 15 years to get there, because of 
that point of view! 
So yes, the money, the money has to come from 
the Treasury.

--Result #383--
   I just make a comment, yes.  I think the 
reality is that the Government cannot pay currently
for its responsibilities in Northern Ireland, and t hey 
would be looking to Government in England to increa se 
payments that come in so that they could manage the ir 
responsibilities.  From that point of view, it's 
illogical that they could possibly deal with this.
In terms of constraints on Government, this is 
early -- it's early days in terms of how monies wou ld 
be agreed.  Similarly, with Lynne, we were talking to 
colleagues in relation to how arrangements for 
compensation might be delivered, and considering 
different routes for that.  So beyond that, at this
point, I wouldn't really want to comment. 

--Result #384--
   I feel privileged to be here today, giving 
evidence to the Inquiry on behalf of Haemophilia Wa les 
and the people we represent.  The campaign to bring
this disaster into the public domain has succeeded 
because of the continued efforts of victims and 
campaigners against the orchestrated and deliberate
attempts by successive governments and others to 
conceal the truth. 
This campaign has truly been fought on the 
shoulders of giants.  They fought the lack of 
transparency, accountability and willingness to eng age 
for over 30 years, and we will not forget them, or 
their perseverance. 
We have heard in this Inquiry from those in 
positions of responsibility at the time who cannot 
remember, did not keep records or trouble themselve s 
to understand or accurately recall the details that
led to the deaths of over 3,000 people in the UK.                                   
 
                             33 The lack of transparency, accountability and 
willingness to come to terms with the past to preve nt 
this happening again continues. 
There remains an unwillingness of some to 
properly engage with key individuals and campaigner s 
still excluded from decision-making forums.  There 
still exists a lack of transparency of funding 
sources, to quote the Welsh Health Minister's 
evidence, where, like the medical records, "money 
appears from the back of the sofa." 
And there is still the lack of accountability, 
where families -- sorry, there is still a lack of 
accountability, where people responsible retire to 
enjoy the benefits denied to the infected and their
families. 
Victims and families will never forget what 
happened or the response of those who should have h ad 
their interests at the centre of their duties.  If 
they ever thought Government was their friend, they
now understand it is not. 
We hope the Inquiry will finally get to the 
truth about what happened and ensure that victims a nd 
families receive the compensation and support neede d 
to allow them to live what is left of their lives i n 
the dignity they're entitled to.  
234 Thank you. 
[Applause]

Oh
, 
it does.  Absolutely.
Then BMAL0000031_023, this is the BMA's Third
Statement on AIDS.  This is 1987 now.  If we go to
 
178
page 16, we can see the heading "Consent".
So it's paragraph 3.14.1:
"People should only be tested for HIV antibodies
if they have freely consented to this, and fully
understand the possible implications, because of the
considerable disadvantages to the individual in being
found to have antibodies.  Consent means the ability
to choose, free of duress and with the benefit of
relevant 
information
, what course of action to take.
Moves to test people against their will or without
their knowledge might encourage them to conceal
behaviour that could place them at 
risk 
... and to
avoid seeking medical attention for problems that may
be wholly unrelated to AIDS.  It is essential that the
medical profession commands the confidence of patients
and prospective patients; if patients perceive the
actions of doctors 
as
 contrary to their interests
 
this
will deter them from seeking necessary advice or
treatment to the detriment of their health, and will
undermine the effectiveness of measures aimed at
controlling the spread of infection."
So there a statement in pretty clear terms about
the need for informed consent and not to test patients
for HIV
 
antibodies without their knowledge.
Then confidentiality is dealt with on the next
 
179
page.  So the first paragraph
:
"
The traditional confidentiality of the
doctor-patient relationship must be upheld in the case
of patients suffering from AIDS and HIV seropositive
individuals.
  
According
 to DHSS guidelines, unless the
patient has given consent personal health data should
not be disclosed to anyone for any purpose other than
the healthcare of that patient, except where
disclosure is necessary to prevent the spread of
infection.  As HIV is not spread through casual
non-sexual contact there could be very few
circumstances in which disclosure would be justified."
Then
,
 again
,
 there's a reference to the NHS
(Venereal Diseases) Regulations.  Then the next
paragraph, says:
"With counselling, the majority of infected
individuals can be persuaded voluntarily to inform
their general practitioner, dent
ist 
and sexual
partner
(s) 
of their infected status."
Then in the third paragraph:
"It is the duty of the general practitioner to
ensure that 
information
 is kept strictly confidential
,
unless the patient 
consents
 
to
 disclosure.  Patients
should be strongly encouraged to permit disclosure
when there are firm medical reasons for this, such as
 
180
when undergoing surgery.  In general however, the
fewer people know of a person's antibody status the
more people in 
high
 risk groups will come forward
voluntarily for testing or treatment.  Much of the
pressure for disclosure of patients' antibody status
has resulted from misconceptions about levels of risk
,
which still remain common 
among
 doctors and other
health service professionals.  This indicates the
importance 
of clear eduction for these
 groups
.
"
Then the next paragraph talks about insurance
companies
:
"Insurance companies sometimes ask 
[
GPs
]
 to
provide 
information
 about patients 
who
 
are
 seeking
insurance.  GPs should complete insurance company
forms truthfully to the best of their knowledge, but
should make clear to the patient what 
information
 is
being disclosed
, 
and what the possible implications
may be.  It is then up to the patient to decide
whether the form should be sent."
And then some further narrative in relation to
that.
So that
's
 the BMA's third statement.  We've seen
all the iterations of that statement, in the course of
1985, 1986 and 1987.
Yes
, I think the third statement, it was perhaps
 
                                 
28 May 2021

     
                        81
printed December 1986 but it's not clear whether it
was copyright 1987, so it's not clear the exact month
in which it was published
.
There's then a GMC publication in May 1987.
DHS
C
0003701_028.
If we 
zoom
 in
 a little closer:
"
21st May
, 
1987
"
AIDS
: 
The doctor's duty towards patients
"The Standards 
Committee 
of the 
[
GMC
]
 
are
engaged in considering the ethical implications of the
control and 
management
 of AIDS.  In particular, they
are
 considering in detail the problem
s
 which arise in
this context in connection with confidentiality.  The
Committee have meanwhile drawn to the Council's
attention their concern at recent reports that a few
doctors
 may have been refusing to accept for treatment
patients who 
are
 HIV positive or 
are
 suffering from
AIDS."
Then we see the GMC setting out its view.
"
The Council is seriously concerned at recent
reports
 that, in a small number of cases, 
doctors
 have
refused to provide patients who 
are
 
HIV 
positive
, 
or
are
 suffering from AIDS, with necessary care and
treatment.  The Council expects that the profession
will extend to such patients the same 
high
 standard of
 
182
medical care and support which they would 
offer
 to any
other patient."
Then there's a reference to in general terms,
the propriety of doctors with conscientious objections
to undertaking a particular course of treatment or who
don't have the appropriate knowledge, skills or
facilities in 
referring
 patients elsewhere rather than
treating them themselves
.
But then says:
"
... 
it is unethical for a registered medical
practitioner to refuse treatment, or investigation for
which there are appropriate facilities, on the ground
that the patient suffers, or may suffer, from
a condition which could expose the doctor to 
personal
risk.  It is equally unethical for a doctor to
withhold treatment from any patient on the basis of
a 
moral judgment that the patient's activities or
lifestyle might have contributed to the condition for
which treatment was being sought.  Unethical behaviour
of this kind may raise a question of serious
professional misconduct."
So we have that 
in 
May 1987.  We then have
a publication in June 1987 from the Royal Society of
Medicine, HSO
C
0001488.  This a publication called The
AIDS Letter, and we can see it's volume 1, number 1,
 
183
June 1987.  It is 
headed
 "Trust and 
liability
 of GPs
in question
", 
and it touches on the issue of
confidentiality:
"The emergence of AIDS has forced family doctors
to reconsider long held conventions on patient
confidentiality following conflicting pronouncements
by legal experts.
"
Worries about confidentiality have severely
dented the trust that some patients have in their
doctors, and perhaps more damaging still
 
the
professional image of the medical profession has been
called into question with some GPs reacting with what
the 
[
BMA
]
 has described as 'hysteria'.
"
In April Professor Ian Kennedy, head of the
Centre of Medical Law and Ethics at King's College,
London told the House of Commons social services
committee that GPs may be sued if they do not note in
their medical records that a patient has AIDS
.
"
Professor Kennedy warned that a doctor would be
liable if his partners did not know of the condition
and therefore were not aware of the danger posed to
others and then they advised the patient that there
was 
no
 need to change his behaviour.
"
He further explained that if a GP or 
a locum
subsequently treated an AIDS patient without complete
 
184
medical notes and part of that 
consultation involved
a third party 
(
ie
 
lover, partner or friend
) 
then the
doctor responsible for the absence of notes would be
liable."
This is the bottom of the same page
:
"He also said that GPs could be sued 
if they did
not advise the partners of AIDS victims that they 
are
at risk.  This amounts to a warning that family
doctors must sometimes disregard an AIDS patient
'
s
confidentiality for the sake of people who may be at
risk."
Then there's a contrary legal view
, 
said to be
put forward by a barrister
:
"... 
in the doctor
'
s newspaper
,
 
General
Practitioner
,
 
[
pointing
]
 out that although
confidentiality is not legally absolute
, 
it is
ethically accepted that a doctor is duty
-
bound to keep
a patient's medical affairs confidential
.
  Any breach
of that confidentiality which results in financial
loss to the patient could lead to a claim against the
doctor 
for compensation
.
"
Then I knew there was a reference to
receptionist somewhere in 
the material, sir:
"This 
particular liability also includes surgery
staff employed by a GP, and there have 
already been
 
                                 
28 May 2021

     
                        85
cases where receptionists
,
 
for example,
 have breached
patient confidentiality following the diagnosis of
AIDS.
"... 
this is dangerous ground for GPs
.  
Due to
ignorance, prejudice and simple fear, AIDS sufferers
than lose, along with everything else, their jobs
.
"
Then it suggests that the question of
confidentiality for AIDS patients will remain
controversial 
until settled by the court
s
.
So that's the Royal Society of Medicine's
publication.
What we then get to
, 
in the 
middle
 of 1987, is
a debate within the British Medical Association
 
about
testing patients for HIV without their consent
.  
And
we
 can pick it up I think probably in a letter
 -- 
or
a letter written to the British Medical Journal in
July 
'
87 at BMAL0000031_027.
We see in the bottom right-hand corner, under
the heading "Aids
: 
a faltering step":
"Last week the annual representative meeting of
the BMA passed by 183 to 140 votes a motion saying
that doctors should be allowed to test a patient for
antibodies to 
... (
HIV
)
 without first gaining consent.
The debate 
was
 largely concerned with what the
proposer called 'occasional circumstances' but the
 
186
motion did not contain that phrase and nor did most of
the reports in the media.  The BMA thus appears to
have departed from the advice given by both the World
Health Organisation and the Department of Health and
Social Security
, 
and
, 
in our view, the decision might
do serious damage to Britain's attempt to contain the
epidemic of 
... (
AIDS
)
."
If we go over the page, left-hand column, first
main paragraph.
"The clinical, ethical
, 
and possibly legal
reasons why last week's decision is wrong 
are
 worth
repeating."
Then the first refers to the risk 
to
 healthcare
workers and says
 
the risk of healthcare workers
becoming
 infected is 
"
very small
"
.
Then we go to the next paragraph:
"The second clinical argument against the
decision is that testing without consent will do
little if anything to reduce the chances of 
becoming
infected."
Then
 if we go to the next paragraph
:
"The clinical arguments for testing without
consent 
are
 thus marginal, but those against 
are
considerable.  Patients who 
are
 told that they 
are
infected when they never even knew they were being
 
187
tested may experience substantial psychological and
social consequences.  And who 
will
 tell the patient?
Certainly anybody who considers testing a patient
should be prepared to counsel the patient fully when
a result proves 
positive
.  A recommendation to see an
AIDS 
counsellor
 as quickly as possible is not enough
on its own.  The doctor who has done the test without
consent is also likely to have destroyed his
relationship with that patient."
Then there's then some background and context to
the BMA debate and then if we go to the right-hand
column, second paragraph:
"Most important of all
 -- 
and here we enter the
ethical arguments
 -- 
when 
doctors
 say that it is
acceptable to test patients without consent they 
are
likely to destroy the trust that those 
at 
risk of HIV
infection 
... 
have in doctors
.  We have 
no
 chance of
defeating the AIDS epidemic if 
we
 do not have that
trust."
Then skipping a few lines:
"It is a basic tenet of medical ethics that we
do not treat patients without their consent
, 
and we
have to have very good reasons for breaking that
doctrine
, 
as the BMA's Handbook of 
Medical Ethics
emphasises.  In this case
 
we do not have such reasons
,
 
188
although we might have some justification in rare
circumstances."
A 
particular 
example is given about an
unconscious patient being assessed for intracranial
disease.
Then if we look at the last paragraph, the
authors of this letter say:
"We hope very much 
that 
a way can be found to
ameliorate the possible effects of the decision 
[
The
BMA's motion] to test without consent
 ..."
If we then look at BMAL0000031_035.  We have
what's described as a
 "
Summary of debate 
on 
motion
363
: 
testing for 
AIDS", 
and I'm not going to go
through all the arguments
, 
but we can just see the
fourth paragraph refers to
: 
"
Chisholm
 (
opposing
) 
said that the doctor is the
servant and not the master of the 
patient
.  The
patient must consent to testing and must understand
the implications.  If patients cannot trus
t 
their
doctors they will not consult or conceal behaviour
which could put them at risk."
So that's a view being expressed
, 
in opposition
to the motion
, 
by Dr John Chisholm
, 
who subsequently
became a member of the BMA Ethics Committee and is
currently the chair of the BMA Ethics Committee
, 
and
 
                                 
28 May 2021

     
                        89
he has kindly provided a statement to the Inquiry,
giving his perspective on the debate that the BMA
held.
If we can just look at that it's WITN5507
0
01
.
If we go to page 5, please.  We can see the heading
there:
"Annual Representative Meeting Resolution of
1987
"I am
 asked to describe my involvement in the
1987 Annual Representative Meeting 
... 
of the BMA
 ...
and in particular my recollection of the discussions
relating to and conclusions reached about the
resolution
 '
that testing for HIV antibody should be at
the
 discretion of the patient's doctor
, 
and should not
necessarily require the consent of the patient'
 ...
"
Then if we go to the next page, he describes
various other debates taking place about HIV, and
a motion -- this is at the top of the page -- that had
proposed that if someone 
was
 found to have HIV
antibodies then
, 
irrespective of consent
, 
their GP
,
other medical practitioners and other healthcare
professionals might be told of the result.
Then he says this:
"I was not
, 
to my recollection
, 
called to speak
in that debate.  However, it was very apparent to me
 
190
while it was taking place, and during 
the 
other
debates in the session, that significant numbers of
speakers and of those present were in favour of
circumventing normal consent procedures and breaching
patient confidentiality through the taking of blood
without consent in order to test for 
AIDS, 
despite
this being unlawful.  Some contributors to the debates
were seemingly more concerned about protecting
healthcare staff from the risk of infection than about
the rights of patients.  My own position 
was
 that the
normal principles of consent and confidentiality
should be applied
, 
and that all healthcare
professionals undertaking exposure-prone procedures
should take precautions with all patients to avoid or
minimise needlestick injuries and 
the 
risks of
cross
-
infection
.
"
If we go to the next paragraph:
"The BMJ report is accurate in its reporting of
the 
tone and 
nature of 
the debates.  My recollection
of the session on AIDS is that it was undoubtedly the
most 
dysfunctional, confused, 
unruly 
and
, 
at times
,
heated
, 
session I have seen in more than 40 years
attending 
[
Annual Representative Meetings
]
."
He refers then to someone losing control of the
meeting, and then he says:
 
191
"The ARM Resolution was passed against the clear
and correctly ethical wishes of the Chair of the
Council of the BMA 
... 
To my mind the debates had
given a poor impression of the ethics and attitudes of
some of those contributing
, 
in the presence of
journalists from national print and broadcast media."
Then if we go to the next page, paragraph 10,
Dr Chisholm describes how he was asked to go on TV and
be interviewed with the BBC early evening news to try
and
:
"... 
ameliorate the damage done to the BMA's
reputation caused by the 
... 
Resolution
 
and the wider
debate on AIDS
, 
which had included speeches in support
of the 
breaching 
of patient's confidentiality in order
to protect doctors."
Then last sentence of that 
paragraph
:
"It was very clear to me that the policy not to
seek patients' consent and the threats to breach
patients' 
confidentiality were ethically indefensible
and that the policy would have to be revisited."
Then if we go to the top of the next page,
picking it up in the second line:
"It was my view at the time, as I expressed in
the debate, and remains my view, that testing without
consent, let alone
 '
routine or indiscriminate testing
 
192
for HIV without the patient's consent
'
, was not just
inappropriate but wholly unethical."
So 
he 
sets out views in 
no
 uncertain terms.
Sir, the reason, in part, for drawing attention
to that
 
is not just out of, as it were, historical
interest but because you'll recall that some
clinicians
, 
certainly in written
, 
and I think 
probably
oral evidence
, 
have referred to the BMA debate that
took place 
and 
the passing of the motion to suggest
that there was a degree of support for a practice of
testing without the patient's consent.  Therefore
,
it's interesting to see the view of Dr Chisholm
, 
and
indeed
 what we're told 
was
 the position of the chair
of the Council of the BMA about the nature and
inappropriateness of that decision.

--Result #386--
   Good morning, sir.  This week the spotlight 
is on Treloar's, Lord Mayor Treloar School and 
College, which, as is well known to all those 
attending here, was the boarding school for childre n 
with physical disabilities, attended by significant
numbers of boys with haemophilia in the 1970s and 
1980s.  And a school which, uniquely in the country ,
had its own Haemophilia Centre located, as at a dat e 
in the 1970s, actually at the school. 
The majority of those children are, as is now 
well known, now dead.  Some of those who survive 
attend today.
In the course of this week we will be looking at 
what we can learn about Treloar's from the document s 
and from the written statements the Inquiry has 
received.  We will hear directly during the course of 
the week from six surviving pupils and we have, of 
course, already heard powerful oral testimony from 
pupils at earlier hearings. 
We will, I hope, be hearing from the parent of  
2two boys, both attending Treloar's, both infected w ith 
HIV, both dead. 
And on Thursday, we will hear from the former 
headmaster, Mr Macpherson. 
We won't, unfortunately, be able to hear from 
any of the key clinicians who provided treatment to
the boys at the school, Dr Rainsford, Dr Arblaster,
Dr Aronstam, Dr Wassef, all of them are now dead an d 
so we will have to try to piece together from the 
documents and from the memories of those who attend ed 
as much as we can about what happened at the school .
Over the course of the week, through looking at 
the documents and through looking at the oral 
testimony, we will be exploring in particular the 
following issues and themes: the approach to 
treatment; what blood products were used and how an d 
in what quantities; and what, if any, steps were ta ken 
to reduce or minimise the boys' exposure to multipl e 
donors, and that's an issue that I will start to lo ok 
at this morning. 
What, if any, information was provided to 
parents or to the children about any of the risks 
associated with the use of blood products and the 
overwhelming thrust of the evidence you will read a nd 
hear will be to the effect that little or, more  
3commonly, no such information was provided. 
What was or ought to have been known about those 
risks at all material times by the clinicians worki ng 
in the Centre at Treloar's. 
How and when children or their parents were told 
that they had been infected with HIV and/or hepatit is. 
And then research and that will be a major theme 
which we'll look at later in the week by reference to 
a range of documents: the extent to which research was 
being undertaken at the school, and whether that wa s,
in part, a driver for the treatment and the approac h 
to treatment that was administered at the school.
What I'm going to do this morning, however, is 
start with an overview of the school, the Centre, t he 
facilities, and in the course of the morning we'll 
show a documentary or part of a documentary.  It wa s 
one made in the late seventies, called Seventy Year s 
On, and so it doesn't deal with the horrific, the 
tragic, consequences of what we now know happened. 
It's a moment in time which looks at the ethos of t he 
school, the facilities, the services, and so on, bu t 
to give you, sir, an idea of the school as at that 
point in time. 
There's a later documentary, Blood Brothers,
which we will also be showing in full in the course  of  
4this week, and then there's a limited snapshot of 
Dr Aronstam, three or four minutes of video footage ,
talking in, I think, 1987 about the issue of 
compensation and, again, we'll show that in the cou rse 
of the week. 
So, sir, starting then with an overview of the 
school.  The Lord Mayor Treloar Cripples Hospital, as 
it was first called, the brainchild of 
Sir William Treloar, a Lord Mayor of London, and it
opened in September 1908, with the first boys enter ing 
the school in October 1908. 
At that time, the facilities essentially 
comprised two blocks of wooden buildings.  The 
hospital part of the buildings passed to the contro l 
of the Ministry of Health in the late 1940s, while the 
college remained independent and became known as Lo rd 
Mayor Treloar College. 
In 1953, the school located to Froyle.  
And if we look at our first document, Soumik, 
TREL0000517, please.  This is a thesis from 
Dr Aronstam, submitted as part of a master's degree , 
entitled Bleeding Episodes in Severely Affected 
Adolescent Haemophiliacs and Their Management with 
Replacement Therapy.  
We'll come back to this document in the course                                   
 
                             of the week, but for present purposes -- if we go t o 
page 89, please, Soumik -- we can see a little bit of 
the history given here by Dr Aronstam under the 
heading "The independent College".  It says: 
"When the hospital passed into the control of 
the Ministry of Health in 1947, the College remaine d 
independent under the control of the trustees and w as 
then known as the Lord Mayor Treloar College.  It 
remained for six more years in its original buildin gs 
in the hospital grounds and then in 1953 moved from
the old wooden buildings at Alton to new premises i n 
nearby Froyle.  The first term at Froyle began with  44 
boys -- one for each full year of the college's 
previous existence.  By 1954 there were 61 boys in the 
College new buildings, which had planned to 
accommodate another 70 boys, were opened in 1956."
Then we see this: 
"The new larger intake in September of that year 
included for the first time three haemophiliac 
children." 
So boys with haemophilia attending Treloar's, in 
small numbers to start with, from 1956 onwards. 
There are documents which describe the 
facilities at Froyle as excellent, a swimming pool,
a games room, spacious outdoor facilities, and the  
6documentary that we will look at will capture some of 
that. 
We can take that down, thank you, Soumik. 
A school for girls was built at Holybourne, the 
Florence Treloar School for Girls.  That opened in the 
mid-1960s, and the two schools merged to become 
co-educational in 1978 and, at that point, we 
understand the upper school was based at Holybourne ,
called the Lord Mayor Treloar College, the lower 
school at Froyle, referred to as the Lord Mayor 
Treloar School, both operated through the 
Treloar Trust. 
Again, we can see a description of that from 
HSOC0022908, please, Soumik. 
This a Haemophilia Society Bulletin from 1981,
so it's later in time, but if we go to page 4, we c an 
see an article beginning at the bottom of the middl e 
column by Sister Turk, who was the haemophilia sist er 
or nursing sister at Lord Mayor Treloar College, an d 
I'll just read a little of what she says about the 
school's history and establishment: 
"The role of the special school for 
haemophiliacs has always been a controversial subje ct, 
even more so since the widespread practice of home 
therapy, which has enabled many haemophiliacs to  
7attend local schools with reduced loss of school 
attendances. 
"Nevertheless, there are still many more 
haemophiliacs who have, for a variety of reasons, b een 
deprived of a normal schooling. 
"Treloar College provides medical and 
educational facilities for handicapped children 
including haemophiliacs and I am here to tell you o f 
the work done at the college and how this affects t he 
haemophiliacs in our care. 
"Lord Mayor Treloar College was the brainchild 
of William Purdie Treloar, Lord Mayor of London at the 
turn of the century.  He was appalled at the suffer ing 
of the crippled children in the poor areas of the c ity 
and used his influence to launch a national appeal to 
provide medical care and educational facilities for
these children.
"He bought a disused hospital at Alton, a small 
farming town in rural Hampshire which had been buil t 
for the soldiers returning from the Boer War, and t hus 
the first hospital school in the country was opened  in 
1904."
So a slightly different date given there.
"When the [NHS] was formed in 1948, the College 
became a registered charity and moved to its presen t  
8site and the original hospital school became known as 
Lord Mayor Treloar Hospital, now the Regional 
Orthopaedic Centre for Wessex.  The College then 
provided boarding school education for physically 
handicapped boys from the age of 14 years.
"In 1950 ..." 
So, again, we have slightly different dates in 
different documents, but I don't think it matters f or 
present purposes. 
"... a sister school was built nearby on the 
outskirts of the town for similarly affected girls. " 
Then she goes on to say: 
"Over the years the types of handicaps have 
changed -- originally the most crippling disease wa s 
tuberculosis and then poliomyelitis.  In 1970 boys 
suffering from haemophilia were admitted to the 
College ..." 
Again, that's not entirely accurate, but we will 
look at the information we have about numbers.
"... and Treloar Haemophilia Centre was formed 
at the hospital, principally to serve the needs of the 
College, but also to provide facilities in the area
for outpatients." 
And then she goes on, if we go down the page,  
to describe how:                                  
 
                             "... the girls and boys schools amalgamated into 
two co-educational establishments of junior and sen ior 
schools."
And describes there being:
"... 300 children in the 2 schools, of which the 
present number of haemophiliacs is 42."
There were, we understand, and no doubt those 
former pupils who we will hear from this week will be 
able to give us their own recollections, but there 
were, we understand, a number of boarding houses. 
We have a witness statement from Mr Scott, who 
was a housemaster from 1981 onwards, and he describ es 
a junior house for those aged 7 to 11 and then thre e 
houses for students ages 11 to 16.  His recollectio n 
was that pupils were allocated to the boarding hous e 
on the basis of age rather than as a result of havi ng 
a particular disability.  He describes there being 
dormitories for between two and four pupils in each
boarding house and his recollection was that meals 
were eaten in the boarding house.
He says that pupils with haemophilia were in 
boarding houses with others with different 
disabilities but that the pupils with haemophilia 
moved to the college site at the end of school year  9,
at the age of 14, rather than the age of 16, when  
10 other students moved up, because that was where the
Haemophilia Centre was located.
So that's Mr Scott's recollection, joining the 
school as a housemaster in 1981. 
The boarding house each had a housemaster, later 
called a care manager, and Mr Scott describes this as 
a pastoral role with some basic care elements.  The
care staff in turn were supported by physiotherapie s, 
occupational therapists, speech therapists and medi cal 
staff.  Mr Macpherson, the headmaster from whom we 
will be hearing from later in the week has estimate d 
that about 40 qualified nurses and 30 therapists 
delivering different types of therapy, physiotherap y, 
speech therapy, occupational therapy, were employed  at 
the school and college, managed by Dr Patricia 
Tomlinson, who was the college medical officer from
1978 to 1994. 
Again, if we go to some documents to flesh out 
some of the early or earlier facts about Treloars a nd 
the admission of boys with haemophilia, go first to
HSOC002843, please Soumik.  This a Haemophilia Soci ety 
publication from July 1964 and if we go to the seco nd 
page we can see the heading there "Lord Mayor Trelo ar 
College": 
"Many members will be aware of the Lord Mayor  
11 Treloar College for physically handicapped boys,
situated near Alton, Hampshire. 
"Boys are admitted from the age of 11 ..." 
Pausing there, we will see from other documents 
boys being admitted from the age of nine at a later
stage.
"... application usually being made by their 
Local Education Authority, and they must be conside red 
capable of following a normal routine and of derivi ng 
benefit from one of the courses provided.
"From the age of 16 training courses are 
provided leading up to, for instance, the Technical
Examinations ... of the City and Guilds of London 
Institute or the Diploma of the Faculty of 
Secretaries.  The College enlists the aid of Youth 
Employment Officers and Ministry of Labour Disablem ent 
Resettlement Officers when the time comes for the b oys 
to find suitable employment. 
"At the invitation of the Warden, Mr Heywood, 
four members of the Committee, accompanied by 
Dr Katharine Dormandy, late of the Hospital for Sic k 
Children, Great Ormond Street [and, of course,
subsequently a significant figure at the Royal Free ]
and [she was] known to many members, recently visit ed 
the College.  They were given the most interesting  
12 insight into its work and activities. 
"Of a total of 130 boys there are at present 26 
haemophiliacs attending the College, this being the
second largest group of boys suffering from the sam e 
disability."
Pausing there, we see that from the first three 
boys admitted in 1956, by 1964 the numbers had grow n 
to 26 boys with haemophilia.
"The party were shown the various classrooms, 
workshops, dormitories, sick bay, dining room and 
indeed all the most impressive buildings and ground  of 
the College. 
"The excellent facilities available include a
fully equipped swimming pool, games rooms and spaci ous 
grounds allowing for the pursuit of outdoor 
activities.
"Acquaintance was renewed with some of the 
haemophilic boys who came to the Christmas Party la st 
December.
"The specialist treatment haemophilics sometimes 
require does, in relation to the present accommodat ion 
in Alton, impose a restriction upon the numbers 
accepted by the College, but a close liaison is 
maintained with the local hospitals and also the 
haemophilia specialists at Oxford."                                   
 
                             1 which the Inquiry has received.  Again, I'll just g ive 
some examples.  If we go to WITN00044001, and we go  to 
the third page, top two paragraphs: 
"I went to Treloar College just before the age 
of 11 commencing in September 1979.  My parents wer e 
simple Welsh Valley people who held the medical 
standard and doctors in very high esteem and truste d 
their word.  They never would have questioned their
advice.  They were very stoic.
"I was a bright child and my parents had tried 
to get me into a school in Bristol, but this was 
deemed not suitable.  Professor Bloom had 
conversations with my mother and Treloar's appeared  to 
be a solution.  I boarded at Treloar's from 1979 un til 
1987 when I left aged 18 and 8 months.  During my t ime 
at Treloar's I was never consented for treatment an d 
never signed any consent form."
Again, we can see both from the documents that 
we've looked at and from this and some other 
statements I'll refer to shortly, that placements a t 
Treloar's were arranged by centres all across the 
country, it wasn't simply centres near in the vicin ity 
of Hampshire but from across the country, placement s 
were made at Treloar's, with the active involvement  of 
the home Haemophilia Centre. 
22 If we go to WITN4641001, this is a witness 
statement from Mrs Sheila Squires, talking about he r 
late son, Peter.  If we turn to page 5, we can see 
paragraph 22 here, the involvement of doctors at th e 
Royal Free Hospital: 
"My husband, along with doctors at the Royal 
Free Hospital, were keen for Peter to attend the Lo rd 
Mayor Treloar College in Hampshire.  I did not want
Peter to go away from home, but my husband felt tha t 
it would make him more independent.  I must admit i t 
did do him good and he made a lot of friends, who w ere 
naturally all haemophiliacs and so they had a commo n 
bond.  Peter's character was tender and he was alwa ys 
willing to help people and I think it was because h e 
went to that school.  My husband saw Peter pushing 
another boy in a wheelchair when he first went down  to 
visit him."
Again, you'll see there a reference to the 
Royal Free and there are quite a lot of documents t hat 
show that Dr Dormandy in particular had an interest  in 
Treloar's, not least The Haemophilia Society docume nt 
we've already looked at.
Then if we look at WITN1055001, this is e of the 
statements of Ms Carol Grayson and if we go to the 
third page, and look at paragraph 9, they're talkin g  
23 about her husband Peter:
"Peter was a patient of the Newcastle Royal 
Victoria Infirmary from birth which had a regional 
Haemophilia Centre under Dr Hamilton and Dr Jones.  He 
was later treated at a centre in the grounds of 
Lord Mayor Treloar School where he was advised to g o 
by his Consultant being a severe haemophiliac." 
Again, we'll come back to this and some of the 
other statements in the course of the week but you' ll 
see there again the reference to the consultant 
advising admission to Treloar's, both Peter and his
brother also attended the school and so there's an 
example of the Newcastle Haemophilia Centre making 
arrangements or at least suggesting admission to 
Treloar's. 
Then if we go to WITN3648001, and we go to 
page 3, this is a witness talking about her late so n. 
At paragraph 12, we can see saying this: 
"At the Royal Free Hospital" -- 
Sorry, his late son, my apologies: 
"At the Royal Free Hospital,
Dr Katharine Dormandy, the consultant in charge of the 
haemophilia centre, treated [him].  [He] had missed
a lot of school and college due to going to the 
hospital for treatment, so Dr Dormandy suggested he 
24 attend the Lord Mayor Treloar's College because 
everything was there -- he could study and receive 
treatment at the same time." 
Then perhaps, just a last example for present 
purposes, BHCT0001031.  This is an enquiry from 
Dr Mayne in Belfast to Dr Aronstam, May 1974: 
"Dear Dr Aronstam,
"Dr John Bridges who looks after some of the 
very young children with haemophilia, has asked me to 
write to you to enquire regarding the educational 
facilities at Lord Mayor Treloar College." 
Then if we go to the next paragraph down: 
"There are two haemophiliac boys [and she refers 
there to a particular family], one aged seven and o ne 
aged nine ..." 
Last sentence of that paragraph: 
"My query is -- would the college accept these 
children as pupils, are they too young?" 
We will see later in the week, as we look at 
some of the -- in the documents relating to individ ual 
treatment and blood product usage, we'll see close 
contact was usually maintained between the centre a t 
the school and the home centre, and there are many 
examples of detailed letters being written, for 
example by Dr Aronstam to the treating clinician,                                  
 
                             5 explaining what bleeds there had been in a term wha t 
treatments there has been, making suggestions or 
recommendations for treatment during holidays when the 
responsibility would again rest with the home 
haemophilia clinician. 
What's striking is the absence of any similar or 
equivalent communications to parents.  It's very mu ch 
a dialogue undertaken, both at an early stage, as 
we've seen from these materials, and then throughou t 
the boys' attendance at the school, between the 
clinicians, with little involvement of parents that  we 
have been able to detect from the documents or inde ed 
from the written statements we've received. 
Then if we turn just to an overview of the 
Centre itself, the Haemophilia Centre, in the 1960s
and for much of the 1970s, it would appear that 
haemophilia patients at the school, pupils at the 
school, would initially attend the school's sick ba y 
if they had a bleed.  They would then, if they need ed 
treatment, they would be transported at that point to 
the Lord Mayor Treloar Hospital at Alton.  That's t he 
narrative given by Dr Aronstam in his thesis. 
In the late 1960s and 1968, Dr Rainsford, whose 
role we'll come back to in the course of the week, was 
appointed as a research fellow, and again, the  
26 documentary evidence suggests that that led to 
a significant increase in the number of plasma 
transfusions given to pupils.  But, again, those 
transfusions appear to have been given at the Lord 
Mayor Treloar Hospital. 
It was then Dr Rainsford who established 
a coagulation laboratory for the first time at the 
Lord Mayor Treloar Hospital and we can see that if we 
look at AMRE0000011_051.  It's a letter dated 
18 December 1970 and from Dr Dormandy at the 
Royal Free.  It's addressed to a Dr Guthrie, the 
director of the National Fund for Research into 
Crippling Diseases, and it's a letter being written  by 
Dr Dormandy in support of an application for a gran t 
made by the National Fund for Research into Crippli ng 
Diseases to continue to provide funding at Alton.
Again, we may need to come back to this when we 
look at the role of research and the role of 
Dr Rainsford, but we can see here some of the 
developments in the late 1960s, early 1970s:
"Dear [Dr] Guthrie,
"Thank you for your letter of 8th December with 
which you enclose a copy of the application from th e 
Lord Mayor Treloar Trust for a continuation of the 
grant made to them in 1967. 
27 "During the [two-and-a-half] years that there 
has been a Research Fellow at Alton, the strides ma de 
in establishing a research unit there have been 
tremendous.  As you know, this has had to be done f rom 
scratch, and, when one considers that there was, at
first, no Coagulation laboratory there at all, and 
that now they have assays going and research projec ts 
well under way, the progress made has been remarkab le. 
"I appreciate that there have so far been no 
publications but I ask the Committee to bear in min d 
the fact that, when a grant is given to a Universit y,
or some other place in which a laboratory is alread y 
set up, the position is entirely different from the
case as it was at Alton, where equipment had to be 
bought, techniques learnt, and standards set up and
prepared." 
So that's what was done, as we understand it,
after the appointment of Dr Rainsford in 1968, as p art 
of his establishment of the coagulation laboratory:
"Dr Rainsford has done an extremely good job,
which has not always been particularly easy.  This has 
now been fully recognised by all those who have bee n 
involved with his work.  In planning his research 
projects, Dr Rainsford has inevitably laid the 
foundations of a special Haemophilia Unit.  The Wes sex  
28 Regional Hospital Board, which is already financing
a research technician, is expected to take over tho se 
aspects of this very Specialised Unit which have be en 
presented to them as 'routine' treatment.  Before t he 
appointment of the Research Fellow, the junior 
hospital staff are called upon to administer treatm ent 
as they saw fit.  Frequently, this was very 
inadequate.  Moreover, it was entirely without 
laboratory control.  No sooner had the Research Fel low 
set out his protocol for the various regimes, then it 
transpired that the hospital staff were being very 
hard pressed to cope with his requirements.  Now th at 
the Regional Hospital Board has definitely recognis ed 
the tremendous value of 'doing the job properly', i t 
is more important than ever to continue the 
appointment of the Research Fellow, who will now be
able to 'forge ahead' with the projects outlined in
the Research Programme which has been submitted to 
you." 
I will come back to other parts of that letter 
in the course of the week.  But you'll see there, 
then, sir, the development of the coagulation 
laboratory and that development having, in turn,
consequences in terms of treatment and it would app ear 
Dr Rainsford set out protocols for various treatmen t                                   
 
                             9 regimes and the suggestion being that the hospital 
staff there were finding it difficult to cope with 
those requirements. 
In 1972, the Treloar Haemophilia Centre appears 
to have been established for the first time, based 
still then at the hospital, under the directorship of 
Dr Arblaster.  That's what Dr Aronstam's thesis tel ls 
us and, if we go to DHSC0100026_122, we can see som e 
correspondence here from 1971 in relation to the 
provision of funding so this is a letter from,
I think, somebody within the Department of Health t o 
the Wessex Regional Hospital Board, and if we look at 
the first two paragraphs, we can see it says: 
"Dr Rovans has been in correspondence with Dr 
[it might be Rowe], of this Department, about the 
establishment of a centre for haemophiliacs in Nort h 
Hampshire, initially at Treloar Hospital, Alton; an d 
in his letter of 21 May requested an additional 
revenue allocation in support of it." 
We can see the next paragraph reads: 
"I am now writing to say that the Department 
agrees to provide an additional recurring allocatio n 
on revenue account to support this development."
Certain figures are then given.  The next 
paragraph says:  
30 "We should like to have an informal report on 
the centre at an appropriate time." 
So the Centre established in 1972 with some 
central funding, some funding, it would appear, fro m 
the Wessex Regional Hospital Board.  Dr Arblaster w as 
the director, Dr Aronstam an associate director and ,
according to Dr Aronstam's thesis, at the same time
a haemophilia ward was established at the hospital.
In 1978/79 however, the Haemophilia Centre, and 
by this time Dr Aronstam was the Director of the 
Centre, he took up that post in 1977, transferred 
location to now be located at the school.  If we lo ok 
at HHFT0001066_002, we can see some discussion abou t 
that.  This is a meeting of the Wessex Regional Hea lth 
Authority, on 28 March 1979, and we can see that 
Dr Aronstam was in attendance.  Then, if we look at
the heading "Discussion of the scope of the propose d 
Regional Haemophilia Service, its present arrangeme nts 
and workload and likely future trends", we see this : 
"Dr Aronstam explained that the Lord Mayor 
Treloar College has been in existence for 40-50 yea rs 
as a school for physically handicapped children and
that a large proportion of its intake has been 
haemophiliacs.  These haemophiliacs have been 
transported to the Haemophilia Centre at the Lord  
31 Mayor Treloar Hospital to receive treatment as the 
need arises.  The distance between the College and the 
Hospital is about six miles and so there is an 
undesirable delay before treatment can be 
administered.  Under these present arrangements, th ose 
who have to be hospitalised are admitted to beds at
the Lord Mayor Treloar Hospital with, sometimes,
a detrimental effect on their education.  With the 
introduction of co-education in both the Lord Mayor
Treloar College and the Florence Treloar School, 
haemophiliacs live on two sites; treatment is given  on 
a third. 
"The existing Haemophilia Centre [the Centre at 
the hospital] consists of out-patient and laborator y 
facilities and general administrative services.  A ten 
bedded sick bay is sited at the College.  Basingsto ke 
District provides an allocation of £22,000 to Lord 
Mayor Treloar College to cover the cost of three 
part-time nursing staff and medical and surgical 
equipment.  Dr Aronstam considered, however, that i t 
is impractical for the haemophilia laboratory to be
sited six miles from the Ward.  The point was made 
that there is a local haemophiliac out-patient 
population, numbering about twenty-five.  Such 
patients could not be admitted to the College; they 
32 would, therefore, need to be admitted to Basingstok e 
General Hospital."
Then this: 
"Dr Aronstam emphasised the necessity for 
research as the concentration of haemophiliacs foun d 
at Treloar's is unique within Britain.  There is 
a necessity for purpose built treatment areas rathe r 
than a converted sick bay, in-patient facilities, a
laboratory on site, a secretary and a consultant's 
office.  Dr Aronstam also spoke to the need for 
continuous monitoring of the levels of Factor VIII 
given to haemophiliacs in order to compare the 
relative effectiveness of different dosage levels.  He 
favoured a programme of body building to strengthen
muscles surrounding joints and believed that the 
benefits of intensive prophylaxis and the 
effectiveness of DDAVP in the treatment of mild 
haemophilia should be further investigated. 
"During vacations, the children returned to 
their homes; most out-patients are trained to treat
themselves.  It is hoped that ultimately all 
haemophiliacs at the college will be trained to tre at 
themselves." 
Then if we look over the page we can see what 
was being proposed, so top of the next page:                                  
 
                             3 "The cost of the proposed capital scheme was 
thought to be of the order of £250,000.  HGB [that is,
I think, Dr Badan, who was chair of the Wessex 
Regional Health Authority, or the chair of the 
meeting, anyway] spoke to the problem of siting an NHS 
funded building on private property; discussions wi th 
the College Trust are essential.  A second problem 
concerns the investment boundary for capital scheme s 
and finding a place in the capital programme.  Ther e 
is provision for £250,000 in 1982/83 in the capital
programme; this is linked with the projected closur e 
of Lord Mayor Treloar Hospital. 
"Dr Aronstam hopes that ultimately every severe 
haemophiliac adolescent in the country would wish t o 
go to Treloar's because of the quality of the 
treatment provided.  In order to increase the intak e 
of haemophiliacs, there would need to be a reductio n 
in the number of physically handicap children 
admitted.  Such an admission policy would need to b e 
discussed with the College Trust." 
Then there's a discussion about having a
regional representative to establish a link between
Dr Aronstam and the College Trust. 
That is the discussion, there's then a reference 
in relation to Factor VIII usage but I think we can 
34 pick that up in other documents more usefully.
So that's the position being discussed in 
March 1979.  If we go back to Dr Aronstam's thesis,
TREL00000517, and go back to page 90, and we pick i t 
up at the bottom of the page.  So he refers at the 
last four lines to: 
"A haemophilia ward [having] been established at 
the hospital shortly after the designation of the 
Centre and the majority of bleeds were treated ther e 
having first been seen by medical staff at the 
college."
Then: 
"In 1977, Dr Aronstam became Director of the 
Centre, and one year later all treatment facilities
were transferred to the upper school at Holybourne. " 
Now that would suggest 1978 but the document 
we've looked at would suggest more likely 1979.  Bu t 
in any event, what we then get is a description by 
Dr Aronstam as at 1981 of the arrangements, as 
follows: 
"The Haemophilia Centre at present is directed 
by Dr A Aronstam with two full time medical officer s 
assisting.  The Treloar College Upper School Sick B ay 
is staffed with one Sister and 13 part-time nurses.
Four of these are dedicated to the treatment of  
35 haemophilia and are competent to transfuse 
haemophiliacs.  Boys with fresh bleeds or those bei ng 
followed up are seen by medical staff in the Sick B ay 
wing.  Those needing transfusions either transfuse 
themselves or are transfused by nursing staff.  Tho se 
needing bed rest are admitted to the 10 bedded sick
bay unit. 
"The haemophilia laboratory and secretarial 
suite are located at Lord Mayor Treloar Hospital an d 
the laboratory and clinical facilities of a distric t 
general hospital are available at Basingstoke.  A
consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Mr FJ Moynihan, see s 
cases at a joint clinic weekly and major orthopaedi c 
and bleeding problems may be referred to the 
Haemophilia Centre and the Nuffield Orthopaedic Cen tre 
at Oxford." 
That's Dr Aronstam's description of the 
facilities as at 1981. 
You'll recall, sir, the evidence of 
Adrian Goodyear, who talked about the Centre having  an 
open door policy and, again, we'll come back to tha t 
in more detail later in the course of the week. 
We've a statement from Ms Helen Burton, who was 
the headmaster's secretary for a long period of tim e. 
She has recalled Dr Wassef, one of the full-time  
36 medical officers at the Centre, living on site at 
Holybourne, close to the Centre.  Her recollection was 
Dr Wassef was mainly based at the Centre, Dr Aronst am 
worked at the Basingstoke Hospital as well as seein g 
pupils at the Centre.
There was also, as I referred to earlier in the 
course of the morning, a school medical officer, 
Dr Pat, Patricia Tomlinson.  She says in her witnes s 
statement she had no involvement with decision-maki ng 
at the Haemophilia Centre, and medical decisions at
the Haemophilia Centre operated independently of th e 
medical decision-making being made by her and her t eam 
more generally at the school.  And we should just l ook 
at her statement, I think, in relation to that.
WITN5578001.  Her statement tells us she was 
medical officer at Lord Mayor Treloar College from 
1978 to 1994.  If we go to the second page, please,
Soumik, we pick it up -- almost halfway down the pa ge 
it says: 
"The Treloar Haemophilia Centre was for the 
treatment of the boys with Haemophilia.  The 
Haemophilia Centre was a separate unit on the colle ge 
site for the treatment and care of boys with 
Haemophilia.  It was managed by Dr A Aronstam, 
consultant haematologist and Dr M Wassef, assistant  to                                   
 
                             7 Dr Aronstam.  Dr Wassef was on call for Haemophilia
care every day and lived nearby.  There was a day c are 
ward in the Haemophilia Centre staff by a ward 
sister." 
Then if we go further down the page, bottom of 
the page, she says, in terms of her own role: 
"I provided GP care for the students of the 
college when needed.  I advised non-medical staff a t 
the college about the students' needs and liaised w ith 
other health professionals such as physiotherapists . 
This role did not change with time." 
Top of the next page:
"The majority of my work at the college was for 
providing care for students with Spina Bifida, 
Cerebral Palsy, Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and 
other life limiting conditions.  I can recall seein g 
number of boys in the college with what initially 
appeared to be Glandular Fever.  I believe that 
subsequent blood tests showed that they might have 
contracted HIV but I did not request the tests and the 
boys were medically managed by the staff at the 
Haemophilia Centre."
Again, obviously, that's an issue we'll come 
back to in more detail later in the week.
The next paragraph:  
38 "The Haemophilia Centre treated the Haemophilia 
and associated medical problems.  This included blo od 
tests, Factor VIII treatment, joint treatments and,  as 
far as I am aware, management of HIV and Hepatitis and 
related diagnoses.  Non-haemophilia care that I 
provided included other diagnoses that would be 
commonly seen in a GP surgery." 
If we look at the bottom of the page, she says: 
"I had no part in decisions, actions and 
policies formulated by the Haemophilia Centre 
regarding the use of blood products." 
Over the top of the next page: 
"I had no part in decisions regarding particular 
treatments of pupils' bleeding disorders. 
"18.  I had no part in decisions regarding the 
approach to prophylactic treatment of pupils with 
bleeding disorders. 
"19.  Haemophilia was managed by medical staff 
in the Haemophilia Centre." 
Next paragraph: 
"20.  I was not involved in the emergency 
treatment of children with bleeding disorders.  The
pupils would be sent to the Haemophilia Centre by 
College staff or attend themselves. 
"21.  Children with bleeding disorders would be  
39 treated in the Haemophilia Centre.  For more minor 
ailments that could be managed by a GP, they might 
have attended the College medical centre. 
"22.  Blood products were only held in the 
Haemophilia Centre. 
"23.  Generally, as far as I am aware, all 
haemophilia care was given at the Haemophilia Centr e." 
Sir, you'll see the picture there that emerges 
is of the Haemophilia Centre effectively functionin g 
autonomously without the involvement of the school' s 
general medical centre or Dr Tomlinson, as the 
school's medical officer. 
That is largely borne out by the contemporaneous 
documents.  We see multiple documents emanating fro m 
Dr Aronstam, some from Dr Wassef, we see Dr Aronsta m's 
attendance at various meetings and so on, and littl e 
to suggest any kind of active involvement in that 
process by the general medical facilities at the 
school. 
The statements we have also indicate -- sorry, 
we can take that down, Soumik -- that there were 
dedicated drivers and vehicles for transporting pup ils 
initially, before the Centre was located at the 
school, to the hospital, the Lord Mayor Treloar 
Hospital, and then, once the Centre was located at the  
40 upper school, transport between the lower school an d 
upper school as required and that accords with the 
recollection of a number of the witnesses who provi ded 
evidence to the Inquiry. 
Just in terms of, then, of the key staff 
involved with the Haemophilia Centre and some of th e 
names that we will see come up in the documents, we 've 
already seen reference to Dr Rainsford, a research 
fellow, from the late 1960s, who effectively laid t he 
groundwork for the Centre to be established.  His f ull 
title -- his background was military -- was Surgeon
Rear-Admiral Seymour Grome Rainsford. 
There is a picture of him in the National 
Portrait Gallery's archives, which has online the 
standard query "Can you tell us more about this 
person?"  Or any mistakes in anything we've said ab out 
him?  And there's one online entry beneath, on the 
National Portrait Gallery's archive, in April 2019,
from a Dr -- well, from a Peter Kirk (who one assum es 
is the Dr Peter Kirk who worked at the Centre in th e 
1970s) and Peter Kirk has written on this entry on the 
National Portrait Gallery archive:
"I worked with him [Dr Rainsford] initially in 
[Her Majesty's] Factories Inspectorate I think in 
1964."                                  
 
                             1 Then he adds this: 
"He was in charge of blood transfusion for the D 
day landings." 
Then Mr Kirk says:
"I worked with him again in 1972 ... at Lord 
Mayor Treloar [College]." 
So Dr Rainsford, his work, his research work,
we'll come back to, as I say, later in the course o f 
the week. 
Dr Arblaster I've already mentioned: director of 
the centre from 1972 to '76 or '77, and then 
Dr Aronstam became director of the Centre in 1977 a nd 
remained in that position until May 1997.
Dr Mounir Wassef worked as the senior clinical 
medical officer at the Centre.  I'm not sure exactl y 
when he joined but there's correspondence from him in 
October 1978, so he's there by then. 
And there is -- the latest documents that the 
Inquiry has found which refer to him at Treloar's i s 
from April 2003. 
Then Dr Peter Kirk, who I just referred to,
worked at the Centre certainly from July 74 to 
June 1976. 
If we look at HCDO000545, we'll see here 
"Minutes of the second meeting of the UK Haemophili a  
42 Centre Directors' Hepatitis Working Party", dated 
14 March 1978 and, if we just look at the first few
lines, it refers to Dr Craske welcoming Dr Trowell and 
Dr Ellis, and: 
"He then said that he had received a letter from 
Dr Peter Kirk resigning from the Working Party.  He
stated in his letter that he had decided not to 
continue his career in haematology, and was looking
for an opening in general practice".
So we're not entirely sure at present whether 
Dr Kirk remained at Treloar's until this point in t ime 
and then left or whether he had been working elsewh ere 
between 1976 and 1978. 
Again, we'll come back to Dr Kirk's name from 
time to time, and his involvement in research in th e 
course of the week. 
Dr Kirk is based in Canada and has declined to 
provide a statement to the Inquiry and we are not i n 
a position to compel him because he is based outsid e 
the United Kingdom.
There was then Dr Painter.  Dr Painter worked as 
a senior clinical medical officer at the Hampshire 
Area Health Authority and honorary registrar in 
haemophilia, involved with the Centre for a relativ ely 
limited period of time between approximately May 19 77  
43 and September 1978. 
And if we go to WITN5277001, please, Soumik. 
This is a statement that Dr Painter has provided 
to the Inquiry.  If we go to page 6, this was his 
recollection. 
Sir, if we pick it up in the second paragraph he 
says: 
"I was appointed as a Senior Clinical Medical 
Officer by the Hampshire Area Health Authority ... 
with honorary registrar appointments in haemophilia
and paediatrics although I had no specific knowledg e 
and no experience of working in either of these 
disciplines." 
And then if we go to the bottom half of the page 
he was asked to describe -- sorry, if we just go up
slightly, Soumik -- he was asked to describe his wo rk 
at Treloar's insofar as it involved the care of pup ils 
of bleeding disorders, and he said this: 
"With regards to pupils at the College this 
generally meant holding a sick parade each morning to 
deal with bleeds that had occurred overnight.  Once
seen and treatment prescribed the boys would be tak en 
by College transport to Treloar's where the staff h ad 
been alerted by telephone from the College sick bay
staff who was coming and what level of Factor VIII (or  
44 IX) rise had been prescribed." 
So just pausing there, the period of time at 
which Dr Painter was there would be when the Centre
was still based at the hospital, before it had 
relocated to the college premises. 
He says: 
"I followed the existing regime of prescribing 
a 20% rise for joint bleeds and 30% for muscle blee ds. 
I might also go to Treloar's myself to see if I cou ld 
help setting up some of the transfusions.  Another 
sick parade was held late afternoon to help assess the 
effects of treatment. 
"With regards to outpatients (ie not pupils at 
the College) I would normally be informed by staff at 
Treloar's [again, I think he's referring there to t he 
hospital] that a patient had phoned him with a prob lem 
and had been asked to report directly to the 
haemophilia unit.  I would then visit ... examine t he 
patient, and prescribe treatment." 
He makes clear that he never ran clinics at 
Treloar's. 
So involved for a relatively limited period of 
time.  We also have a statement from Dr Roy, Dr Ash ok 
Roy, who worked as a haematologist at the Centre fr om 
1976 to 1990.  He was junior to both Dr Wassef and                                   
 
                             5 Dr Aronstam.  Again, we may look at his statement a t 
a later stage, but he explained his role was to tre at 
and look after bleeds in relation to patients.  He 
didn't have managerial or decision-making 
responsibility. 
There is also reference from time to time in the 
documents to a Dr McHardy, a medical officer there,
for part of the 1970s. 
Sir, what I want to do next is show some parts
of a documentary called Seventy Years On.  It comes  in 
two parts, and what I'm going to suggest is -- or,
sorry, there are two parts of it we want to show. 
What I'm going to suggest is we show the first part
now.  It's about eight and a half minutes.  That wi ll 
take us to the break, and then I can show the secon d 
part, which is another 10 or 15 minutes or so after
the break. 
So, Soumik, could we have MDIA0000140, please. 
And we'll play it up to 8 minutes 44.
Just before we do so, it is a documentary -- 
it's entitled Seventy Years On, it's reflecting 
70 years from the establishment of Treloar's.  Sir,  it 
was made in around 1978, '79.  It's a documentary o f 
its time, made without knowledge of some of what wa s 
then to ensue in the first part of the 1980s, and i t  
46 looks at the broad range of facilities and services
available, not just for pupils with haemophilia but
for pupils with a range of other disabilities.  But  it 
may assist in giving some idea of the physical layo ut 
of the school and some of the facilities that were on 
offer.
So, Soumik, if we can start playing that, 
please.

--Result #387--
 That's a very interesting question.  I was quite la te 
to kind of find myself, sexually, really.  And I th ink 
perhaps HIV may have been kind of, in some cases, t o 
blame about that, because you're 15 years old, you' re 
just kind of working your way out, and then all of 
a sudden you -- crikey, you've got this kind of, yo u 
know, life-threatening disease, so you don't begin to 
think about it, and so you put it off and you live 
a bit longer, and so on and so forth.
But when it actually came to relationships, that 
was really quite challenging for me as an individua l, 
because in some sense we, as haemophiliacs who'd be en 
infected in '84 and '85, had been conditioned to li e,
by the social environment at the time.  And I'm sur e 
most people in this room, if I say the word "iceber g"
they'll know exactly what I'm talking about. 
So the hysteria that the Government created 
and -- basically meant that we were ostracised.  An d 
it didn't really seem right, really.  If you look a t 
kind of what's happening in Covid today and what 
happened then, you know, people with it today get 
a lot of, kind of, like, help and protection and th eir 
families are looked after and you're given financia l 
assistance, and this and that and the other.  Where as  
38 in 1985 you were basically ignored.  Your voices we re 
not heard. 
And when that came to relationships, that caused 
a massive problem in trust.  Balancing that trust. 
I mean, if I started, you know -- thought about dat ing 
you, for example, in 19 -- let's say -- 95, when do
I disclose my HIV status?  If I disclose it on the 
first date you're going to think, "Oh my god, I mig ht 
never see you again".  Alternatively, if I wait a b it, 
your response might be, "Do you not trust me?  Why 
didn't you tell me before?"  So it was a very kind of 
like very difficult kind of balance. 
And the stigma associated with it was very 
challenging.  And I think the stigma associated wit h 
the iceberg and the Government's, you know, respons e 
to it in 1985 was such that the people who actually
wanted to say something couldn't because they'd bee n 
scared into silence.  You know, they didn't really 
have a voice when it came to compensation or anythi ng 
like that.  Because society meant that they would b e 
badly, kind of, affected or, you know, subject to 
discrimination. 
So it wasn't effectively until I, you know, 
I finally discovered that I, kind of, like, preferr ed 
boys rather than girls, that everything kind of fit ted  
39 and made a lot more sense.  And in some sense, for me 
personally, that meant that it was much easier,
because I was looking for a partner in a group of 
people who had experienced very, very similar thing s 
to the haemophiliacs.  You know, the gay community had 
got absolutely -- forgive the pun -- bashed in the 
nineties. 
So in some sense, HIV was not so much of 
a problem, really.  So I'm very lucky to have found
a partner who kind of puts up with my mental health
issues and my, you know, the -- all the issues that
I've parked for 25 years ago that suddenly have 
mounted up, and so on and so forth. 

--Result #388--
   Yeah, I'd just like to read something if 
I may.  
116 Firstly, I'd like to pay tribute to all the 
haemophiliacs of Treloar's.  Many would say that we
put the life into Treloar's.  Some would push the 
boundaries while we were there but on the whole 
I think we were a close knit bunch, and many close 
friendships were formed between us.  I personally 
enjoyed my time at the school and kept in touch wit h 
some of the staff after leaving.  It was through th em 
that I started to learn that, one after another, th e 
haemophiliacs were dying of AIDS.  I had a close ca ll 
too.  But somehow managed to survive. 
Out of the few of us that are left, struggling 
on, some understandably just want to get on with th eir 
lives.  The rest demand the truth for all those tha t 
they made a promise to get answers for. 
We have heard clinicians from many Haemophilia 
Centres give evidence.  Unfortunately, most of the key 
doctors at Treloar's are no longer alive, so 
I appreciate that the job of the Inquiry is made mo re 
difficult by having to piece together many incomple te 
records and to rely on the reflections of those of us 
who were there at the time.
As well as the families of those haemophiliacs 
that have sadly passed, such as parents that should
never have had to bury their sons, I also want to                                   
 
                             17 spare a thought for the students at Treloar's that 
were not haemophiliacs who had formed close 
friendships and relationships with the haemophiliac s 
during this time, and also the care staff and teach ers 
who had little or no knowledge of what was going on  at 
the medical centre that were left to pick up the 
pieces.
With the exception of one or two staff members 
I lost touch with most of those I went to school wi th 
after I left in 1987.  It was only through reading 
a local newspaper article in 2015 featuring the lat e 
Steve Diamond and his wife Sue that I became aware of 
tainted blood, and through joining them I was 
reacquainted with several former school friends and
have also made lifelong friends with many others in
the group.  This meant I no longer felt isolated an d 
we could talk about our experiences openly with peo ple 
who understand.  Love you guys.  And Steve, you rea lly 
were a diamond and are very much missed. 
I also want to pay tribute to those who have 
campaigned tirelessly for many years, including tho se 
who have sadly passed, and those that gave evidence
a few weeks ago.  It is in part down to their sheer
doggedness and determination that we now have 
this Inquiry.  So thank you.  
118 I hope that the Inquiry can bring a closure to 
all those who continue to suffer and, although it 
cannot bring loved ones back or repair the damage 
done, I hope that at least it may lead to some kind  of 
compensation to everyone infected or affected, 
including bereaved parents and children who current ly 
get nothing. 
I thank Sir Brian, the Inquiry team, and my 
legal representatives for all the work so far and w ish 
the Inquiry well.
[Applause] 

--Result #389--

I'm going to come next to ask 
you 
a little about the
issue of compensation
 --

--Result #390--

So if we then just pick up what was said about
compensation from 1985 through to 1987, when you then
left the Department.  We start with PRSE0003350,
please.
So this is February 1985, and if we look at the
bottom half of the page, right-hand column, just below
the heading about Depo-Provera
, 
it says:
"Mr Ken
neth
 Clarke 
..."
No, just above that, please, Soumik, the paragraph
above that.
There is a question from Mr 
Chope: 
"...
 asked the Secretary of State for Social
Services if he has any plans to offer compensation to
persons who contract 
[
AIDS
]
 as a result of receiving
contaminated blood supplied by the 
[
NHS
] ...
"
The answer from Mr Clarke is
:
"
There is only a very remote chance 
of contracting
AIDS from ordinary blood transfusions."
Then this:
"There 
has never been a general State scheme to
compensate those who suffer the unavoidable adverse
effects which can 
unhappily arise
 from many medical
procedures."
We'll see that phrase about "unavoidable adverse
 
112
effects" appears more than once in what's said by
Ministers of either department.  Do you think that's
an apt way, a fair way, to characterise infection with
an incurable disease with a high mortality rate,
unavoidable adverse effects
?

--Result #391--

No, I think that -- I think that -- I mean
, 
it
probably was Ken's view, but it also very much the
Treasury view that we should avoid any plans to offer
compensation, and various Ministers expressed that in
different ways.  
And 
I think rather than 
texturally
analysing the way that Ministers did 
it,
 one should
remember that that was the general policy.  It was
a
 
policy laid down by the Treasury that we weren't
going to offer compensation to people who contracted
AIDS in that way
.  
And the reason for that
 -- 
or the
excuse, you might say
, 
for that policy
 -- 
was that
there had never been a no-fault scheme,
 
no general
State scheme to compensate.
I think what that avoided was the fact
 -- 
which
made -- again
 
which made this a situation with
haemophiliacs different
 -- 
was that we were dealing
here with a new disease.  It wasn't a question that
someone had been deficient or there had been some kind
of fault in dealing with it
; 
the fact was that people
were exploring how they could actually deal with it.

For many, it was okay, but for some it wasn't
 --
anything but okay.  But I think to
 -- I think 
the
trouble was that the Treasury, and again I come back
to the Treasury, the Treasury never went past that
particular point; they just said
: 
there has never been
a general scheme, 
and if
 we allow this one to go
through, then we're going to have all kinds of claims
on the Treasury
.  
And that was their view.  But they
never looked at the point about 
AIDS
, 
or indeed the
point about haemophiliacs with AIDS, because this
would -- we were in an area of unknown.  It
 was 
rather
foolish, I think, to start talking about culpability
in that kind of area
.

34, this is a minute of
15 January 1987 from an 
RF Tooher 
to Mr Harris, it
refers to an
 
earlier minute which you've also
exhibited but I don't think we need to go to that.  It
says at paragraph 2:
"You can expect strong Treasury objections to any
suggestion that a special compensation scheme should
be set up for haemophiliacs because of repercussions
for other medical accidents.  
The Treasury have given

                                                                     17
approval to medical compensation arrangements in very
restricted circumstances.  This is where the medical
risk 
is assessed as being so slight that it virtually
does not exist and where there is a special motive.
An
 
example of the latter has the Treasury's recent
approval for compensation arrangements in respect of
clinical 
trials 
on 
a 
new whooping cough vaccine at the
PHLSB
.  This was agreed on the grounds that it was
desirable to encourage the proposed clinical trials
and the risk involved was 
considered to be
negligible."
It may well be this a
 
question that has to be
posed to the Treasury rather than to you, Lord Fowler.
But are you able to 
assist 
us in understanding what's
being said in that second paragraph, which appears to
be the Treasury will approve compensation arrangements
only in cases where the risk is so small it virtually
doesn't exist
 --

--Result #393--

I don't know.  It's a very convoluted argument.
I mean
, 
the real thing is that 
the 
Treasury had
objected to any suggestion that a special compensation
scheme should be set up for haemophiliacs because of
 
118
the repercussions -- well, rather medical accidents
,
it
 wasn't 
repercussions of 
that
.  
It was that it would
set a precedent for other claims.  That was their
fear.  I think the rest is high class flam, really.

, 
this a letter passing on
to Lord Glenarthur
 
a letter from Dr Ludlam who was
a
 
Haemophilia Centre Reference Director in Edinburgh.
If we go over the page, it's a letter which, in turn,
refers to and encloses a copy of a letter published in
The Times by Dr Peter Jones
, 
outlining the 
case
 for
compensation for haemophiliacs
.  If 
we go to the third
page
, 
we'll see Dr Jones' letter.
He talks in the first paragraph
 
about how
: 
"[
HIV
]
 
has 
added 
an 
intolerable 
burden to the
lives of many families with husbands or sons 
already
incapacitated by haemophilia
."  
He refers in the second paragraph
 
to a hope
that
: 
"... 
time will be found to consider the special
needs of these families
." 
Then 
he 
talks about difficulties with insurance
and mortgage
.  
In the last paragraph
, 
he says this:
"I believe 
that 
these families form 
a well defined
group with a special call for State help.  In the case
of haemophilia, 
the Government should argue neither
 
119
precedent nor an open-ended commitment
, 
because of the
iatrogenic 
nature of infection and the small and
finite 
numbers involved
.  
It would be of great and
immediate benefit if some form of no
-
fault
compensation 
could 
be provided to them."
There is certainly, I think
 -- 
I'm not sure
whether Dr Jones' letter made its way directly to you,
but there is a letter at LO
T
H0000009_022, which
suggests a further correspondence from Dr Ludlam was
passed on
 
to you.  Leaving that
, 
in a sense
, 
to one
side, the case that was being articulated by some of
the haemophilia clinicians to regard those infected as
a special case
, not 
least because of the route of
infection through their NHS treatment, was that ever
substantively considered by the Department, with or
without the Treasury, during your remaining time in
office, which I think was now a few further months
?

--Result #395--

So the case that was being put forward by
, 
we see
,
Dr Jones and Dr Ludlam for compensation or some form
of special support for haemophiliacs infected with
HIV
, 
was that 
and 
those arguments ever substantively
considered by you, as far as you can recall
, 
in the
remaining month
s
 of your time at the Department
?

--Result #396--

We can see she says 
in second
 sentence:
"Some background information about the treatment
of haemophilia may help to provide perspective to the
question of whether or not haemophiliacs have
a special case for compensation for the tragedy of
having had the AIDS virus transmitted to them as
a result of their treatment."
 
                      
22 September 2021

     
                                                                     21
Then if we go over the page
, 
she sets out various
matters, I'm not going to go through the detail of it.
I
 
just wanted to ask you
, 
before we return to the
question of compensation
, 
about what she says at the
top of that second page
, "
Transmission of Infection
".
She talks there about
: 
"In 
1974 
... 
recognised in the UK that hepatitis
was being transmitted through the 
use 
of commercial
Factor VIII concentrates
."  
She 
describes 
non-A, non-B
 hepatitis 
about halfway
down that paragraph.  She says:
"... a chronic hepatitis 
may develop which may
proceed to cirrhosis."
In the next paragraph:
"Apart from non-A non-B hepatitis there are
a number of 
viral 
infections which may be transmitted
through unheated coagulation factors."
I just flag that up because I then want to ask you
to look at the third page.  Under the heading
"Compensation
", 
she says:
"It seems likely 
that 
we have a 
finite 
number
 
of
haemophiliacs who have contracted HIV infection.
Their
 position is pitiful and has attracted great
sympathy 
in particular 
because of the perceived stigma
of the disease which is associated with 
promiscuous
 
122
sexual activity.  The equally sad fact that a 
number
of haemophiliacs will undoubtedly die of chronic
hepatitis as a result of non-A non-B infection has not
been recognised
 public
ly."
Now
, 
just pausing there, Lord Fowler, obviously
much 
of my questioning has focused on AIDS because
that's the particular issue with which you became
associated in 1985 onwards.  I don't know whether you
saw this document, I'm not sure that there is any
evidence to suggest that you did
.

--Result #397--

Then just the next paragraph:
"Some patients are relieved 
of 
their symptoms 
(
say
of arthritis
) by taking non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs which can and
 do cause death.
I find it difficult to advocate that there are any
 
123
special circumstances surrounding the care of
haemophilia which makes their case for compensation
greater than that of other patients who take medicines
which kill them.  That is
, 
of course
, 
provided that
doctors caring for the patients have prescribed their
treatment in a proper manner."
We'll leave aside that 
proviso 
which is about what
doctors 
did 
or didn't do
.  
So we see Dr Smithies
saying we can't advocate any special circumstances.
It doesn't appear from this or any of the other
documents that there was any soul searching on the
part of the Department to consider whether there had
been
, 
not necessarily negligence
, 
but fault or
wrongdoing by governments, success
ive 
governments
, 
the
failure to achieve self-sufficiency in the 1970s or to
recommission
 
BPL at a sufficiently early
 
stage
, 
or
anything
, 
of that matter
, 
that might have made the
case for compensation standout from others.  Do you
know why that was the case
?

--Result #398--

I am 
guessing
, I would have thought that the case was
that they regarded it 
as 
a pretty hopeless case to put
forward, because you had the 
Chancellor 
of the
Exchequer against you, you had the Prime Minister
against you and you had most of the Cabinet against
you, where on earth were you going to get
 
124
a compensation scheme
?  
You just weren't
.

--Result #399--

Now, we looked earlier at the Social Services Select
Committee report 
and 
what they'd said about
counselling, but they also talked about compensation
.
I'm not going to trouble you with looking at the
detail of that but the position when you left office
then in 1987 was essentially that which had been
maintained throughout, which was no compensation
?

--Result #400--
C were, 
however, very important in the origins of the 
recombinant Factor VIII story.  We will look at tha t 
today as well.
The third element of interest to the Inquiry of 
Speywood's work was the production of porcine 
Factor VIII, again, through polyelectrolyte 
fractionation. 
As the name suggests, porcine Factor VIII was 
produced from pig plasma.  The product that was mad e 
using that technique was called Hyate:C.  It was 
primarily used for treating patients with Factor VI II 
inhibitors, and was not in general used for 
haemophilia patients who did not have inhibitors, a nd 
we will examine why that was.
We will hear evidence later today from 
Sarah Middleton, who was, among other roles, the ch ief 
scientist at Speywood for a period during the early
eighties, late seventies and early eighties.  We wi ll 
hear her evidence after this presentation.  What I say 
in the presentation is not intended in any way to  
3pre-empt that evidence.  Her analysis of the docume nts 
may be different to mine, and ultimately, sir, it w ill 
be for you to decide what your analysis is. 
The presentation, as with all of the 
presentations this week, will touch upon some of th e 
documents.  It's not exhaustive.  It is not 
comprehensive.  There are matters that we may have to 
return to later, if that would be of assistance to 
you.  And as, again, with all of the presentations in 
the last couple of weeks, it is limited by the acce ss 
that we have to the papers.  We have a lot of 
material, but we have by no means all of the materi al 
that we would like to have in order to tell the ful l 
story. 
Before turning to the products, it is helpful to 
have a look at the company structure and how that 
developed over time.  A helpful way of doing that i s 
by looking at a document IPSN00000027, please, Soum ik. 
We can see from the front page of this document 
that it is a report prepared by Deloitte, Haskins &
Sells, a firm of accountants, a very eminent firm o f 
accountants, and it is dated 9 December 1981, and t he 
report is headed "Speywood Laboratories Limited". 
The context of the report is that it was 
prepared ahead of a proposed joint investment in  
4Speywood by the National Enterprise Board, who was 
a Government body that's invested money in firms th at 
were, it was hoped, going to go on and make 
a successful business within the UK, and also an 
investment by Prutec Limited, which was the investm ent 
arm of Prudential Insurance.  We will return in due
course to the context of that investment and what 
happened around it, but for present purposes, the 
report is a helpful way of us understanding the 
company and the way that it was structured as of 19 81. 
Could we have, please the second page. 
We can see in the left-hand corner that the 
report is directed to DA Smart of Prutec Limited an d 
I Burns of the National Enterprise Board.  It says:
"Introduction: 
"In accordance with the instructions contained 
in your letters of 26 October 1981, we have carried
out an investigation into the affairs of Speywood 
Laboratories Limited and its present subsidiaries 
('Speywood Group') in connection with a proposed jo int 
investment of £4 million in Speywood Laboratories 
Limited ... by Prutec limited and the National 
Enterprise Board." 
The report refers to Speywood throughout and I'm 
going to do the same throughout this presentation.  If                                   
 
                             we could go, please, to page 3.  The "History and 
Business" section.  The report says this: 
"Speywood was incorporated on 
19th November 1973.  In 1974 the company purchased 
ethical drug products from S Maw and Sons, includin g 
animal plasma fractions for the treatment of 
haemophilia and Zonulysin, an enzyme for the remova l 
of cataracts. 
"By 1978, the main trading activity of the 
company was the sale of Koate (human Factor VIII 
imported from Cutter Laboratories).  This 
distributorship was terminated by Cutter in 1980 
although Speywood are still able to obtain the prod uct 
through a US intermediary.  Speywood continued to s ell 
Koate in the UK under the name of Humanate, but 
stopped in June 1981 when the product licence was 
amended." 
Pause there, sir, to tell you that these are all 
matters that, I will come on to in due course. 
On to the next page: 
"Over the years the company has been seeking to 
improve its animal plasma products.  It has now 
developed a manufacturing process using 
polyelectrolytes developed by Monsanto.  Porcine 
Factor VIII produced by this process and sold as  
6Hyate C is now the company's main product." 
The report then goes on to list subsidiaries and 
former subsidiaries, and we can see at various poin ts 
there have been a variety of businesses: a dietary 
food business, a television projection and ancillar y 
equipment business, a business entitled Vision Medi cal 
Limited.  These had all either been sold off or had
ceased trading, some with losses, some sold at 
a profit.  Then the final one is Cardio Technology 
Limited, and we can see that that was sold with 85 per 
cent of the share capital to a Mr P Hammond, who we nt 
to become the Chancellor of the Exchequer. 
If we could go over to the next page, please. 
Some further businesses, retail pharmacies, and 
then a US company, Speywood Corporation, and a west
German company, Speywood GmbH, which were intended to 
be outlets into those two markets.  But, as the rep ort 
says, the US company has never traded and the Germa n 
company is intended to be used as an outlet that, a t 
that stage, I don't think it was being used.  These
aren't companies that will trouble us today.
What is also clear from the report is that 
Speywood is based in two centres.  There is an offi ce 
in Nottingham, or Nottinghamshire, I should say, an d,
as we can see in the "Future Plans" section,  
7a 10,000 square foot factory on the Wrexham Industr ial 
Estate leased from the Welsh Development Agency. 
If we could go over, please, to page 7.  This 
is a page containing details of a licensing agreeme nt 
reached with the Monsanto Company.  We will again c ome 
back to some details of this, but I don't intend to  go 
through the fine detail of who had which rights.  B ut 
you will see there, sir, that by 1981, there is 
a fairly detailed explanation of the relationship 
between Speywood and Monsanto.  The crux of it is t hat 
Monsanto had licensed to Speywood the technique to use 
polyelectrolyte fractionation both in porcine and 
human plasma, and in return, Speywood had agreed to
certain limitations on its rights use the products
that resulted from them. 
Although that version of the licensing agreement 
dates from 15 August 1981, there was a previous 
agreement as well.
If we could now, Soumik, please, go to page 30 
of the document.  Under the heading "Management and
Staff" the report says: 
"At the time of our review, Speywood employed 
12 persons at Bingham [that's the Nottinghamshire 
site] and 21 at Wrexham." 
So we can see, sir, a much smaller company from  
8those that we have been dealing with in the recent 
days and weeks.
"The senior staff are:- 
"D Heath -- Managing director 
"P Lees -- Commercial director 
"D Williams -- Marketing director" 
And those names, David Heath, Peter Lees and 
David Williams will come up as we go through the 
presentation today.
Then, a few names down:
"Mrs S Middleton -- Chief Scientist"
That's Sarah Middleton who will be giving 
evidence later today.
If we could go back, please, Soumik to 
page 27 -- sorry, 26.  The bottom half of that page ,
please, under the heading "Share Capital".  The 
accountants set out the current position as of 1981  on 
the shares that were owned by the different equity 
holders in the company.  I will use the adjusted 
figures, and we can see that an investment trust ow ns 
32,000 shares, so that's about 40 per cent of the 
company. 
A finance body owns a further 21,200 shares, so 
that's about 26.5 per cent of the company.  Mr Heat h 
owns 18,800 shares, that's 23.5 per cent.  So that' s                                   
 
                             about roughly a quarter of the company.  And Mr Lee s 
and Mr Williams have about 5 per cent of the compan y 
each.  So those are the equity holders. 
I merely note that Sarah Middleton is not one of 
the equity holders.  She was the chief scientist an d 
hence an employee of the company. 
Thank you, Soumik.  We can take that down now. 
The proposed investment of £4 million was in 
fact made in 1982 by Prutec and the National 
Enterprise Board.  Both of those entities took 25 p er 
cent of the equity of the company, meaning that the  50 
per cent that was left remained in the hands of the
original investors, presumably according to the sam e 
proportions. 
After that investment, a new chairman, 
Mr Seymour, was appointed, and Mr James Mottram bec ame 
the general manager in 1983.  His brief, according to 
the documents that we have, was to, and I quote,
"reorganise Speywood into a classical UK 
pharmaceutical company".  The reference for that is
IPSN0000166_019.  Mr Heath and Mr Williams 
subsequently left the company and we will hear 
a little evidence about the circumstances in which 
that took place, and the disputes that gave rise to
it. 
10 In 1984, the company was acquired by Porton 
International.  It was later acquired by 
Ipsen Biopharm Limited. 
Just for your note, Ms Middleton, from whom we 
will hear later, left the company in 1984, just bef ore 
it was acquired by Porton. 
Turning then to the importation and sale of 
factor concentrates.  As we heard yesterday, there was 
an agreement, a distribution agreement, between 
Speywood Laboratories and Cutter Laboratories, so t hat 
Speywood could import and sell within the UK the 
Factor VIII product, Koate.  The agreement itself i s 
at IPSN0000139_003.  It ran for three years from 
June 1976. 
I won't take you to the agreement, sir, but it 
is there for future consideration should that be 
necessary. 
A product licence, PL 0370/0004, was granted to 
Speywood for Koate in August 1976.  The reference 
I have for that is IPSN0000312_036.  We know, and a s 
we heard yesterday, that Cutter had originally 
submitted an application for Koate, but Speywood in
effect took this on.  There is correspondence to th at 
effect, which is BAYP0000020_046. 
Unfortunately, sir, we don't have at present the  
11 documents that will help to answer the questions th at 
we raised yesterday about the level of detail that was 
provided before the licence was granted, to what 
extent further information was provided about the 
source of plasma and the way in which donors were 
selected and indeed rejected.  That is something we
will continue to explore.  We will seek to work wit h 
others within the Inquiry, as well, to see if they can 
shed any light on it.  But, at present, I'm afraid,
I can't take that story any further. 
We know that there was some further 
correspondence about packaging and the hepatitis 
warning in October 1976, a reference is 
IPSN0000312_040.  The warning itself -- and perhaps  we 
could bring this up, Soumik -- is at IPSN0000329_00 1.
Here we can see the data sheet for Koate.  The 
product licence is there on the left-hand side.  Th e 
address of Speywood and, of note, sir, is that the 
address given is the Bingham address, the Nottingha m 
address, and not the Wrexham address.  There may be
a significance to that as we go through. 
If we could -- give me one second, Soumik. 
If we could go to the second page, please, the 
"Contra-indications and warnings", it says: 
"There are no known contra-indications to Koate.  
12 "Hepatitis  -- Koate is prepared from units of 
human plasma, each donation offer which has been fo und 
non-reactive for hepatitis B antigen ... when teste d 
by radioimmunoassay.  In addition, each batch has a lso 
been tested against hepatitis by radioimmunoassay.
However, despite these tests and the precautions ta ken 
in selecting donors, the risk of transmitting serum
hepatitis cannot be excluded." 
Thank you, Soumik. 
The product was on sale from Speywood from 
1 November 1976.  Reference for that is 
IPSN0000312_038. 
We have some sales figures from November 1976 to 
October 1977, and please can we have this on screen , 
please, Soumik, IPSN0000146. 
Very helpfully set out per haemophilia centre 
with a grand total at the bottom.  We can see that 
we're not entirely comparing like with like because
the -- some of the centres have been using the prod uct 
for longer than others.  Bristol has been using it for 
a full 12 months, compared to St Thomas's just usin g 
it for five. 
More than 500,000 units, and I take that to mean 
international units, had been sold to Oxford.  Then
about just over 300,000 units to Liverpool.                                  
 
                             3 If we go down to the bottom Soumik, we can see 
that the total sales for that period, November '76 to 
October '77, a 12-month period, is 2.7 million unit s. 
Those sales, sir, were achieved despite not 
tendering for the NHS central contract that we have
seen in some of the other presentations.  We will 
return to this matter and, indeed, the reasons why 
Speywood didn't tender to that contract when we com e 
back to look at some of the evidence from civil 
servants and Government ministers. 
A reference, so that we have it for when we come 
back, is DHSC0003719_098, which explains Speywood's
thinking at that time. 
David Williams, the marketing director, one of 
the names that we saw in the accountant's report, m et 
with leading haemophilia clinicians between 
August 1978 and January 1979 to discuss their facto r 
concentrate usage, and the Inquiry has considered s ome 
of the notes that he made of those meetings when 
examining each of the centres, so I won't take you 
through each one but they're helpful ways of gettin g 
a snapshot of what the Centre was doing at the time . 
I will, however, just highlight one, for present 
purposes, which is IPSN0000334_019.  We can see fro m 
the file note that this is Mr Williams's meeting wi th  
14 Professor Bloom at the University Hospital of Wales  on 
24 August 1978. 
I'm going to read through all of this note, sir. 
There will be some things that I focus on now, whic h 
are to do with the product sales, and some things t hat 
I will come back to in due course which in particul ar 
concerns polyelectrolyte fractionation.  The initia ls 
"PE", as we will see on this note, refer to 
polyelectrolyte fractionation. 
What Mr Williams said in the note is this: 
"There are 250 haemophiliacs attached to this 
centre, of which 100 are regular attenders and 13 
inhibitors.  Until recently, human factor VIII 
purchases have been split three ways, Hemofil, 
Factorate and Elstree.  They have now stopped using
Armour, following the hepatitis problem." 
I just pause there to note that, although it's 
not clear from this document, that may relate to 
reports in 1977 and 1978 of adverse reactions and 
hepatitis infection through the use of the Armour 
product. 
"Prices are: Hemofil 11p and Factorate 9.5p." 
Factorate being the Armour product. 
"Bloom used to favour Immuno, but as this is now 
16p, he never buys. 
15 "He is not interested in the administration kits 
but prefers to make his own up in the hospital. 
"I offered Koate at 10p for 50,000 unit lots and 
am reasonably confident that we will get some of th e 
business.  Bloom always likes to keep two suppliers ,
but is reluctant to make frequent changes. 
"Bloom is obviously not an animal lover although 
he is interested in our work." 
Pause there, sir.  A slightly cryptic reference, 
I believe, to porcine Factor VIII.
"He is prepared to look at the new material when 
available.  He referred to Rizza's suggestion that use 
of porcine increased the inhibitor level to human.  He 
also felt that the present material was too antigen ic 
and expressed doubts as to the likelihood of our 
reducing this to a level which he would regard as 
satisfactory.  I think it important that we provide
him with clinical evidence as soon as possible. 
Perhaps Jean Pierre could prepare some notes." 
I pause there, sir, to say that we will be 
coming back to this, but Professor Bloom's reaction  to 
the possible use of porcine Factor VIII is, I would
suggest, fairly typical of the view at that time in
1978, and we will come on to see how that view chan ged 
or, indeed, whether it changed, in due course.  
16 "Bloom would like some PE to help with new 
research project of his looking at the biochemistry  of 
human factor VIII.  He has a research worker starti ng 
January 1979, to work full time on this subject.  W e 
could arrange to have first option on the results. 
"PPF was at one time rationed in his area, but 
is now issued on a first come, first served basis. 
There is never enough available, partly because the
Health Service does not produce sufficient, partly 
because of the high price.  Bloom felt that there w as 
a place for commercial material, if it could be 
produced more cheaply.  We should obviously 
investigate." 
The date of the note is 31 August 1978 and we 
can see at the bottom that it was copied to Mr Heat h. 
As I say, sir, there are a number of other 
similar notes.  I'm going to be give some reference s 
for the transcript so that people have those in cas e 
they are of use to them.  I would point out that in
one of them, which concerns Dr Stewart at Birmingha m, 
he says that he hadn't heard about any hepatitis 
problem in connection with the Armour product.
That is IPSN0000333_022. 
The other references are IPSN0000332_021, 
IPSN0000334_019, IPSN0000331_008, IPSN0000333_022,                                   
 
                             7 IPSN0000338_011 and IPSN0000321_026. 
The prices that were offered to the various 
clinicians varied.  Some of that variation is due t o 
different amounts of product being offered.  As you
observed the other day, sir, there is generally 
a discount for bulk.  However, there is also 
an attempt to negotiate with individual clinicians to 
try to get their business, in essence. 
As we've seen in that letter, 10p was offered to 
Professor Bloom; 9.5p for 1 million international 
units was offered to Dr Kernoff at the Royal Free i n 
January 1979; 9p was offered in a draft letter, 
seemingly to the whole Haemophilia Centre Directors , 
dated 1980.  The reference for that is 
IPSN0000325_001.
Dr Preston was offered 9.25p in August 1979 and 
8.5p by May 1980.  The reference is IPSN0000322_006 , 
and the same stem, _003.
The pattern, which you will have observed, sir,
is generally a falling one. 
In December 1979, an issue arose about the 
potency claimed for Koate on its labelling. 
What appears to have happen is that, when the 
product was tested by NIBSC and by the individual 
Haemophilia Centres, they found that their assays d id  
18 not accord with the potency that was stated on the 
label.  If we could go, please, Soumik, to 
IPSN0000575, we will see some of the correspondence
about this.  The date is 4 December 1979, and the 
letter is going from David Williams to Mr C Jones o f 
Cutter Laboratories.  As we will see it's not only 
raising the problem but also raising the point that
Speywood would like compensation from Cutter for th e 
difficulties and the financial difficulties that th e 
problem had given rise to. 
What Mr Williams says in the letter is that the: 
"... situation with respect to [as he terms 
them] 'suspect' batches of Koate is as follows ..."
We can see there four batches listed down, and 
we can see, in the second column, the assigned 
potency, which I take to mean the potency that was 
stated on the label. 
You can also see the quantity received, the 
current stock and how much had been sold. 
The paragraph below, Mr Williams says: 
"As you will realise from the quantity involved, 
we have a major problem.  On the one hand, we are 
desperately short of 'good' stock and, clearly, we 
dare not sell new batches without first obtaining N IBS 
clearance.  So your urgent help with prompt despatc hes  
19 is of paramount importance.  The other side of the 
coin is that we have two major and influential 
customers, Oxford and Newcastle, reluctant to trust
our assay figures and insisting on their own check 
prior to acceptance." 
He gives some further detail on each of the 
batches. 
The first batch, C 1090, if we look back at the 
table we can see that its assigned potency was 1,10 0. 
Mr Williams, in his letter, says that C 1090 was: 
"Not acceptable to NIBS unless we re-label at 
900 my own view is that this should be returned to 
US
--Result #401--
" 
So NIBS has run its tests, found that the 
potency figure that they can obtain using their tes ts 
is around 900, and are insisting that the product i s 
re-labelled to show that potency, if it is to be so ld 
in the UK.  This is an example, sir, of the stop 
orders that we have heard made reference to.  The 
suggestion from Mr Williams is that that product 
should be sent back to Cutter and, presumably,
Speywood would be compensated for the cost of it. 
The second lot considered is NC 8610, which: 
"... has been extensively used in Oxford and 
Newcastle and is the subject of an attached letter  
20 from Rizza and Jones."
We don't have that letter. 
"NIBS obtained 210 and cleared at 230.  Repeat 
assays at Oxford indicate 185." 
What I take that to mean, sir, is that when 
NIBS -- the assigned potency, as we can see from th e 
table on the previous page, is 230.  NIBS in their 
tests obtained 210, the units don't matter but 
a figure of 210 for the potency, so about 10 per ce nt 
below that which was claimed.  I read that as meani ng 
that NIBS were content to clear the product as sayi ng 
that it had a potency of 230, presumably allowing s ome 
leeway for a potential difference in testing. 
But when the product was then tested at Oxford, 
the potency was 185, which appears to have prompted
a complaint to Speywood about the product. 
Mr Williams goes on to say that: 
"For the present, I have supplied replacement 
material free of charge to both centres.  Probably the 
simple way out financially, is to give them units 
equivalent to their 'loss', say 20% or 126,000 unit s. 
Obviously we will be looking to Cutter for 
compensation." 
So the fact that the product is not as potent as 
claimed means that more will have to be used, hence                                  
 
                             1 that figure of 20 per cent.  They will build up the
stockpile to replace that which these centres shoul d 
have had.  And as is stated in terms there, Speywoo d 
are looking to Cutter for compensation on that.  So
Speywood very much seeing this as a problem of 
Cutter's making. 
"NC 8185 
"This was cleared by NIBS at label declaration,
although their assay was around 10% low." 
Again, sir, showing that there is a degree of 
leeway allowed by NIBSC.  But as we can see from 
"NC 8184": 
"NIBS again got 900 and will not clear without 
re-label."
The claimed potency was 1130. 
So the leeway only extends so far before NIBS, 
using stop orders, say: you can't distribute this 
product without re-labelling it. 
What Mr Williams says about that product is: 
"I originally stated that we would [re]sell to 
France at label strength and in fact we have sold t hem 
200,010 units.  However, in view of total problem,
I feel it is not sensible to continue this policy."
I would say there is a further document, sir, at 
IPSN0000291, which is dated 21 February 1980, which 
22 shows that, after further thought, Speywood had 
decided not to sell product to France when NIBS has
said that it must be re-labelled.  And one of the 
reasons that is given for that policy is that Dunca n 
Thomas of NIBSC is in regular contact with his Fren ch 
opposite number and it would be embarrassing for th e 
companies involved to be found to be selling with o ne 
label in one country and one label in the other 
country.  Although I should add that it's important  to 
note that in his letter of 21 February 1980, 
Mr Williams also refers to a basic moral issue that  is 
involved as well.  So it is not just a cynical atte mpt 
to avoid being caught. 
The further point made by Mr Williams in his 
letter of 4 December 1979, a little further down th e 
page, please -- thank you Soumik -- is: 
"Of course, any recommendations on these batches 
could change if your technical people can resolve t he 
matter with NIBS.  I do hope you can achieve an 
agreement quickly." 
So there is some thought that this may be 
a technical issue perhaps about how the different 
tests work. 
Thank you, Soumik.  We can take that down. 
I leave that there, sir.  It is an example of  
23 the way in which the licensing system works its way
through at different levels. 
Turning to the switch of products from Koate to 
Humanate.  The June 1976 distribution agreement 
between Cutter and Speywood ran for three years, an d 
it appears that it was terminated at the end of 197 9. 
Cutter then began supplying Koate directly to the U K 
market.  We heard something about that yesterday. 
The references are IPSN0000331_001, and 
MHRA0036365_018. 
In February 1980, Speywood obtained a variation 
to their product licence allowing them to continue 
selling Koate for up to one year, and also allowing
them to import unlicensed -- sorry, to import 
unlabelled factor concentrate manufactured by Cutte r 
for relabelling and for sale under the name Humanat e. 
I'm afraid, sir, that we don't have the 
documents that accompanied that licence variation 
application, or at least we haven't identified them  if 
we do have them.  Our information is taken from 
a later licensing issue, which we will come on to. 
The reference is MHRA0036365_018. 

--Result #402--

But I think that doesn't give any sense of the injustice
of the issue
.  
That suggests 
the 
issue 
is 
financial
support for those who have an illness, rather than
compensation for unfair treatment.

--Result #403--

I don't know whether I would have been able to 
--
 I'm
sure Mike told me those are the three 
things
 that needed
to happen, whether I would have remembered that
 
43
five
 years on when I became Health Secretary
, 
I doubt.
I don't believe I 
saw
 this letter
, 
and I think it's 
--
this is not to excuse what I'm sure was yet another
response where the Government refused to take action,
but I think the context would be that ministers get
letters from campaign groups the whole time saying that
this or that needs to happen, often because of
an
 
injustice.
Indeed, you know, we received lots of over the
Mid Staffs situation
, 
which led to my predecessor
Andrew Lansley setting up the Public Inquiry into
Mid Staffs
.
What I think is apparent from this letter and the
previous briefing that you showed was given presumably
to Anna Soubry
, 
as the minister responsible from that
area, is that the Government didn't have a
 -- 
or the
State, is 
perhaps a more accurate phrase, including the
Civil Service
, 
didn't have an
 
open mind to this issue
.
They basically had decided that the State in the 1970s
and 
'80s
 had done the best it could in the
circumstances
: 
a very sad thing had happened
;
compensation had been put in place
; 
matter closed.
And I don't think -- the fact that none of that
reached the briefing that would have been seen by
Anna Soubry suggests exactly the kind of institutional
 
44
closing of ranks, which I think would have probably
happened in stages.  I think immediately after it
happened, people who were close to the issues might have
thought
, "
Well,
 perhaps a mistake was made.  Perhaps we
shouldn't have done that.  Perhaps we should have
informed people
"
.
But then I think the next set of thoughts may 
well
have been
 -- 
obviously
, 
I don't know this but I'm
speculating
, 
because I think it happened in other areas,
many, many other areas -- the next set of thoughts were
,
"
Yes,
 but these were all good people trying to do their
best
", 
and, you know, in those circumstances, we just
need to recognise that it wasn't an easy decision.
And then the next stage in thinking, which I think
is the most flawed of all, but I think may 
well
 have
been
 -- 
I can't say if it was in this case, but was
definitely present in many other areas
 -- 
was: 
yes
, we
were giving it to 2,000 people
, 
and 50 of them were
being infected every year
, 
but it was the greatest good
of the greatest number and we were helping 1
,
950 people
and
, 
to me
, 
that is fundamentally against what the NHS
should stand for, which is the highest standards of
safety and care to every single person
, 
as if 
they
 were
your own mother, father, son or daughter.
But I think that you can see that thought process
 

27 July 2022
          
          

  45
happening in a lot of areas where there were terrible
breaches of patient safety, you know, because it is true
that 
no
 one is trying to do the wrong thing or -- of
course
, 
there are one or two bad apples in a system as
large as the NHS
 
but
, 
by and large, 
no
 one is trying to
do the wrong thing.  And then what happens is people
think
, "
Well
, you know, we need to protect those people
who are trying to do the right thing
"
.
And then 
once
 you get 
five
 years on, 
ten
 years on,
people forget that there was even a moral dilemma, and
the 
account
 of history changes.  So I don't think the
officials who wrote that briefing to Anna Soubry would
have probably had any understanding of what happened.
One might hope -- and that, by the way, was why
Andy Burnham, who I know has given evidence, was advised
not to meet the Mid Staffs relatives, and something that
they are angry about to this day
, 
and I'm sure in
retrospect
 
he wishes that he had
, 
but officials said
"
No,
 it's not a good use of your time and you'll get
drawn into it
".  
It's why, by the way, in a completely different
context, when I became Foreign Secretary, I was
initially advised by the Foreign Office not to meet
Richard Ratcliffe
, 
the husband of
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe
, 
because there was a lot
 
of
 
46
suspicion about how he might try and use the meeting
.
So I am afraid that institutions and the State close
ranks 
around a lie, sometimes
, 
and I think that's what
has 
happen
ed
 in this case
.

--Result #404--

If we then go to a submission a little later in 2013,
July 2013, WITN3499010.  It's a submission from
Ben Cole, it's dated 11 July 2013
, 
and we can see it's
addressed both to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of
State for Public Health and to you.  Then the first
paragraph says:
"Following your 15 May meeting with officials to
discuss the HIV and hepatitis C contaminated blood
payment schemes, you requested advice on replacing the
current system with a no fault Quantum damages-based
compensation scheme.  You also asked for advice on
a tariff-based system.  Since then, 
[Secretary of State]
has also asked for advice on a system of equal sized
annual payments for all infected people, rising
incrementally to 
[
£25,000 
per annum]
.  This submission
sets out our preliminary assessment of these options, to
date."
Just pausing there, this would indicate that you
had
, 
yourself
, 
had some direct involvement with this
issue by this time?

--Result #405--

"Although never described by DH as compensation
, 
the
system is clearly compensatory in nature.  Some payments
appear to be made in recognition of the fact of
infection
, 
while others provide ongoing support, or to
compensate for loss.  Payment levels are for the most
part arbitrary, and, with some exceptions, not based on
any assessment of impact or need
.  
As a
 
result
, 
there is
scope for establishing a more coherent and rational
basis for the system, which would serve as the basis for
more effective targeting of spending."
Based on your own knowledge over the years you
were Secretary of State, would you agree with that
description: payment levels being
 "
for the most part
,
arbitrary
, 
and
, 
with some exceptions
, 
not based on any
 

27 July 2022

assessment of impact or need
"
?

--Result #406--

Then paragraph 3 sets out how a proposal to HMT could be
formulated.  I don't, I think, at this stage, think
I need to go 
through 
the detail of the options because
,
again
, 
the options change, I think
, 
to some extent, from
document to document.  But I want to pick it up with
a letter that you wrote
 
then
, 
at the end of this month
,
to the Prime Minister.
So that's 
C
ABO0000163_003.  It's a letter dated
30 June 2015 from you to Mr Cameron, and we can see it's
headed, if we go further down the page, Lawrence
"Response to the Penrose report
", 
and you say this:
"As you know this is an
 
incredibly difficult issue
where we are committed to giving a full government
response 
by
 
the
 end of July.  It is basically impossible
to bridge the gap between the expectations of families
who have suffered and are expecting a settlement
exceeding £1 
[
billion
]
 and what we can realistically
afford.
"Time is also pressing as we currently face
litigation from 
3 
Hepatitis C sufferers
, 
or former
sufferers
, 
who are making the case that the current
arrangements favour HIV 
sufferers 
over 
those 
with Hep C.
 
83
Legal advice is that some are likely to succeed
, 
and if
the DH were ordered to recompense them, we would face
a multimillion pound liability for compensation for them
and others in similar circumstances.
"After 
considerable thought I am writing to set
out what I believe our options 
are
 ...
"
Then we have three options set out.  I just want
to read parts of this, because this is obviously a point
at which you are directly involved in the
decision-making process.

--Result #407--

I suspect that is compensation to families who have lost
loved ones rather than payments to support people who
are currently ill
.

--Result #408--

Well, um, he took a political judgment.  He may 
well
have been right.  I took a slightly different judgment
because
, 
within the 125 million
, 
I wanted to prioritise
treatment and make sure that everyone who had hep C got
treatment really quickly.  So we made a different
judgment in that situation.  I understand why he made
the judgment he made and I think he is right that there
would have been a lot of opposition from the families
that didn't get the compensation that they were
expecting
.
So, you know, for me, the important thing about
this response was that he understood that it would be
harsh 
beyond belief to stick with the 25 million and
that we should
, 
as a very minimum
, 
do the 100 million.
It was also clear that he agreed the national
finances couldn't find the 480 million
, 
which obviously
,
from a Health Secretary's point of view
, would 
have been
what I would have hope
d
 would have happened, but those
 
96
were the constraints that I was operating under.

--Result #409--

  
Mr Hunt, picking 
things
 up at the end of 2015,
your statement tells us that in December 2015 there was
the announcement of the public consultation on the
reform of the schemes.  You've set out the timetable in
your statement, I don't think 
we
 need to go to the
underlying documents but
, 
just in terms of dates, the
consultation ran between January and April 2016 and then
the results of the consultation and the Government
response were 
published 
in July 2016
.
I just want to pick up couple of documents arising
out of those events.  The first is at WITN3903006.  If
we go to the second page, we can see it's another minute
from Clare MacDonald to the Prime Minister
, 
dated
5
 
July 2016.  Then it refers to the introduction of the
new scheme
, 
and it says in the first bold paragraph:
"The Department of Health are ready to announce
a new,
 more 
generous
, 
compensation scheme for people
infect with contaminated NHS blood products.  
The
 
102
details are set out in this note for your agreement.  If
you would like to announce this 
£
125m of new investment
,
you could do so at PMQs on 20 July
, 
or DH could put this
out themselves more quietly."
Then
, 
I don't think I need to go through the
detail of it
, 
but there is a description of main
features of the new scheme.
If we just go to the top of the page, and just
look at the handwriting from Mr Cameron again.  I'm not
quite sure what the first word is
.

--Result #410--

Yes,
 it took 
too
 long.  And I think when you look at the
anguish 
that families were facing, but 
actually,
 the
simple fact that people were dying without getting
access to the additional compensation for their families
or support that they needed with their lives
, 
I don't
think anyone can be proud of the performance of the
British state over the last 25 years, but during the
period I was in office, and this is not to excuse it,
but the bottom line was that there was a big financial
issue, and we had a huge national deficit, and so, you
know, it was like we were trying really hard to do
something but we just didn't have the -- I'm talking
about it from the Department of Health's point of view,
 
115
we didn't have the ability to do it.  And as someone who
cared a lot of patient safety issues, I was able to, you
know, commission a second Francis report after
Mid Staffs
, 
a report into Morecambe Bay, the Ockenden
report
 into Shrewsbury and Telford
, 
the Gosport report,
and I was able to make progress in a number of other
areas, but 
it
 was immensely frustrating that in this
area
, 
because the quantum of money 
involved 
was billions
not hundreds of millions, and I just didn't have that at
my disposal, progress was -- I think you could only
describe it as painfully, painfully slow
.

--Result #411--

Can I turn to consider the question of a public inquiry,
and pick that up in your statement.  So if we could go
back
 to WITN3499001
, 
and if we could go to page 5,
please.  
In 
paragraph 0.4 at the bottom of the page, you
say this:
"When I did 
become
 Health Secretary it 
was
 made
clear to me that the Treasury would not support
an
 
inquiry because of the potential cost to the taxpayer
 
116
which (taking into 
account
 any decisions on financial
support which might follow, such as 
a 
recommendation for
a compensation scheme similar to that in place in
Ireland) could amount to billions of pounds.  I did not
therefore pursue the issue and follow
ed 
the official
government 'line' in correspondence with all
campaigners."
Can you help us in understanding who made it clear
to you that the Treasury would not support an
 
inquiry
?

--Result #412--

Well, basically
, 
I knew
 -- 
and Number 10 and Number 11
knew
 -- 
that the public inquiry would be likely to
recommend large sums of money, compensation, support for
 

27 July 2022
          
          

  117
families
, 
that would have to be funded centrally, not
from the Department's budget 
and 
the NHS's budget.
So that was why
 -- 
because of the independence of
an
 
inquiry, the power of an
 
inquiry is that
 -- 
you know,
as you are very well aware, the power of an
 
inquiry is
that it's very difficult in practice for a Government to
reject any recommendations that are made by a public
inquiry.  It does it in enormous 
detail
, as you're
doing
, 
and its recommendations have tremendous moral
authority
.
So I think everyone understood that if there was
a public inquiry
 
and it made a recommendation of, you
know, whatever the compensation was, that would have to
be funded by the Treasury.  And
 
so
, 
therefore
, 
it was
clear to me that Number 10 and the Treasury would not
support a public inquiry.
But I felt, as I've said to you before, that there
was
 a very big injustice
, 
so I was looking out, if you
like, for when a moment might come that that position
might change and it did come, and we're going to go on
to talk about that
.

--Result #413--

Then I think we can get a sense of the Government line
that was then promulgated on the issue of a public
inquiry in communications with campaigners and
individuals
 
from DHSC6736736.
Now
, 
this is not a response from you; it's
a response that's been provided on your behalf and I'm
afraid this is -- looks like a draft letter
, 
so it
doesn't look as though we can be clear 
as
 
to
 who it's
from.  But we can see from the first paragraph somebody
,
in any event
, 
is replying on your behalf and it looks
like we're dealing with late 2012.  The third paragraph
says this:
"As I expect you know, it has been the view of
successive governments that
 
after all this time there is
no
 justification for a public inquiry into the matters
relating to NHS supplied contaminated blood or blood
products in England.  The relevant facts are already in
 
119
the 
public
 domain."
Then reference is being made to documents being
published in line with the Freedom of Information Act
.
Now
, 
it might be said
, 
Mr
 
Hunt
, 
that that line,
and we've seen it in earlier documents and we'll see it
in later documents, was disingenuous because
, 
from what
you said
, 
the real reason for not holding a public
inquiry was the concern that it might lead to
recommendations for the payment of compensation
, 
which
the Government didn't want to have to find.

--Result #414--

I'm not trying to defend that line.  It's wrong
, 
and
that is the kind of groupthink that was in the
Government that basically said that this scandal
happened because, you know, good people were trying to
do their best, something terrible happened, it wasn't
anyone's individual fault, and
 -- 
you know, and
therefore when it comes to compensation the matter is
closed.
That was the view of successive governments and
indeed 
we
 didn't have any reason to think that some of
the stories that we've heard subsequently, that clear
evidence that people were being infected was overlooked
by key people at the time in the 1970s and 
'80s
.
I felt that
, 
irrespective of whether people had
been deliberately infected, more compensation should be
 
120
paid because this was a terrible thing that had
happened, and it was an
 
injustice in its own right.  So
that was my basis for wanting to see if there were ways
that we could get more compensation and more support to
the families but that
 
is
, 
I suppose
, 
the legal line,
that because -- 
and my own belief -- and you're going to
come to this conclusion
, your
 Inquiry
, 
is that it is
wrong
 -- 
but my own belief is that it's not correct but
it was the 
public
 line and I didn't have any reason not
to -- I didn't have any reason to deviate from that
.
And
, 
indeed, I was 
obliged
 to follow collective
responsibility as a Health Secretary
, 
even though, as
you know, I personally felt that we needed to do more.

--Result #415--

Well, I don't think that -- that paragraph was written
by officials, and I don't think it's -- I mean
,
ministers have to take responsibility for everything
that happens in their Department
, 
so I would never blame
an
y 
individual for that
, 
but I don't think it's a very
 
127
accurate representation of what the real score was.
I think it is true to say that there is always
a risk, in an
 
inquiry, in a public inquiry, that the
Government can use a public inquiry to kick issues into
the long grass because they take several years.  And so
it is a reasonable point to make that there is a risk in
a public inquiry that this happens, although in this
Inquiry, you know, I know that you are considering
whether you make recommendations for interim payments
and Sir Robert Francis has published his views on that
.
So it doesn't have to be the case but there is a risk of
that
.
So it's not wrong to say that, but I think the
real reason why the Department of Health's position was
against a public inquiry was because they thought that
the costs of any compensation that was decided by
a public inquiry would have to be met from the NHS's
budget and that was the heart of it.

--Result #416--

Do you know whether an
 
exercise has ever been done of
anyone 
working
 out how much could have been saved
ultimately if a proper scheme of compensation had been
established in the late 
'80s
 or early 
'90s
?

--Result #417--

Then if I could then draw your attention to a report of
the Health and Social Care Committee
, 
RLIT0001282.  Now
,
this is a relatively recent 
report
, April 2022, of the
Committee
, 
which you talked about this morning which you
chair.  We can see it's entitled "NHS litigation
reform".  It's a fairly lengthy report and I'm not going
to ask you to comment on the bulk of it.  But one of the
themes that has emerged from the evidence that this
Inquiry has heard was a concern on the part of officials
and ministers not to provide financial support because
of what was seen as a slippery slope to no-fault
compensation.
That idea of no-fault compensation or compensating
people outside of court actions for clinical negligence
is one of the central issues in this report.  Can you
just tell us in a nutshell what the conclusions were of
the Committee in the report?

--Result #418--

Yes
, and by the way, we're not the first people to make
this recommendation.  I think Sir Brian is very familiar
with the approach that we took from his own work on the
Bristol Inquiry.  But I think there is a crossover in
,
 
148
a way
, 
to the issues you're considering here.
So the example that we give here is that if a baby
is born severely disabled, at the moment under the
law
 -- 
maybe the child has cerebral palsy because of
errors made in the birthing process
 -- 
the only way that
the family can get compensation is if they can prove
clinical negligence
, 
either by the clinicians involved
or by the hospital.
And of course, they desperately need that
compensation because they've got a disabled child to
bring up, and it's
 -- 
you know, that child will have
a lot of needs.  And so you end up with a legal process
that can last between five and 
ten
 years
 
and, you know,
then they might get a multimillion
-
pound settlement but
they didn't get the money when they needed it most
,
which was in the early years
.  
And the doctors are incredibly defensive in the
process, because 
no
 doctor wants to be accused or
convicted of clinical negligence, and the one thing that
used to happen most of all, which is to 
actually
understand why it happened
 -- 
because 
no
 doctor would do
this on purpose
 -- 
learn the lessons, change the
procedures
 
and spread the lessons around the rest of the
NHS
, 
is the thing that doesn't really happen
.  
And in
Japan, which is one of the examples 
we
 used in this,
 

27 July 2022

they introduced no-fault compensation for children born
with severe cerebral palsy in 2008 or 2009, and they
have had a one quarter reduction in children born with
severe cerebral palsy in that period
.
So it's immensely better, much, much cheaper
.  
And
I think the last comment I'd say on this is that
, 
when
I was Health Secretary, I was warned we can't have
no-fault compensation in the NHS because it would be 
too
expensive, because the vast majority of people who are
harmed by the NHS don't take the NHS to court but 
if
 you
just had automatic compensation from a menu and lots --
you'd end up paying money to lots of people who don't
currently get paid anything and that would end up
costing a lot.
To our astonishment when we did this report -- and
that's what they do in New Zealand -- when we looked at
what happens in New Zealand, as part of the research for
this report, we found that
,
 
actually
, it costs half as
much as the proportion of all the health spending in
New Zealand as it costs us in the NHS in England
.  
So it
is not only much better for patients because lessons are
learned but it's also much cheaper for the health
system.

Mr Hunt, this final set of questions won't be
 

27 July 2022
          
          

  153
in a particular chronological or thematic order because
they're specific points I've been asked to raise from
a number of different sources
.  
Could we go to, please, Lawrence
, 
DHSC0050028.
This is really just a potential point of correction to
a document.
We can
 see there's a date at the top of the 
page
,
7
 
July 2017 and I think that's the date that 
then,
perfectly 
understandably appears in your statement
.
If we go to page 3
, 
paragraph 13, we can see the
last bullet point refers to, on the 9
 
July, the
Sunday
 
Times publishing a letter to the Prime Minister
signed by the leaders of all opposition parties calling
for a public inquiry.
So I'm really asked just to point out that it may
be that the date of 7
 
July on this is inaccurate and it
might perhaps be 10 July.  It's obviously before the
announcement or the final decision that's taken.
So that's that.
We can take that down, thank you.
When I was asking you earlier about the decision
making as regards a public inquiry, you said that it was
the view, or the knowledge, that an
 
inquiry would
recommend large sums of money or compensation that was
deterrent factor.  Does it follow that there was
 
154
an
 
underlying acceptance within Number 10 and the
Department that an
 
inquiry would be likely to find that
there was wrongdoing, which would then point to
compensation?

--Result #420--

The Gosport, the Morecambe Bay, these were independent
inquiries but they weren't public inquiries.  And
compensation wasn't the principal issue.  In fact, you
know, I don't think it's the principal issue for people
here; I think it's justice, and the truth, that matters
most.
But nonetheless in this case there was 
a potential
for a large bill, as I think was evidenced by what
happened in Ireland, which I think was what was on the
minds of people when they were thinking about whether to
have a public inquiry with respect to the Contaminated
Blood Scandal.

--Result #421--

Then we can see the purpose there
:
"
To brief the Minister on the Haemophilia
Society's continuing campaign for compensation for
haemophiliacs infected with Hepatitis C as a result of
NHS treatment using blood or blood products."
I just want 
to -- 
if we can have the whole page,
I just want to flick through it with you.
So 
we can see page 1 sets out the background
.  
If
we go over to page 2
, 
that continues.  We can see at
paragraph 4 that it says there 
that 
the previous
administration rejected claims for 
such a
 no-fault
compensation
, 
then sets out the previous
administration's grounds for doing so
.
Then it continues down with more background
.
Then if we go over the page, it says at 7 how the
issue 
has
 
been
 dealt with on a UK-wide basis in the
past
.  
 
20
Then it makes a recommendation at paragraph 9
:
"
In light of the fact that the Department of
Health have rigorously examined this issue twice in
recent years
 
and that The Haemophilia Society have not
produced fresh evidence to support their claim for
financial assistance, we advise that a further
examination of this issue would only draw the same
conclusions previously reached.  We therefore recommend
that the Minister endorses the decision taken by her
predecessor and signs the attached reply."
Is this typical of the sort of briefings you were
getting
 
then, building on what you've told us about the
officials at that time?

--Result #422--

I can't in any detail
, 
in the sense that I can only tell
 
24
you what I have seen of those papers that have been made
available to me, coupled with
, 
obviously
, 
what I can
remember.  There will perhaps be other stages or steps
or, you know, other paper around.  I mean
, 
I can see
when I look through the paper
, 
there must be other
papers at that time.
But
, 
as I've set out
 
as best I could
 
in my written
statement, I've shared with you what my reaction was to
that paper.  And
, 
in truth, I wasn't sure how to
proceed.  I just didn't want to proceed in the way that
was recommended to me and
, 
on the one hand
, 
you could
say
 "
Well
, 
it's one letter to one MSP
", 
and we were
starting to get letters by the hundreds
, 
from not just
MSPs but from lots and lots of people and organisations
from right across the country
.  
So you could say
 "
It's
just one letter
", 
but
, 
of course
, 
the minute you as
a minister pen a response
, 
even to one letter
, 
you've
made a policy statement.
So I had a great anxiety about, you know, how to
respond to this.  And
, 
if it's appropriate, it's maybe
relevant 
for me at this stage, 
as I've said in my
written statement
, 
to just wind back slightly
, 
because
,
as an
 
issue
 -- 
and I'm talking about that moment in
time, not what I knew consequently and what I know
now
 -- 
but as an
 
issue, 
this
 had been around, if I can
 

29 July 2022
          
          

  25
put it in those terms, during the election campaign
,
alongside lots and lots and lots and lots of other
campaigning issues.
More MSPs were getting involved and interested 
and
The Haemophilia Society did a lot of very, very early
targeted campaigning and lobbying with the new
Parliament by the time I'd been appointed 
the
 Health
Minister
.  
So, you know, unlike during the election when
I'd been the 
education 
spokesperson in the campaign team
and very, very 
attuned 
to the debate that was taking
place 
in 
that part of the world, if you like
, 
I very
quickly adjusted to trying to pick up what some of the
priorities for 
members might be
.  
And it was clear that a number of members, you
know, were taking a very keen interest in the campaign
,
I think it would be fair to say
, 
with the exception of
a couple who 
had
 previously served in Westminster and
had had some involvement with the issue and with the
campaign previously
.  
I think many MSPs were at a very
early stage of, you know, really understanding what the
background in the history was, but they clearly were
seeing this as something that 
should
 be raised.
So all my i
n
stincts
 -- 
and I think in politics you
have to rely on 
your 
instincts a lot
, 
and I think in the
first year of devolution
 
many of us 
had
 to rely on them
 
26
a great deal -- all my instincts were certainly, as
I say, not to respond in the way that was suggested
.
But my other instincts
, 
and this also came from a lot of
wider
 life and work experience
, 
was also not
 
to do or
say anything precipitous
, 
because although I didn't know
what sat underneath all this I knew there was a lot that
did and a lot of sensitivities and a lot of complexity
.
And I think I'm right in saying
 -- 
and I say
 
in my
submission 
"
I think
"
, because this is the kind of detail
that
 
I
 
can't be precise on unless anybody shows me
anything to the contrary
 -- 
I think I just didn't
, 
for
a couple of weeks
, 
take a decision on that
, 
on
a response.  The version that you've put in front of me,
this is what enables me, I think, to be precise 
about
timing
, 
in a way
.  
Yes, 
I think the then Deputy Minister had seen it
which signals to me that I think I might have been out
of the office 
at 
that period
, 
because I think I spent
a lot of time in the early summer trying to use recess
to get out and visit different parts of the country
,
because we were very 
tied
 to Parliament prior to that
and tied to Edinburgh and
, 
of course
, 
the other thing we
wanted to do in the early days of devolution is show
this was not the Parliament for the central belt of
Scotland
, 
which was another significant issue
.
 
27
So I am guessing that I might not even have seen
that
 on the date that it was produced and I think I'm
right in saying I still 
hadn't
 decided how to respond,
and I'm sure it's probably sitting amongst a range of
other things that were requiring attention and maybe
I similarly 
hadn't 
taking decisions on, when there was
a subsequent submission
, 
which I've referred to in my
statement and which I suspect you may come on to, which
I think was dated 
8 
August.
So I don't know if you want me to turn to that now
but that was really the next time I had occasion to
formally consider
 
a submission related to the issue of
compensation for haemophiliacs with hepatitis C.

--Result #423--

I think that's at page 2.  This arises out of a BBC
e
nquiry
, 
because they're planning to run a story on
claims for compensation for haemophiliacs 
who have
contracted 
hepatitis C as a result of 
infected blood.
If we look at the bottom of page 2
, some background is
set out and then 
it says 
"
Lines to take
":
"We propose 
that the following 
line 
be given in
response to the enquiries
 from the BBC
 ...
"
If we go over the page we can see 
what is said
there:
"The actions taken by the NHS in Scotland in the
1980s to ensure the safety of blood products
administered 
to haemophiliacs do not suggest that there
was any negligence on the part of the health service
s,
given the state of knowledge at that time about
protection against Hepatitis C and the practical
difficulties of introducing a Hepatitis C
-safe
 product
any sooner in Scotland.
"
This suggests that compensation for this set of
patients, tragic as their case may be, would not 
be
 
30
appropriate, as compensation should 
only
 be paid where
the NHS 
or 
individuals working in it 
have 
been at fault
.
"
Of course it is open to the Scottish Parliament
to discuss the matter and the 
Executive 
would have no
objection to these issues being aired in debate if
Members so wish."

--Result #424--

Thank you
, 
and 
just 
to comment briefly on very much
a secondary matter, 
but, 
again
, 
like that first
submission
, 
to 
just 
give a sense of the prevailing
culture at that time, that last paragraph
 -- 
and again
I remember this, in a way that I don't necessarily
remember other things
 -- 
but that last paragraph of
saying, "Of course it is open to the Scottish Parliament
to discuss the matter and the Executive would have 
no
objection to these issues being aired in
 
debate if
members so wished", I mean
, 
it was inconceivable on any
issue that we could use that kind of language.
It was entirely up to the Parliament what they
debated and discussed.  It was not for 
us
 
to
 give
permission or say we'd have 
no
 objection
.
So
, 
just on a microcosm, that paragraph there,
I suppose, speaks to that wider change that we were
going through, but to go back to the importan
t
substantive issues, and obviously how 
they
 relate to
matters that we're discussing 
today
, I think what was
 
31
important for me with these two submissions
, 
and just to
illustrate the sort of starting point for the new
Executive
, 
was 
that
 on that 15 July submission, we have
a few pages that, you know, basically says
 "
This has all
been looked at
"
 -- the generality of the issue, the
totality of the issue of compensation for haemophiliacs
with hepatitis C and
, 
by extension, others infected
, 
and
so on
, 
that had all been looked at, it was all done and
there was 
no
 requirement for us to look at this any
further
, 
on the basis of couple of pages
.
Now what we had, and it's important to set out the
genesis
 of this, if you go to the beginning of this
paper
 --

--Result #425--

So if I could
 
again pu
t 
some context around this, by
that time, the work that I had kickstarted in a given
moment
, 
on a given day
, 
faced with a particular decision
about what to say publicly in this issue
 
that could
 

29 July 2022
          
          

  49
enable us to start to engage positively and practically
with such -- I say again
, 
complex and sensitive issue --
that piece of work
, 
as I say
, 
was started in August.
There is 
actually
 -- it's in amongst the papers
 --
there's correspondence at the early stage
 
and it all
seems bizarre 
actually
 looking at this now, but bearing
in mind that initially it was focused facts on
a specific issue, it was originally said that that could
be compiled within a month, and that was in the public
domain, that was there.
Having met with The Haemophilia Society in
September
 -- 
and I'm sorry I will come back to this
.
I know the specific point you're raising but I just want
to explain where this sits in the chronology, if that's
all right.
So we met with The Haemophilia Society in
September.  That then resulted in other questions being
raised, that resulted in other areas of 
en
quiry being
taken on board
.  
As I say, SNBTS met with
The Haemophilia Society -- or the representatives of
haemophilia groups in Scotland 
as
 
well
, I think, at that
time.  There was various discussions.
So the period was extended
 -- 
this was the point
.
The period was extended until December to allow
submissions
, 
whether from the Society or 
from
 
50
individuals
, 
and indeed from Haemophilia Centre
Directors I think
, 
you know, 
who 
were all feeding into
this process that was kind of growing by then
.  
So 
we
were then into the spring and in that period
 
there still
continued to be further strands of examination and
investigation
, 
and the submission
, 
which I know is in
amongst the Inquiry documents and I think is referred to
in my own statement
, 
the submission that The Haemophilia
Society made to this limited fact-finding exercise that
we
 had initiated, which I don't recall seeing fully at
the time, but I have seen submissions where certainly it
was referred to, it was a very full submission covering
the whole range of different issues that sat in that
whole debate about how to examine, how to address, how
to support, you know, people who had been affected by
infected blood and blood products across that whole
range of issues
.
So we were sitting with a limited piece of work
that was being done on a specific area, and all the
wider issues that had been raised not just in relation
to Scottish issues but, you know, UK matters 
too
.  So
the gap there was really significant.  So I remember
during that latter period
 -- 
and bear
 
in mind that we'd
said that we'd get something out on this fairly quickly,
we then had agreed to look at more things
 -- 
and
 
51
I remember getting very, very seized during that period
of the 
need
 for us to put parameters around what we
could
, 
at that point in time
, 
actually
 report on and
comment on
, 
because by that time
, 
too
, this was
definitely an issue that Parliament was going to look at
f
urther
 as 
well
, 
n
ot least because there had been two
petitions submitted through the new public petitions
process that was put in place when the Parliament came
into being
.
So the detail of that letter and the phrase that
you've read out to me, and like so many letters
 --
I know ministers always look at these things 
and 
think
,
"
Oh
, 
somebody else drafted this, it's not quite how
I would have put it if I'd had time to rewrite
everything
".  
But while the phraseology is not something
that
 
I would have initiated on myself, I think what we
were also going through there
, 
by then
, 
was a process of
trying to put some parameters around this initial range
of discussions and enquiries 
that 
we'd undertaken
, 
to be
able to put that out into the Parliamentary process for
further examination and further discussion.
It was crystal clear to me by that time that there
were just so many limitations of what we could 
actually
look at, address, enquire into
, 
and so on
, 
at our own
hand within -- not just
 within 
the Scottish Exec
, 
the
 
52
devolved Scottish Exec, I have to keep contextualising
this
 
within that very early period where we were trying
to do so much across so many different areas, and the
disconnect.  
Sometimes -- 
you know, I worked 
through
processes like this when I was a minister 
and I have
done before and since
 -- 
sometimes when you get in
a room with people and start to identify issues and
a problem
, 
you can work together and you can find a way
through
 
and
, 
on this occasion
, 
it was like we'd just
gone further and further apart, and it was really
difficult to think about how that could be b
r
ought back
together.
But there was going to be ongoing debate and
discussion so for us to put as much as we were able to
into that, and allow that discussion to continue,
I think was where we were.  And I'm sure we'll come on
to the issue of compensation
 
but
, 
by
 
then
, 
also, I had
clearly got more and more deeply into the background and
discussions on those issues 
too
, 
and so I knew that
I 
had to be clear about what we found around the issue
of the introduction of heat treatment and be public
about that
, 
because I'd committed to that
, 
but try to
find some other way of moving on that wider discussion
and range of issues.

--Result #426--

Well, as I say
, 
for my part, I was 
clear 
by that stage
we needed to draw a line through this work and be able
to pass something on
 
to 
the 
Parliament so that they
could start the process that they had committed to do
that was on hold.  So I think there was a-- I completely
understand the point they raise but I think there was
a very practical and pragmatic sense in my head that we
couldn't keep having more strands of -- adding more
strands of Inquiry on to something that started out very
focused and very fact based
, 
which was now starting to
move into highly contested areas, and would require far
more investigation than we had put in place.
So that's where I was coming from.  I think
 
and
I do 
feel
 it sits at the heart of so many 
of the 
issues
in 
the Inquiry
, 
and I've thought about this as I've
looked back through the papers from my time in office
.
You know, undoubtedly at that point in time, and the
advice that was repeatedly being given was
, "
We know
what happened
, we know what happened 
here
, 
so why look
any further?
"
 

29 July 2022
          
          

  57
I think what was possibly also confused and
conflated
, 
possibly even
, 
dare I say 
it, 
even in some of
the Parliamentary discussion
, 
was the question of the
past and 
the question of the present.  So I think, you
know, the present is the question of how you support and
potentially give financial support or compensation to
people now, and then the past
, 
of course
, 
is what
happened in the past
 
and then
, of course, 
by 
that stage
in time, the two had got so confused and conflated
 --
I think
 
in every part of the UK 
we
 were just stepping
into a part of it
 -- 
that I think that's what you see,
I think
, in 
a lot of that ambiguity.
And I'm sitting here now, and I've pored over
these documents, and thought through just where we were
as a devolved administration at the time and
reflected-on what I 
could/
should
/might 
have done
differently 
and 
better
, 
and there's always so much
.  
But
in that point in time, including what was often very
inadequate 
and, 
yes, ambiguous communication it was part
of what was coming through, and 
certainly as 
a minister
there was just limitations on how much you could drill
in, 
how much you could question, 
how much you could
amend, how much you could clarify, how much you could
change
.  
But I completely accept that the point that they
 
58
make and I think it is unclear and I think I had was
unclear for many of us at that time just what should be
looked at how it could be looked at and what questions
were still to be addressed because there was lots of
people around about saying
 "
Well
, 
that's closed, we know
that, that's done, why look at that?
"

--Result #427--

  
I asked you a question about public inquiries
before the break.  I said I'd come back 
to
 
it
 
but
, 
in
fact
, 
can we park that
?  
I'm going to park that little
a little bit later on and pick back up again with the
chronology with the internal investigation
.  
We were looking before the break at the terms of
 
60
reference, and what was going to be included and what
wasn't
 
and I'm going to go back a little in time now to
pick up a document from 
23 
September 1999,
 
so a few days
after that meeting with The Haemophilia Society.
SCGV0000170_152.  Again
, 
this is a document we've
looked
 
at in the hearing before.  It's an
 
email dated
23
 
September
, 
on behalf of the First Minister, to
a Mr Palmer
, 
and it says:
"The First Minister has seen your minute of
17
 
September to the Minister for Health outlining a way
forward following the meeting 
with
 
The
 Haemophilia
Society.  He was a little concerned about the possible
financial implications and fears that an
 
open mind could
be taken to mean an
 
open cheque
 
book.  He would be
grateful for information on the likely exposure if
compensation were to be awarded
.
"
Then if we scan back out, we can see there's two
lots of handwriting.  The one on the left appears to be
a sticky note
, 
and the one on the right, I think,
says -- I'm not sure what the first "SM" or
 
"
F
M
": 
"
Ms Deacon's office advises that this is very much
a PR exercise and there is unlikely to be any
compensation paid."
So
, 
first of all, is it right to understand from
this that this is
 -- 
at least if you 
hadn't
 seen the
 

29 July 2022
          
          

  61
email that's been 
sent
 by the First Minister, at least
the comments that he makes would have made their way to
you?

--Result #428--

Well, it looks to me -- 
no
 is the answer.  I don't know.
I'm pretty certain that the answer is no.  And the only
thing that I have absolutely
 -- 
or had visibility of, in
terms of anything that he 
saw
, would be, you know, where
we were having Cabinet discussions and so on about these
matters.  So anything else is conjecture, 
to
 
be
 
honest
.
And we weren't at that point in time, you know,
actually
 in the space of doing -- because I'm very
early on 
-- you know, in the space of 
actually
 thinking
about, you know, financial implications of -- we were
 --
rather
, 
we were leaning into the facts, the evidence,
the history, the issues, you know
, 
and that, I think,
would have 
actually
 come later
.  
Although I have seen
 --
only in papers that I've seen through the Inquiry
, you
know, I 
have seen that there were bits of discussion in
other bits of the office about, you know, what
compensation might involve
.  
But there was limited
compensation in that sense.
So I apologise, I 
feel
 in a number of these
answers
, you know, 
I'm giving you lots of different bits
of insight and so on
, 
but 
that -- 
that
 was 
what it was
like, really
, 
and that's what it's like now
, 
in terms of
 
71
me trying to retrospectively give you a picture of how
things worked.

--Result #429--

Yes
, sorry, about that
 period
 -- about the matters in
the report.
Then if we turn over the page to page 3 you say
this
 -- 
this 
is 
the
 second paragraph down:
"
'
Having studied all the facts
, 
I have concluded
that there is 
no
 evidence that the relevant authorities
did anything other than their best for patients
.  
As
a
 
result I do not believe
 
that the NHS should pay
compensation for non-negligent harm to those
haemophiliacs who contracted Hepatitis C during the
period covered by the report.
"'
When I announced this exercise I stressed that
we would
 -- 
as a new Executive
 -- 
take a fresh look at
the evidence
 
and we have done this.
"'
But we have seen 
no
 new 
evidence 
and nothing to
demonstrate that compensation is owed
'
."
I just want to ask you about that phrase that
you've used there, that the "
no
 evidence that the
relevant authorities did anything other than their best
for patients".  The Inquiry heard evidence from
Jeremy Hunt
 
MP this week about the way in which
institutions clos
e ranks
 after something has gone wrong.
And one of the ways in which he described what he 
was
calling as groupthink in that respect
 
was the stages
that the group thinking goes through.  And his second
 
86
stage
 -- 
and I'm not quoting directly from what he said,
I'm summarising it
 -- 
was that the thinking would be
that
 
these were good people trying to do their best, and
we just need to recognise that it wasn't an easy
decision.
Then the groupthink moves on to
: 
we need to
protect these people who were only trying to do their
best
.
Now, looking at the language that you have used or
has been attributed to you in this news release, do you
think, looking back, that the approach that
the
 
Department had to the investigation and to the
process that 
they
 went through may have involved some
element of that groupthink, of
, "
Well
, 
look, these were
good
 people trying to do the best they can, so therefore
we must protect them
"
?

--Result #430--

Undoubtedly, and I think in addition to that, and 
we
may -- I'm sure we probably will come on to this -- what
isn't yet apparent from the documents that we've
looked at so far in the timeline that we've covered, is
running in parallel with this 
relatively 
focused piece
of work and that 
process
 of opening up wider discussion
was a deepening or developing conversation, discussions,
discussions, about financial issues and compensation and
litigation
 
and
 
so
, 
in addition
, 
to the groupthink that
 
87
you've described, I think there was also a degree of
concern and defensiveness across the entire system, and
I
 -- 
you know, I think this has included us as
ministers, you know, about just where -- I use this
phrase again -- where we would go next and what the
costs and consequences might be
.
But that was not devoid of concern for
individuals.  In fact a lot of it
 -- 
and I do just want
to add this, I've hated some of the language, 
to
 
be
honest
, 
that's 
--
 especially when I 
re-
read papers from
Government back in
 -- back from 
that period
.  
You know,
it's language that's been around the Inquiry
, 
I know
,
about
 "
holding 
the
 line
" 
and what was affordable, and so
on.  It's so dehumanising
, 
it's horrible
, I mean -- 
but
what I do recall at that time was being desperately
concerned about a whole range of other needs -- and I'll
say needs, not even demands but needs -- that we were
seeing for different people that required health and
social care
, 
for different staff that needed to provide
health and social care
.
So if you had a 
parallel
 
bit 
of groupthink, if you
like, which was also about 
there's all this 
litigation,
there's 
all these things that 
we
 could be asked to pay
for, there's all these, you know, 
things 
that might come
down the track, then 
yeah
, I think -- I think that
 
88
combines to take you to 
a
 
particular place, which isn't
necessarily the right one.

--Result #431--

I would expect
, 
and I say this partly just from kind of
wider
 life and work, I would expect there to be an
element of groupthink 
in
 any organisation.  I would
certainly expect there to be a substantial amount of
groupthink in a very traditional arm of the British
Civil Service, if you like
.
And yet 
as 
I think
 -- 
as I've alluded to, but
albeit on much less significant issues, but 
it
 did apply
to significant issues 
too
, then 
yes
, I was conscious of
that across a range of different areas.  But I think
you're right: I think you see more of that, obviously
when you look through
 -- when
 you look back, than
necessarily you were able to see at the time
.
And the other thing I would want to say, just
 --
you know, I-- this particular news release, 
in
 that
particular moment in time -- and before I say it, can
I just say, there were a lot of things we managed to
achieve in those first couple of years, and do good
 

29 July 2022
          
          

  89
things and bring to fruition
.  
There are other things
that, you know, I look at now
 
and regard as so
inadequate in terms of the way they were done.  Not
deliberately, but they were
.  
They just were.
And the thing that I 
feel
 horrendous about to this
day is that -- leaving the report to one side and all of
that, because
, 
as I say, that was what it was in terms
of putting out there
 -- 
even leaving to one side
, 
and
unpopular I know this is, right, 
you know, 
that my own
views were 
hardened 
and I was under some pressure to say
something around that general compensation issue and so
on
, 
which is all woven up in here
, even leaving 
these
substantive points to one side
, 
I will always regret 
us,
and me in particular, not communicating better with the
people in Scotland that 
this
 affected.  We had 
become
far 
too
 reliant on, and ... 
well,
 we had -- we'd 
become
far 
too
 reliant on that access with The Haemophilia
Society as a campaigning organisation and that whole big
fight that was taking place across the UK, and had lost
sight of the human connection that we should have been
building.
And I'm pleased to say in other areas we did
successful
ly
 build that with people in Scotland that had
needs.
  But ...
So by the time this finally came out
 -- 
and 
to
 
be
 
90
honest
, 
it was one of the most horrible months of my
life
, 
for various reasons
, 
and probably one of the most
horrible months for the Executive as 
well
 --
Donald Dewar died
 -- I'm getting -- 
yeah
, I think just
in that period of time
.  
It all was mixed up even with
when we were able to publish the report
.  
The Executive,
you know, went into -- 
well
, 
it 
seriously impacted both
politically but emotionally even for, you know, for
people
.  
We went into a leadership contest as
a consequence
 
and
, 
as we see 
today
, 
leadership contests
aren't very good things.  It was 
a horrible
 period and
it's
, 
in my view
, 
a very suboptimal piece of
communication.  And as I say, that's taking it away from
the matters of substance.  But, you know, I also
 --
looking through the rearview mirror, if you like,
I understand all that was going on at the time, and that
doesn't make 
it
 right.
  So ...

--Result #432--

  
I'm going to pick it up 
now
 just before you left
office as minister, so we know from the papers and from
other witnesses that the Health and Community Care
Committee published its report on hepatitis C on
3
 
October
.  
We don't need to go to that but for the
transcript it's MACK0001929_001.
We looked at that yesterday, and 
the
recommendation 
that 
they made for a payment 
scheme
.
I just wanted to ask you about events very soon
before you 
left
 office.  So it seemed from the papers
that you'd formed a view a matter of days before leaving
off
ice 
that you would reject that recommendation made by
the Committee and look to appoint an
 
expert group to
look into the question generally about no-fault
compensation and specifically in relation to those
infected with hepatitis C from infected blood.
Now, I asked Mr Chisholm yesterday about the
decision that ultimately he made to advise the Cabinet
to reject that recommendation from the Committee and I'm
not going to ask you questions about that because that
was his decision.  But I just wanted to try to
understand from you why you had suggested, why you
 
96
thought
, 
that commissioning
 
an
 
expert group to look at
this question of compensation was the way to go?

--Result #433--

  
Yes.  It starts on page 2.  That's page 1.  If we
go to page 2
, 
we
 can see this is a draft, 
"
Draft
 
2
"
,
22
 
November 2001 from you 
to
 
the
 First Minister
, 
and we
can see the 
"
Purpose
"
:
"
To seek agreement to the Scottish Executive's
formal response on the recommendations made in the
Health and Community Care Committee
 ..."
So just to put this in context, we looked
yesterday with Mr Chisholm at this minute that had been
developed and that he ended up submitting to the Cabinet
for decision
.  
So
 this appears to be 
a 
draft, drafted
during your time
 
and then developed during his time.
The bit that I would draw your attention to on
this question is at page 4.  So
, 
in fact
, 
if we just go
back to page 3
, 
we can see the relevant heading.
It says, "Discussion" and then "Support for Hep C
sufferers
", 
and then if we go over 
to
 
the
 following
page
, 
paragraphs 14 and 17 
are 
the relevant paragraphs
: 
 

29 July 2022
          
          

  97
"
14
.  
Our proposed response to the Committee
therefore rejects these recommendations that propose
financial and practical support for all people who have
contracted Hep C from NHS Scotland blood.  Instead, it
offers to set up an
 
expert group to examine whether the
general principle of offering such support is a) right,
b) practicable
, 
and if so, what universal criteria could
be applied."
Then
 
go down at 17:
"Establish commission to examine system of
negligence and fault
-
based compensation.
"
The response to the Committee falls slightly
short of their recommendation.  It offers to look at the
issue for all health outcomes, rather than just for
blood and blood products.  Also, the proposed review of
the issue could conclude that the general principle was
unsound or impracticable.  In that case the review would
not progress to the detail of 
when
 
and
 
how
 compensation
should be awarded
.  
Nevertheless
, 
establishment of
a review group would represent a significant gesture by
the Executive."
So the question is why had you suggested going
down this route of commissioning an
 
expert group?

--Result #434--

For the transcript the references to the communications
and discussions I mentioned earlier are SCGV0000174_068,
DHSC0038520_109, and SCGV0000247_036.
I'm going to move on to a different topic now, and
it's in relation to the consequences in Scotland to the
decision that was handed down by Mr Justice Burton in
the hepatitis C litigation in March 2001.
I'm going to pick it up in a submission that you
made to the Cabinet on the 6 June 2001, 
once
 you'd
reached your decision about what you were suggesting
Scotland should do
, 
and we find that at SCGV0000243_156.
So 
we
 can see it's 15 June
 -- 
I don't know why
I said 6 June
 -- 
Friday
, 
15 June 2001
, "
For Decision
",
for the Scottish Cabinet
: 
"
Purpose
 
107
"To invite Cabinet to endorse a course of action
regarding compensation for people who have been infected
with hepatitis C as a
 
result of receiving blood (or
blood components) from the National Health Service in
Scotland
.  
This course of action takes 
account
 of the
recent English High Court judgment clarifying the law in
this area
.
"
Then you set out the background to
Mr Justice Burton's judgment and then at 5
, 
it says
this:
"The inevitable consequence of this is that we
cannot avoid the immediate financial consequences of
settling legally valid actions already raised under
CP
--Result #435--
"
Just pausing there, this comes after you had got
legal advice from counsel
.  
We don't need to go to that
but
, 
for the transcript
, 
it's SCGV0000243_161
, a
nd
that's what you're reflecting there in paragraph 5.
Then if we go over the page, you set out your
course of action that you recommend, and if we can pick
it up at five bullet points down, you're setting out
what
 
you've borne in mind, and then you say:
"while we sympathise with individuals affected
, 
we
also have to recognise that any compensation payment
which we make which is not in connection with
 
108
a legitimate action raised under the CPA will make it
virtually impossible in the future to maintain the
general principle of not paying compensation for
non-negligent harm.  Each new special case erodes that
principle."
Then:
"any out of court payment would be a compassionate
move by government
, 
but is likely to be used by pressure
groups, the media and interested MSPs to argue for the
principle of compensation to be extended
 ...
"
Then if we go down to paragraph 8:
"I also considered various up the options such as
hardship funds, a public enquiry, and no-fault
compensation for people affected before the inception of
CP
--Result #436--
  However, my strong view, supported by legal
advice, is to settle only those cases which are exactly
analogous with the English judgment, ie
 
those where the
claimant received blood or blood products contaminated
with Hepatitis C virus after 1st March 19
8
8 and has
raised an
 
action under CPA which is not time-barred
(or
 
likely to be allowed by courts even if it is
time-barred
)
."
Then paragraph 9:
"Any other course of action would establish a new
policy on non-negligent compensation that would have far
 

29 July 2022
          
          

  109
reaching consequences in the future; we would need time
to consider 
this
 very carefully in consultation 
with
 
the
other UK administrations."
Then you set out at paragraph 10 your recommended
course of action.  
Well
: 
"
My recommended 
course 
of action
: 
"
does not conflict with previous government
policy
", 
et cetera
, 
and then
: 
"
removes the need for genuine claimants to fight
their case through the courts 
(
although it is possible
that some claimants will decline to settle on reasonable
terms
, 
in which case we shall face one or more court
cases anyway
) ...
"
Then you go on to sort out the other consequences
of your decision
.
So we can see here you are weighing up on the one
hand the pros and the cons of the consequences of the
judgment
, 
saying
, 
on the one hand, if we pay beyond
those cases that would succeed 
under 
the judgment
, 
if it
applies in Scotland, that would set a precedent
.  
Then
you've consider
ed
 on the other hand a compensation
scheme, and you're balancing that out in this paper for
the Cabinet; is that the right way to understand what
you're doing here?

--Result #437--

So my question is in relation to the precedent point,
and it's this: why would making payments to those who
have received a defective product, so infected blood, as
a result of the judgment, lead to a general principle to
pay compensation for non-negligent harm?  So if we look
back 
at
 the paper that we've just been looking at, it's
the bullet point that says, "While we sympathise with
individuals affected
", 
so about a third of the way down:
"while we sympathise with individuals affected, we
also have to recognise that any compensation payment
which we make which is not in connection with
a legitimate action raised under the CPA ..."
So I understand that to mean
 
if you were to pay
those that had been infected before 1 March 1988
, 
so
before the Consumer Protection Act came into force, the
rationale seems to be
 "
it will make it virtually
impossible in the future to maintain the general
principle of not paying compensation for 
non-
negligent
harm
"
.  And my question to you was
:
 
why was that the
 
114
view that was taken
, 
if those people had received
a defective product?

--Result #438--

So there's two aspects to this, I think
, 
from where I'm
sitting
, 
now and then.
I think what comes through there is that we are
still
 returning to that general principle
 -- 
right,
that -- 
I know that this is, you know, contested 
today
especially in this room, but, you know, we are keeping
coming back to
 "
we have to stick to a general principle
here
"
.  And that -- sorry
, 
just to repeat the full
words
: 
"... 
the general principle of not paying
compensation for non-negligent harm
.
"
The challenge 
in 
the question
 -- 
and the
deliberations
 in 
so many 
rooms, 
over so much time
 --
was
: 
how do you help people who have been affected as
a consequence -- in consequence of infected blood and
blood products and maintain that principle?
And this was another development where -- and this
is where I don't want to comment on the technicalities
because I don't 
feel
 equipped
 
to do that all these years
on
 -- 
you know, this was another process of advice and
recommendation that said that if we were to stick to
that general principle, here's how it applies in this
case.
 
115
And I genuinely and sincerely hope that this
Inquiry
 -- 
you know, because if anybody can do it,
I think, you know, you can, given, you know, the extent
to which you've looked across, you know, all the sort of
policy issues, but also the technical issues and legal
issues and all of those matters, then, you know, I think
if we can get progress, not just for haemophiliacs and
others that have been affected through infected blood,
but frankly others, other
s for the future, progress, to,
you know, get some greater 
clarity
 and definition about
how you deal with harm, whether it's fault
-
based harm or
not, for people that have clearly had an adverse
experience, then, you know, 
I think 
it would be great if
we could, you know, get better 
clarity
 and definition
around that.
At that point in time, we were still, as I say,
going round and round and round trying to work out how
to marry together what many of us would 
feel
 the need,
or desire to do, but equally, had to marry it together
with, you know, that wider framework that we were
working within.
Given where 
we
 were at the time.  As I say, 
yes
,
I know there's been lots of further development and
thinking and discussion and people pushed into that and
tried with varying degrees of success to take different
 
116
decisions, you know, and it's not undermining that
principle.  I understand all of that
.  
I'm just saying
at that moment in time we were still working round and
round that
.

--Result #439--

  
Thank you.  
Well,
 as I 
have 
said,
I have some important things to say.
Until September, of course, the Inquiry's work
will continue but I would like to speak to you about two
things in particular.  First, on the Inquiry timetable,
and then to update you on the question of interim
payments.
Firstly, the timetable.
The majority of legal representatives of people
infected and affected have asked me to put back the date
when they have to submit written submissions to me from
24 October to 23 December
, 
with oral submissions to
 
148
follow next year.
They suggest next year starting on 20 January.
There are good reasons for this request.  They
point out that to do justice to the evidence that we
will hear in September and early October, and to allow
proper time for consultation with their clients, more
time is necessary for the preparation of final
submissions.  They argue that this should enable more
helpful and focused submissions, and thus result in 
no
loss
 of speed overall.  And I accept that none of the
participants wish to prolong this Inquiry a day longer
than is necessary and I join them in that
.
Well,
 I'm going to accommodate that request
,
although with two 
slight
 modifications.  A new deadline
for these final written submissions on the evidence will
be 16 December this year.  16 December this year. 
That's a Friday.
It follows that the time for oral submissions will
also need to be moved, and these will now be heard
during the weeks of the 16th, which is 
a
 Monday, 23
 
and
30
 
January, the weeks beginning on those dates.
Second, interim payments.  
Well
, as you know, on
15 July I invited submissions from Core Participants and
Government bodies on whether I should exercise my powers
to make a recommendation about interim payments.
 

29 July 2022
          
          

  149
The Inquiry received 
15 
submissions on this
matter, all of which urged me to recommend that an
interim payment should be made.  In addition to those
formal submissions, the Inquiry received several hundred
emails from individuals
, 
which indicates the strength of
feeling among the Inquiry participants.
Having considered the submissions as well as the
evidence and report by Sir Robert Francis QC, I have
today
, in line with the requirements of the
Inquiries
 
Act, 
sent
 my report on interim payments to the
Minister.  I have disclosed it to Core Participants.
In advance of my sending the report to him, he
gave me the permission to publish it, and I should say
that it's a requirement under the Act that I have the
Minister's permission to publish and he gave it to me.
I have decided that my report exactly as delivered
to the Minister will be published on the Inquiry's
website 
once
 these proceedings have concluded 
today
.  It
is a report about interim payments only.  As you read
it, please bear in mind that the full-scale of the
evidence heard and read by the Inquiry
, 
and the results
of its investigative work, can only be recognised in my
final report.  Please also remember I have 
no
 power to
order interim payments.  My sole power is to make
a recommendation.  It doesn't have to be accepted by
 
150
Government, nor does it have to be accepted in full.
I set out to answer two questions.  First, whether
I should exercise my powers to make a recommendation
that interim payments should be made, and second -- oh
,
I should say
, 
I have recommended that they should
!
The second issue concerned the scope of those
payments, and this is more complex.
Sir Robert Francis QC recommended interim payments
because the payment of full compensation could not be
delivered quickly.  He made a compelling case that
interim payments are needed now to alleviate suffering,
and further suffering, and I agree with him and I am
obliged to recognise that 
the
 practical way to make
payments swiftly is to do so through the current
infected blood support schemes.  And that's why I've
decided to recommend that interim payments of 
no
 less
than £100,000 are made to all the infected people and
all the bereaved partners who are currently registered
with the schemes and those who register between now and
the inception of any future scheme.
I know that that will be disappointing to some of
you who 
may 
fall into neither category, and I apologise
for that.  I ask those who are disappointed to remember
that this is not the end of the Inquiry's work and the
question of compensation and its scope is not resolved
 
151
in this short report on interim payments.  I repeat.
The interim report concerns only whether I should
recommend interim payments.
Finally
, 
let me say this.  I know that many of you
follow the Inquiry's work closely, but I am conscious
that being a participant in an inquiry can bring with it
an emotional burden.  The Inquiry team will continue
working 
a
way preparing for the next hearings but
, 
until
we meet again in September, I wish you a peaceful and
restorative break.  Thank you.

--Result #440--
 Well, there was most definitely an influence coming
across the Atlantic, in that the American situation 
50 meant that they were targeting prisons quite 
extensively because they had, in more ways than one ,
a captive donor organisation waiting for them, with
an added incentive, so we understood, of providing 
monetary compensation to the prisoners.  And there was 
certainly more indication that cases of 
post-transfusion hepatitis, which was the major 
problem in those days, was coming from donations wh ich 
had been taken in the prisons.  So extrapolating th is 
into the English situation, although the prisoners 
were not quite so -- a hotbed of drug use as they 
became, we decided that the safest thing by far was  to 
stop taking blood in prisons.

--Result #441--
   That's right, sir.  There was a report on 
6 May 1983 to the CDSC about this patient.  It may be 
that that's the patient who was being referred to 
here.  There was another patient in Bristol, I'm no t 
quite so familiar with the chronology of that patie nt 
but my understanding is that it may not have become
common knowledge until later in 1983 that there was
a Bristol patient with AIDS too.
I'm going to move forward to the beginning of 
1984.  Now, Drs Foster and Perry will be able to 
correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is th at 
the trials of PFC's first heat-treated Factor VIII 
products didn't take place, as it was thought they  
107 might, during 1983, during the summer or later 1983 , 
that they in fact started towards the start of 1984 , 
January to March.  
An important date in the chronology to note is 
January 1984, Professor Ludlam reports an adverse 
reaction in one of his patients who has been treate d 
with this pasteurised trial Factor VIII.  He report s 
symptoms like chest pain, retching. 
Dr Forbes provides some -- a report of these 
early observations of the product in March 1984, wi th 
no adverse reactions.  Now, during the remainder of
the first half of 1984 and the beginning of the 
second, it appears that the focus of the PFC contin ues 
to be on producing a pasteurised Factor VIII produc t,
and that's not to say that there weren't some -- 
wasn't some consideration given to dry heat treatme nt, 
I believe starting during 1983.  I won't go into th e 
details of that but, in terms of the overall focus,  it 
seems that continued to be pasteurisation until lat er 
in 1984. 
There's then a major shift that occurs in PFC's 
strategy.  It appears to be linked to two events 
around the same time.  The first is the discovery i n 
October 1984 that a cohort of patients in Edinburgh
who had been treated with PFC Factor VIII had  
108 developed antibodies to HIV -- HTLV-III, as it was 
then. 
Now, the Inquiry has explored the timing related
to that discovery and other evidence, no doubt it c an 
be picked up with the witnesses we'll be hearing fr om 
so I won't go into it any further.  Alongside that 
discovery, on the 1 to 2 November 1984, a plasma 
fractionation conference took place in the 
Netherlands, somewhere called Groningen.  It was 
attended by Dr Foster, Dr Perry, and Dr McIntosh as
well, of the PFC.  During that conference it was 
reported that dry heat treatment appeared to 
successfully inactivate HIV. 
Those attendees come back from the conference, 
there is a major change in the PFC's approach durin g 
the course of November and December 1983 to dry 
heating the existing PFC Factor VIII concentrate. 
What appears to have taken place is that the stocks
which existed of PFC NY, normal intermediate unheat ed 
product were heat treated from December -- a point in 
December 1984.  That product begins to be sent out to 
RTCs in Scotland and also Haemophilia Centres, and the 
PFC and the wider SNBTS introduce or appear to 
introduce a policy of seeking to re-call unheated 
products that was at RTCs and was also in blood ban ks                                   
 
                             09 and possibly stocks of home treated product as well ,
although it may be that there's more to explore on 
those details. 
So we get into 1985 and this first heat-treated 
product is being introduced.  The type of treatment ,
as I said, was dry heat treatment, it was heated at
68 degrees for two hours. 
Now, that gets us into 1985.  I'm going to say 
very little about what happened with Factor IX duri ng 
the period we've just looked at, the '83 to 
'84 period, other than to say that there was some 
early investigation into heat treating Factor IX 
during that period.  Heat-treated products, Factor IX, 
is not introduced as we've seen also in December 19 84. 
It comes a little later. 
So we're into 1985.  PFC is continuing to 
explore further the heat treatment of its Factor VI II 
product and, in particular, to explore different he at 
treatment viral inactivation regimes being applied to 
its product, not just 68 degrees for two hours.  We 've 
set out the detail of some of those attempts in the
written note.  What appears to take place is that,
from around January to September 1985, the first 
heat-treated product, the first generation product,
the 68 degrees for two hours is issued.  From aroun d  
110 September 1985, it's replaced by a second generatio n 
product which is heated at 68 degrees for 24 hours.
Now, as part of that policy of introducing the 
second generation of product, there appears to have
been a PFC policy of exhausting existing stocks of 
heat-treated product before bringing in the second -- 
the new generation one.  So, in other words, it may  be 
that a product treated for 24 hours at 68 degrees w as 
available earlier but, before it was introduced to 
RTCs and the patients, they would exhaust the first
generation product, all of that would be used up. 
The new product would be introduced through 
a batch dedication scheme that had, by then, been 
introduced at the PFC.  I mentioned this briefly 
earlier.  I'm going to go into very little detail 
about it, sir, save to note that, in the written 
presentation, we've picked up a suggestion from 
Professor Cash in 1983, November 1983, that the SNB TS 
and PFC might need to be considering some sort of 
batch dedication arrangement. 
He raises it again, Professor Cash, at the 
2 February 1984 meeting that we looked at earlier. 
There's then a period between February 1984 and ear ly 
1985 where it's not quite clear, at least from the 
documents, what happens to this proposal to introdu ce  
111 a batch dedication system. 
It then comes in around March 1985, and I'm just 
going to go to a document which briefly explains it . 
It's PRSE0004101. 
This is, we can see from the title, a PFC report 
that was prepared for a meeting in March 1985. 
If we go through to page 5, please, there are 
other parts of this document that are certainly wor th 
considering.  It has an update on heat treatment.  If 
we go down to the second half of the page, there's 
an explanation of the approach to batch dedication.
It says: 
"The ability to prospectively dedicate whole 
batches of product to individual patients or groups  of 
patients depends, for success, on substantial reser ves 
of product.  Such reserves are now available and it  is 
now possible to implement a system of limited batch
exposure. 
"Briefly, such a system would operate by 
dividing patients into groups (on a regional basis)
with each group receiving product from a designate 
batch held at the RTC.  RTCs would also carry reser ve 
batches for replacement of 'active' batches where 
these became exhausted." 
Then it sets out how groups of patients might be  
112 divided up and then, at the bottom of this section of 
the report, it says: 
"Present estimates indicate that such a system 
can be in place by the end of March 1985 with exist ing 
product which will sustain supply until Autumn 1985 ." 
Now, it appears that a batch dedication system 
was introduced around this time, and that it remain s 
in place until at least some time in 1987.  The exa ct 
end date isn't completely clear from the documents.
So we're now into -- late in 1985, PFC's second 
generation heat treated Factor VIII, heated for 
24 hours, is being issued.  Research is being 
undertaken into a third generation of product and, so 
far as it appears from the documents, that appears to 
be because it was understood, at the time, that hea t 
treating -- dry heat treating at 68 degrees for 
24 hours should be successful in inactivating 
HIV/HTLV-III but was thought unlikely to inactivate
non-A, non-B hepatitis.  In other words, this 68 
degrees, 24-hour product could still transmit non-A , 
non-B hepatitis. 
We're done with that document now, thanks, 
Sully. 
So there then begins focused or more research, 
rather, on this new product which becomes to be kno wn                                   
 
                             13 as Z8. 
There's -- it seems that there's a change of 
direction which happens towards the end of 
December 1985, with the focus on this Z8 product,
which will involve heating for 72 hours at 80 degre es,
ie the same amount of time, the same temperature, a s 
the BPL 8Y product, which we heard about last week 
during the hearings on England and Wales. 
I'm not going to go into all of the detail 
around the development of Z8.  What would appear to
happen is that the product has been developed.  Aro und 
August 1986, there is some difficulties encountered  in 
manufacturing it at a large scale, scaling it up fr om 
the initial small test batches.  There's a referenc e 
in a 29 August 1986 letter from Dr Perry to an 
11th hour problem with freeze drying. 
We get to late 1986, around December 1986, and 
it appears that Z8, this new product, which it is 
hoped will be effective against non-A, non-B hepati tis 
as well as HIV, is ready for clinical trial. 
Now, while this product development was taking 
place, there had been a number of letters and some 
discussions around what's termed in the documents 
"compensation arrangements for patients".  Now, wha t 
this relates to is the arrangements for compensatin g  
114 patients who participate in clinical trials in the 
case of an adverse reaction.  Dr Ludlam had raised 
this issue some time earlier.  It had not been 
resolved.  Resolving it required the involvement of
the Scottish Home and Health Department and others.
We get to the beginning of 1987.  Dr Ludlam 
raises his concern again, and effectively appears t o 
say, "I'm not prepared to enter my patients into th e 
clinical trials of Z8 until this issue has been 
resolved." 
There's some evidence that Haemophilia Centre 
Directors in other parts of Scotland adopt a simila r 
position.  There's correspondence back and forth wi th 
a number of individuals, including at the Scottish 
Home and Health Department.  It appears around 
February 1987 some form of compensation arrangement  is 
agreed, at least with the clinical trial aspect. 
Trials appear to begin around February 1987 for Z8.
We then get to April, and it seems that the 
SNBTS and PFC, following those clinical trials, are
ready to start issuing Z8 on more of a routine basi s. 
It seems, generally speaking, to be fed into that 
batch dedication system that we discussed and to 
reflect the policy of exhausting stocks.  At least 
from the documents, there's a suggestion that those 
115 existing policies might be subject to a caveat for 
certain patients, in particular patients who had 
been -- not been treated previously with factor 
concentrates, or treated very little with factor 
concentrates, on the basis that they were understoo d 
to be the highest priority for a new product which was 
hoped to be effective against non-A, non-B hepatiti s 
as well as other viruses. 
Now, that's a brief overview of the position on 
heat treatment of Factor VIII products. 
Factor IX we've covered in a reasonable amount 
of detail in the written note. 
As we get into 1985, with a heat treated 
Factor VIII product in existence but no heat treate d 
Factor IX, Haemophilia Centre Directors start to as k 
PFC what might be happening and when they might exp ect 
a heat-treated Factor IX.  Around that time, and in
fact even before from some years previously, there' s 
an explanation that in order to introduce a Factor IX 
heat-treated product, there might be additional 
complexities because of the need to ensure that the
product is not going to result in -- I always 
pronounce this wrong -- thrombo -- 

--Result #442--
 Who was a minister, I can't remember the precise 
years, but at some point in the course of the 1990s . 
Would that have been, do you think, in relation to the 
campaign for compensation for haemophiliacs infecte d 
with hepatitis C?

--Result #443--
 And there were obviously number of other issues, in 
66 particular HCV litigation and the issue of 
compensation for hepatitis C that you also had some
involvement with.  Were those -- again, the ones I' ve 
mentioned, are they the main areas or were there lo ts 
of other things that took up your time in that peri od 
'92 to '97? 

--Result #444--
   Thank you, sir. 
So we can see it's your note to Dr Pickles,
copied to others, on that meeting on 16 June 1989. 
I just want to draw your attention to two points an d 
then pick up the theme of one of them at a later 
stage.  But on the issue I was just asking you abou t, 
if we go to page 4, bottom of the page, we can see it 
said: 
"Several doctors suggested that a no-fault 
compensation scheme should be available."  
Then, top of the next page, so paragraph 19, you 
describe: 
"Several doctors suggested that the financial 
and manpower consideration should be put to the 
Government and the pressure should be brought to be ar 
on the Government to sort out the problem." 
You refer to Dr Jones, Dr Hill and then to 
Dr Bane, saying it had been Government policy not t o 
speed up production of Factor VIII at Elstree to 
become self-sufficient in the late 1970s.  
So is that the kind of way in which this issue 
was raised with you by doctors, by the Haemophilia 
Centre Directors? 

--Result #445--
 -- which reads as follows: 
"DHA/RHAs [so that's District Health 
Authorities/Regional Health Authorities] be told th at 
no money is to be made available to them from centr al  
110 funds.  In this way the DHA/RHAs will be encouraged  to 
depend the actions.  It has been made clear us to t hat 
the Haemophilia Centre Directors as well as the 
DHA/RHAs would like the government to pay compensat ion 
without the need for any further legal action, and 
they are encouraged in this by the Haemophilia 
Society.  They do not appreciate that the total cos t 
would be at least 1200 [times] £250K [equals]
£300 million, (THREE HUNDRED MILLION) [then set out  in 
capital letters in brackets] as well as the risk of
such compensation being extended to benzodiazepines
(currently the subject of litigation), Sellafield, 
etc, etc." 
Now, couple of points, Dr Rejman.  First of all,
is it right to understand that what you're reportin g 
here is a positive decision by the Department to tr y 
to ensure that the Health Authorities defend the 
actions, that they don't settle the actions again 
brought against them by plaintiffs? 

--Result #446--
   Where a claim is what you're 
claiming about which is generally -- in the injury 
context, is generally the injury or disease you hav e 
suffered, full stop.  The reason for the claim is t hat 
you say that there has been a breach of a duty owed  to 
you by the person you're claiming the money or the  
14 compensation or whatever it may be, from.  So the 
claim is what you have actually suffered.  The reas on 
for the claim or the basis for the claim is then se t 
out, generally speaking, in the start of a document , 
and in this context it's a claim for everything tha t 
went on leading to the fact that individuals claimi ng 
that it was in breach of duty that they suffered HI V 
infection.  I don't think the claim was for hepatit is 
infection. 

--Result #447--
 So that's being drawn to the attention of the Prime
Minister.  If we go to the next page, we will see 
there is then a background note, which refers to th e 
settlement negotiations.  We're not proposing to go
through that. 
If we go to page 5, we can see then this is 
a briefing in relation to "HIV Infected Blood 
Transfusion Recipients".  The first paragraph says:  
"... Government does not accept the case for 
no fault compensation ... recognised that special 
circumstances applied [to haemophiliacs]." 
There's reference there to the double disadvantage 
of the haemophilia and then HIV, and also to the fa ct 
that it can mean -- because haemophilia is heredita ry, 
it can mean more than one member of the family 
affected.
Then the statement in the last two paragraphs: 
"A similar combination of factors would not 
generally apply to blood transfusion cases.  
"In principle blood transfusion cases are no 
different from other people who suffered medical  
42 accidents or the unintended side effects of 
treatment." 
So is it right to understand that, at the point 
in time at which the Haemophilia Litigation was 
settled, the Department's line in relation to those
infected with HIV thorough transfusional tissue was  no 
financial assistance? 

--Result #448--
 Reading this, I mean to say, I think it seems quite
clear that, in essence, I think the Government, as had 
previous governments, was opposed to 
no-fault compensation, even though this was somethi ng  
43 that was raised by a number of the haemophilia doct ors 
and other doctors at various times, that they wante d 
a no-fault compensation because they thought this 
would solve all the problems. 
And I think at the time when they decided to make 
the payments to the haemophilia sufferers, they 
decided that because of the -- well, unique 
circumstances that they were dealing with, this was
a reason to make the payments.
And at that time, the pressure from the public, 
the press, the MPs, haemophiliacs and everybody els e, 
was that this was a special case that merited 
a special treatment.

--Result #449--
   Dr Rejman, I want to ask you next, without, 
168 I think, on this topic going to any particular 
document going to any document about hepatitis C 
financial support. 
So we looked at the haemophilia litigation, we 
have looked more briefly at the establishment of wh at 
became the Eileen Trust.  It's right, I think, that ,
throughout the 1990s, but probably particularly acu te 
in 1994, 1995 and 1996, the question of whether to 
provide compensation or financial support to those 
infected with hepatitis C, was raised -- 

--Result #450--
   Yes. 
So that takes us, sir, then to 26 October 2000 
when the BSE Inquiry report was published, and on t he 
same date the government announced it would set up 
a fund for the care of victims of vCJD to ensure 
a speedy response to diagnosis and improvement in t he 
quality of care for such patients to be coordinated
through the Research and Surveillance Unit in 
Edinburgh and a compensation scheme operated throug h 
a special trust fund. 
Then we know from the evidence we have heard in 
the last few days that the first meeting of the CJD
Incidents Panel took place on 10 November 2000. 
And then in December 2000, BPL -- on 
14 December 2000, BPL notified consignees of the 
expired product that had been provided, made from 
donations of a donor diagnosed with vCJD. 
Then we see on 18 January from The Haemophilia 
Society and from 19 January from UKHCDO to Haemophi lia 
Centre Directors correspondence relating to that. 
So 18 January, Haemophilia Society notifies 
its -- posts a letter to its members notifying them  of 
the fact that some expired BPL products have been u sed                                   
 
                             53 from plasma obtained from a donor who has now been 
diagnosed with vCJD.  And that information is also 
communicated by the UKHCDO to the Haemophilia Centr e 
Directors on 19 January.  
And then on 29 January 2001, Lord Hunt, in 
a written answer to a Parliamentary question, state d 
that the UKHCDO, in consultation with the Departmen t 
of Health, had agreed a policy of giving all 
haemophilia patients information about the 
December 2000 vCJD incident, BPL incident, and 
offering them the choice as to whether they wish to
know whether they or their children had received th e 
implicated clotting factor.
Then in May -- February and May -- between 
February and May 2001, we see these draft letters f rom 
the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Pat -- Dr Troop t hat 
we have looked at in the hearings over the last few
days.  Interim guidance on what hospitals should be
telling patients about vCJD implicated products.  A nd 
we still don't know whether or not that was ever 
issued, but we will continue to investigate that. 
Then we know as well from the evidence that has 
been given over the last few days that on 
10 October 2001, the CJD Incidents Panel launched i ts 
consultation on the management of possible exposure  of  
154 CJD through medical procedure, which included its 
consultation on informing and notifying people abou t 
their exposure to vCJD. 
Jumping forward now to 15 August 2002.  We have 
an announcement from Hazel Blears that the National
Blood Authority has been instructed to import fresh
frozen plasma from the USA for neonates and childre n 
born after 1 January 1996, and that this would be 
virally inactivated using methylene blue treatment.
Then between October and November 2002, the 
Inquiry has a series of letters from Professor Lowe ,
as co-director of the Scotland and Northern Ireland
Haemophilia Centre Directors group, to the Scottish
CMO, Dr Armstrong, and then letters from the 
haemophilia centres to patients, and then indeed 
a letter from Dr Keel, the Deputy Chief Medical 
Officer, to Professor Lowe in relation to the fact 
that the Scottish and Northern Irish Haemophilia 
Centre Directors had been informed eight months 
previously about a SNBTS batches of product that ha d 
been contributed to by somebody who had died from 
vCJD.  And they had been unable to -- they were 
waiting for guidance from the CJD Incidents Panel, and 
it hadn't been forthcoming, and so they were inform ing 
the Chief Medical Officer that they were going to g ive  
155 information to their patients about that incident, and 
indeed that is what they did. 
On 17 December 2002, the Department of Health 
purchased an independent US plasma collector, Life 
Resources Incorporated.  If we could just look at t he 
press release in relation to that.  It is 
HCDO0000266_021. 
What's said there is that: 
"The Department of Health has today purchased 
the largest remaining independent US plasma collect or, 
Life Resources Incorporated, to secure long-term 
supplies of non-UK blood plasma for the benefit of NHS 
patients.  This deal, which was completed in the US
yesterday evening, will ensure that the current glo bal 
plasma shortage will not reduce the availability to
NHS patients of life-saving plasma products such as
immunoglobulins and clotting factors." 
Then if we go down to the third paragraph: 
"The plasma from Life Resources will be 
manufactured into plasma products by the NHS owned Bio 
Products Laboratory who supply 45% of NHS needs.  T he 
NHS has been using US sourced plasma since 1998 as 
part of its vCJD risk reduction strategy.  The US h as 
no reported cases of BSE.  It is also the only coun try 
able to supply the quality of plasma we need in  
156 sufficient quantity.  The US collects 60% of the 
world's plasma and supplies between 35%-45% of the 
plasma products used in Europe alone." 
In February 2003, we have the second version -- 
the updated version of the DNV risk assessment of 
exposure to vCJD infectivity in blood and blood 
products, and Professor Ironside gave us some evide nce 
in relation to that.
Then on 9 June 2003, as we have heard over the 
last few days, the Chief Medical Officer responded on 
behalf of all of the four chief medical officers fr om 
the four countries in the UK to the CJD Incidents 
Panel framework document. 
In December 2003, the Department of Health 
accepted the final version of the framework documen t.
And then we heard today that was published in 
March 2004. 
On 22 January 2004, there was an extraordinary 
meeting of the MSBT convened to discuss the 
implications to the UK blood services of a case of 
possible transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion.
And it was agreed that previously transfused donors , 
ie those who had received transfusions after 
1 January 1980, should be excluded from donating.  And 
that date was chosen on the basis that there would                                   
 
                             57 have been no dietary exposure to BSE in the UK befo re 
then.  It was agreed that that exclusion should rel ate 
to UK transfusions only, and that advice was 
subsequently accepted by all four of the devolved 
administrations. 
We then have on 21 April 2004 the meeting of the 
CJD Incidents Panel technical subgroup that we have
heard about from Professor Ironside and the decisio n 
that they made on that date to notify patients with
bleeding disorders under what's been called the 
umbrella approach. 
On 22 July 2004, Dr John Reid, who was then the 
Secretary of State for Health, in a written 
ministerial statement announced the second probable
case of vCJD transmission through a blood transfusi on. 
On 9 September 2004, there is a further 
ministerial statement by the secretary of State for
Health, Dr John Reid, announcing the notification 
exercise that we have been hearing about over the l ast 
few days. 
On 20 July 2005, Caroline Flint, the 
Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the 
Department of Health, in a written ministerial 
statement gave a report on the 2005 notification 
process.  
158 On 31 June 2006 (sic), we see guidance being 
published on the assessment to be carried out befor e 
surgery and/or endoscopy to identify patients with 
an increased risk of CJD or vCJD, known as annex J.
Can we turn to that, please.  It is 
WITN00093024.  So we can see here that this is 
a summary that has been revised since January 2014,
but it says this: 
"Annex J provides a method of assessing CJD and 
vCJD risk prior to surgery or endoscopy. 
"Certain groups of patients have been informed 
that they are at increased risk of CJD or vCJD.
"Therefore, it is recommended that all patients 
about to undergo any surgery or endoscopy should be
asked if they have ever been notified as being at 
increased risk of CJD or vCJD. 
"In addition, patients undergoing surgery or 
neuro-endoscopy, which may involve contact with 
tissues of potentially high level TSE infectivity 
('high risk tissues') should, through a set of 
detailed questions, be assessed for their possible,
unrecognised CJD/vCJD risk." 
So in relation to that, all patients, we go to 
page 2, please.  And we see the recommendation ther e: 
"Recommendation for all surgical and endoscopy  
159 patients."
The question that is recommended: all patients 
should be asked: 
"Have you ever been notified that you are at 
increased risk of CJD or vCJD for public health 
purposes?" 
Then depending on what the response is,
different actions are set out below. 
Then for the patients that are undergoing 
a surgery or neuro-endoscopy involving high risk 
tissues, we see -- we go, please, to page 4., and w e 
see the series of questions that should be put to 
these patients down the left-hand side: 
"1.  Have you a history of CJD or other prion 
disease in your family?  If Yes, please specify. 
"2.  Have you ever received growth hormone or 
gonadotrophin treatment? 
"3.  Have you ever had surgery on your brain or 
spinal cord?"
Then, depending on what the answer is, the 
actions are set out there. 
Then on 18 January 2007, the Health Protection 
Agency issued a press release reporting the fourth 
case of vCJD transmission associated with blood 
transfusion.   
160 And on 28 March 2007, a report from the vCJD 
Clinical Governance Advisory Group, chaired by Sir 
William Stewart, is published.  I won't go to that 
report for reasons of time, but for those that want  to 
look at it, it is at HCDO0000902.  That report make s 
a series of recommendations about the appropriate 
clinical governance arrangements, including follow- up 
care and support for individuals identified as at r isk 
from developing vCJD, and it also advises on 
appropriate monitoring of such individuals.  In 
particular, it makes recommendations about the 
appropriate relationship between such people's GP, 
their local neurologist, and the specialist service s 
such as the Prion Unit. 
In June 2008, the Protein Fractionation Centre 
in Scotland closes. 
In February 2009, we see the Health Protection 
Agency writing to all UK Haemophilia Centre Directo rs 
notifying them of the post-mortem finding of 
asymptomatic vCJD in a person with haemophilia and 
informing them that it did not change the public 
health at risk status of any such patients.  We hea rd 
evidence both from Professor Ironside in relation t o 
that finding and from Dr Connor in relation to that
correspondence.                                   
 
                             61 Then on 5 February 2009, the CJD Incidents Panel 
meeting noted the CMO had accepted the Panel's 
recommendation for a two-pronged strategy for highl y 
transfused individuals. 
So the first prong of the strategy was to 
identify highly transfused patients with 80 or more
donor exposures, and that would be done through 
pre-assessment for surgery and neuro-endoscopy on h igh 
risk tissue, and that was to start in April 2009.  In 
other words, those who are presenting for such surg ery 
would be asked whether or not they had had 80 or mo re 
donor exposures, and that would be how they would b e 
identified.
The second prong would be a prospective 
notification of very highly transfused patients wit h 
more than 800 donor exposures, and that was to star t 
in July 2009, and that strategy was noted as having
been approved by the Chief Medical Officers for all
four nations. 
We then see in July 2009 changes being made to 
annex J. 
Can we have, please, RLIT0001222.  This is 
a letter from Health Protection Scotland and NHS 
National Services Scotland to Chief Executives of N HS 
Boards about:  
162 "Pre-surgical assessment for vCJD risk in 
neurosurgery and eye surgery units." 
It says this: 
"Your hospitals should already be using annex 
J."
And we've have just looked at that.
"We are writing to inform you that annex J of 
the TSE Infection Control guidance has recently bee n 
revised and now advises that patients who are due t o 
have high risk surgery or neuroendoscopy should be 
asked whether they have received transfusions of bl ood 
or blood components from 80 or more donors since 19 80. 
This is because these patients may have an increase d 
risk of being infected with vCJD, and special 
infection control precautions should be followed fo r 
their high risk surgery or neuroendoscopy.  This ma y 
involve destroying surgical instruments.
"If a patient is found to have an increased risk 
of vCJD due to receipt of blood from 80 or more 
donors, this information should be marked on their 
medical records and the patient will need to be 
informed of their increased risk via HPS and their 
GP." 
Then it says: 
"Please forward this letter and enclosed  
163 document to the leads for surgery haematology and 
infection control in your board." 
We then come to 3 February 2011 and the 
publication by Professor Collinge and others on his
blood based assay test.  We had information and 
evidence from Professor Collinge in relation to tha t. 
Then on 31 March 2011, as we heard from 
Professor -- in fact I don't think we did -- SEAC w as 
abolished. 
On 24 January 2013, we have a letter from the 
Health Protection Agency to UKHCDO.  
If we turn that up, please, it is WITN3775004. 
This is in relation to the de-notification process,
and it says that -- it is a letter from HPA to the 
UKHCDO -- no, sorry, to the UK Haemophilia Doctors 
Association, and it says: 
"In 2012 the Health Protection Agency reviewed 
the risk assessment for vCJD transmission through t he 
receipt of UK-sourced plasma products.  This has le d 
to the recommendations that (i) individuals who 
received Factor VIII and Factor IX between 1990 and
2001 should remain notified as at increased risk of
vCJD for public health purposes, (ii) individuals w ho 
only received plasma products between 1980 and 1989
should now have their treatment history re-assessed  to  
164 confirm this fact, and if it is confirmed, they sho uld 
be de-notified." 
Then, on 24 July 2014 the House of Commons 
Science and Technology Committee published its repo rt 
After the Storm?  which we looked at briefly today. 
I want to turn to that again and just read out a fe w 
of the passages there.  It is WITN3733002. 
It is a lengthy report and for reasons of time 
I'm not going to read out very much of it and other s 
can look at it if they wish, but it is helpful to l ook 
at the summary, which we find at page 5. 
Third paragraph down: 
"While cases of vCJD are now rare, recent 
studies indicate that tens of thousands of people i n 
the UK might be silent carriers of the prions 
responsible for the disease and could transmit thes e 
prions to others." 
Next paragraph: 
"The Government acknowledges this risk and 
claims that, like its predecessors, it has taken 
a precautionary standards in response.  However, wh ile 
administrations in the late 1990s assumed the worst
and took steps to prevent it from happening, the 
Government recently appears to have adopted a more 
optimistic approach in which the low incidence of                                   
 
                             65 identified cases of vCJD is used as justification f or 
inaction.  This is particularly evident in the 
Government's less than enthusiastic response to 
emerging vCJD risk mitigation technologies such as 
prion filtration and the prototype of vCJD blood as say 
recently developed by the MRC Prion Unit. 
"In this report we remind the Government that no 
evidence of harm is not the same as evidence of no 
harm." 
Then last paragraph there: 
"The Government's casual attitude to vCJD 
transmission is not combined to blood transfusion . .."
And it sets out the view about risks to surgical 
transmission. 
If we go over the page, please, the last 
paragraph there: 
"At the conclusion of this Inquiry we are 
unconvinced that the Government has done all that i t 
potentially could do to ensure that the UK blood 
supply is and continues to be free of dangerous 
pathogens.  We therefore conclude by recommending t hat 
the Government commission a full assessment of the key 
risks, known and unknown, that the UK blood supply 
currently faces and might face in the future, so th at 
it can identify and fill relevant knowledge gaps an d  
166 support the development of appropriate risk-reducti on 
measures and technologies." 
Then we come to --

That said it all
.
Sir Robert, can we pick up where we left off
yesterday.  We were looking at the position of those who
were infect
ed
 
and
 what they might recover on your
recommendations
, 
and there was 
an
 issue we touched on
relating to the Judicial Studies Board Guidelines and
the cases of Simmons v Castle, it probably seems
esoteric to those here, amongst 
which 
I include myself
who don't 
practice in personal injury law, but 
I'm going
to ask you to look 
at
 
a
 document 
I know you looked at
overnight.  
I'm going to read out what
's
 been said about
it to me by one of the legal representatives and then
invite your comment
.
Can we have RLIT0001640
:
"Guide
lines for the assessment of general damages 
in
personal injury cases
"
If we go over the page
, 
we can see this is the
document we were referring to yesterday, so the Judicial
College's Guidelines
.  
"General damages" refers
essentially to damages 
for
 pain and suffering
, 
and this
is the 16th
 
edition
, 
which we mentioned in the course of
yesterday afternoon
.
 
3
If we go to page 13
, 
please
: 
"
Updated Note on 10% Uplift
"
So this refers to the Simmons v Castle issue
, 
which
I raised yesterday afternoon.
If we just go to I think the last three
paragraphs
 -- 
perhaps last two paragraphs.  Sorry
, 
can
we start above that, my fault:
"Aside from mesothelioma cases 
(
where different
provisions apply and where in consequence we have
continued to provide pre-uplift figures in the relevant
part of Chapter 6
), 
there are now likely to be very few
ongoing cases in which the pre
-
uplift figures will be
relevant.  From the sixteenth edition
, 
we have now only
provided figures 
which 
include
 
the 10% uplift:
"However, we are aware there 
will 
be some cases in
which the pre
-
uplift figures remain relevant.
In
 
particular
, we know there are lawyers working in our
jurisdictions who use the Guidelines but where the
'
Simmons' uplift does not apply.  Should it be necessary
to do so, the uplifted figure can be easily be converted
back 
to a pre-uplift figure simply by multiplying by
a factor of 
0.909."
Just 
before I ask you to comment on that
, 
can I give
you what I have been asked to explore with you and then
invite your comment.
 
4
So this is 
an
 observation from one of the co-authors
of these guidelines.
If the aim is for the tariff in the compensation
scheme largely to mirror what might be obtained in
court, almost every award of general damages made today
includes the 10%
.  
Cases where the 10% uplift is not
awarded today 
are
 so rare that the editors of the
guidelines ha
ve
 chosen to drop the column which doesn't
have the 10% uplift.  In effect
,
 therefore
,
 what the man
on the street sees 
as
 the right figure for damages in
any given case is the figure 
which is 
uplifted by 10%.
With that rather lengthy introduction
, 
Sir Robert,
what if any observations do you have?

--Result #452--

Well
, 
I mean
, 
with respect
, 
I disagree
, 
and I disagree
to this extent
, 
that the 
purpose
 of my recommendations
is to reflect the compensation someone might get for
their injury.  The 10% uplift in these guidelines is
intended to reflect 
an
 obligation to pay fees out of
those damages to lawyers.
That
, 
in relation to 
a
 compensation scheme
, 
is
perhaps 
an
 area we have yet to come to
, 
and maybe you
will be asking me about
, 
but 
it's 
the 
actual damages --
sorry, the 
compensation, in my view, should be
completely different from any consideration as to when,
if at all, fees should be paid to 
a
 lawyer
.
 

12 July 2022
          
          

  5
So
 
I -- and in any event, the conditional fee
agreement
s -- 
and I don't profess to be 
an
 expert in
them
 -- 
do not apply, I would have thought, to 
a
 claim
for compensation under 
a
 compensation scheme.  The Act
under which such agreements are lawful relates only to
claims in court.

--Result #453--

  
Which, in America, is done by the
lawyer taking 
a
 cut of the damages, but in this country
it was thought that the principle should be that
compensation should be 100 per cent, so the person who
was entitled to it should get everything, every penny
that they were seeking
; 
is that correct?

--Result #454--

Yes.  
Well, 
as I
, 
say it seemed to me that the issue
around legal representation or advice and so on in
relation to the scheme needs to be considered clearly
because it
's
 
a
 question, but it needs to be considered
separately from the award compensation
, 
and it
's
 for
that reason I suggested that
, 
insofar as one refers to
these guidelines
, 
one should take the figure without the
uplift and which you can get to
 -- 
I'm not sure the word
"
simply
"
 is one I would agree with
, 
but by multiplying
the figure by the fraction 
that's 
mentioned here
.

--Result #455--

Now
, 
the family care award you deal with at
 
26
paragraph 9.110
: 
"
Where 
a
 Care Award has not been made to the
infected person
, Eligible affected persons as defined
should be 
able to claim directly for claim they 
have
provided free of charge to the infected person in the
past.  They should not be entitled to 
an 
award for
future care, as the arrangements for this have to be in
the hands of the infected person."
This is 
an
 alternative
 -- 
in terms of past care,
an
 alternative to the care claim 
being
 made by the
eligible infected person
.  
If that's not done
, 
the
eligible affected person can claim for 
a
 degree of
compensation
 -- 

--Result #456--

Well, 
it might be but that would probably apply to many
other diseases.  If you go back that far
, 
I'm afraid
I remember that having 
a
 disabled baby might carry
a 
stigma 
and 
there wasn't necessarily 
a
 willingness to
undertake those tasks there.  You could say there was
a
 shortage of carers
.  
There probably was and 
probably
is today people who are prepared to be paid to do these
jobs
.  
We know 
that
 
is
 the case.
Again
, 
it
's
 
a
 question of where you draw 
a
 line,
both in Common Law, where it is called remoteness, how
remote is the claim that's 
being
 made from the injury
,
and I think what influences that to some extent is
partly 
a
 
sort of 
policy issue, we
've got
 to have 
a
 limit
on how much 
by way of damages 
is had 
generally
.  But
it
's
 actually partly on the 
fact the 
further away you
get from the direct needs of the individual infected
 
30
person, the more random are the circumstances that
surround what actually happened
, 
and it
's
 remote in the
sense that in legal terms it
's
 thought to be 
not
reasonably foreseeable, all these 
different
circumstances, and it
's
 
sort of
 unfair to 
ask the
tortfeasor, the person who has been negligent, to 
pay in
this random way.
So that's 
a
 policy decision that the law takes in
relation to those
, 
and it seems to me that it would
probably be wrong for 
a
 compensation scheme like this to
take 
a
 different approach
.  
But
,
 again
,
 I absolutely
accept that 
a
 different view could be taken.

--Result #457--

Those are the questions I want to ask about
recommendation 9.
I have no specific additional question in relation
to recommendation 10
, 
which I think probably pulls
together 
a
 lot of what we
've
 already discussed.  We can
just 
go back to the text of it
, 
for the sake of
completeness,
 at page 37.
So your 
recommendation 10 was:
"... [the] 
framework of 
tariff based compensation
... at rates which broadly reflect 
comparable rates of
common law damages and other 
UK 
compensation schemes 
...
assessed basis for defined financial losses.  The
factors described in this report should inform the
matters for which compensation is awarded
.  The rates of
compensation should be based on the advice of the
independent clinical and 
legal panels."
So I think 
recommendation 10 
essentially 
pulls
together
 a number of the earlier recommendations.

--Result #458--

Yes.  Can I make one other point
, 
which is 
that 
one of
the things I learned looking at other schemes
, 
and again
in 
particular
 perhaps the 9/11 scheme, which was part of
the trust and confidence which was generated by that
scheme was the fact that it did not 
insist
 on 
a
 waiver
of the right to litigate on the basis that it was the
intention of the scheme so to provide something
sufficiently generous that people would not feel it was
necessary to do that
, 
and in that case it worked 
I think
100 per cent
.
Now, 
of course
, 
you can achieve that result by
paying so much 
more 
money that it 
w
ould be ridiculous to
go to 
court, 
and I'm certainly not recommending that
approach
, 
but I do think 
that 
it makes this 
a
 more
consensual process
, 
and one would hope that compensation
awarded would by and large satisfy people that they had
no need to litigate at least in order for the purpose of
getting damages.  I can see there might be other reasons
 
43
to litigate
.

--Result #459--

Yes
.  
Well
, 
clearly what I'm saying is that should,
having received 
a
 compensation award
, 
an
 applicant
proceed with litigation in which damages were claimed
for the same subject matter?  And
, 
for instance
,
a
 personal injury which was identical to the personal
injury included in the impact award, that that
 -- 
in
calculating
 any award of damages that the receipt of
that award should be taken into account, in other words
damages should be reduced by that amount
.

--Result #460--

I think what is true here
, 
which perhaps isn't
particularly apparent here, obviously it
's
 the state who
would be providing the compensation.  It might or might
not be the state who is the defendant in subsequent
litigation
, 
but my recommendation would be whoever is
the defendant or paying party in litigation would be
able to claim
, 
as it were
, 
the credit for what was in
the compensation scheme where the claim was for the same
subject matter
.

--Result #461--

But
,
 of course
,
 there may be elements of 
a
 claim that
could be brought by 
an individual through litigation
which are distinct from what is set out in your
compensation scheme
, 
and those would be unaffected
?

--Result #462--

Then 
recommendation 11(c
):
"
the availability of 
an 
award under the scheme
should be 
a
 factor 
to 
which the court could have regard
when
 determining liability for costs in any court
proceedings 
related to the infection."
 

12 July 2022
          
          

  45
Again, just to 
try 
to 
unpick and understand that, if
a
 person chose not to make 
an
 application to the
compensation scheme but to litigate and 
thereby
 incur
legal costs, is the suggestion that the court could but
wouldn't have to say
, 
well
, 
you are not going to get all
your costs
 -- 

--Result #463--

-- 
because you could have got the same from making
an
 application under the compensation scheme
?

--Result #464--

It
's
 already 
a
 feature of how courts award legal costs
that the court will take into account or can take into
account the conduct of the claimant
, 
and 
indeed
 the
defendant for that matter, 
but 
here 
what's
 relevant 
is
the claimant, in the lead
-
up to the proceedings and
,
therefore
,
 it seemed to me that
, 
in those circumstances,
say
 
a
 claimant had decided not to go for 
an
 award of
compensation at all but just for damages, the court
might want to look at -- it wouldn't have to decide it
adversely to the claimant but it would want to be able
to look in justice at whether the claim could more
conveniently have been made under the scheme.  But also
someone who has got 
an
 award under the scheme who then
proceeds
 anyway to litigate, if, for instance, they
,
quote
,
 
"won" their 
litigation, but the difference -- the
excess
,
 as it were
,
 in terms of damages was really
 
46
small
, 
the court might want to look at whether it is
proportionate behaviour to bring the litigation at all.
So the idea of this is in general and it is not just
in this respect, 
but 
the costs regime is designed to
make people think twice and preferably 
a
 lot more than
twice 
before
 litigating in any event but particularly in
those sort of circumstances
.

--Result #465--

You set out the arguments
,
 as it were
,
 for and against
either 
an
 uplift or inflation or the payment of interest
in 9.124 and 9.125.
Then over the page
, 
at 9.126
, 
you say:
"Nonetheless, I consider that the effect of
inflation must be recognised either by 
an 
award of
interest, or by 
an
 uplift by reference to 
an
 inflation
index.  This does not
, however, 
apply to lump sums
awards 
awarded for non
-
financial losses
 (
apart from 
the
past value of care
), 
where the award is made at the
value of applicable at the date of the award.
"
So you recommend that either -- and 
we see in
9.127
 -- 
this is effectively reflected in the terms of
recommendation 13, 
interest or 
an
 uplift 
for 
inflation
.
If the compensation scheme is put into effect and
adopts this recommendation, in terms of the interest
 
55
rate, you haven't
, 
I think
, 
made 
a
 specific
recommendation as to what the interest rate should be
,
other than referring to what the position is in personal
injury claims in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

--Result #466--

-- 
and again in part 
that
 
is
 due to -- I mean
, 
I'm not
for 
a
 moment saying there aren't people in all
categories who have
,
 as it were
,
 
an
 urgent need for
money
, 
but part of it is due to how simple or otherwise
it is to determine what would be 
an
 appropriate amount
to award actually.  The thing about 
an
 interim payment
is that you don't want to pay more than -- 
I mean, 
in
the extreme case you don't want to pay more than what it
turns out 
a
 person is entitled to because that leads to
obvious complications
.  
And in the court setting an
interim payment will generally speaking be no more than
the very minimum that someone might be expected to get
in 
a
 
particular
 circumstance
, 
and so there is already
a
 heavy discount involved in that
.
 
58
It does seem to me that both for the living affected
and the deceased infected, firstly, without wishing
to -- understanding the dangers of over
-
generalisation
the needs are not so urgent.  The urgency of the need
I identify for the eligible living infected is that many
of them are worried about dying before they have any
idea whether they are going to get compensation or not
and not 
being
 able to settle their affairs.  That is not
a
 need, 
a
 shared -- 
in quite 
the same way 
by
 the estate
by someone who has already died or by an affected
person.
So 
I start with the point of view 
that 
this is
utterly exceptional with the idea that you have
an
 interim payment before the scheme is set 
up
 and the
rules are explored and known
, 
but happily there is
a
 means by which such payments can be made already
because there are support schemes.  There is
an
 administration.  There is 
an
 identity available as to
who is eligible and
,
 therefore
,
 it
's
 partly the ease of
identification 
and 
also partly because 
of 
the very
striking need of this very narrowly defined
 -- quite
narrowly defined 
group of people.

--Result #467--

Can I just explore one or two additional points with you
arising out of that.  By only making interim payments to
those infected who are still alive, that may continue to
 
59
leave those who receive no support at all, 
an
 example
might be parents who's child died or children in some
cases died, waiting longer for any form of compensation
and that may in fact -- they may never live to see that,
bearing 
in 
mind
 that they may be of 
an
 older generation
.
Any reflections on that?

--Result #468--

I think you could make 
a
 case of varying degrees of
compelling -- necessary compulsion 
for virtually
everyone who could make 
a
 claim.  There's no doubt that
everybody who as
pires
 to receiv
ing
 compensation will
want the matter settled as soon as possible.  That's
part of the underlying reason for many of the
recommendations I
've
 made.
What I'm seeking to address here is 
a
 very
particular
 need.  I would agree that the longer it takes
for there to be 
a
 response, the urgency in relation to
the group I
've
 identified gets greater.  There
's
 no
doubt, by definition
.  
And I'm not sure I 
could
 say that
applies
 -- there is 
an
 existing need to settle things
that everyone else shares
, 
but I'm not persuaded myself
that that falls
 into
 -- that more people then fall into
this category
.
And, 
as I said, the wider you draw the category, the
less easy it will be for the government, I suspect, to
identify what they would consider to be the appropriate
 

12 July 2022
          
          

  61
figure to pay
.
  So, actually it might be slightly
self
-
defeating in the sense that they talk about
complexity
, 
and I acknowledge there is complexity in
everything 
in 
this report
, 
as your question
demonstrate
s
,
 and the idea of this was that it would be
something that -- maybe I'm 
being
 naive, it should be
quite simple to make 
a
 decision about,
 
can 
I 
put it that
way
?

--Result #469--

I anticipate there may be some further questions that
people will want me to ask in relation to that but
I will wait and see, rather than ask you anything
further on recommendation
 
14 at this stage.
Could we go then to recommendation 15
, 
which is
page 38
.  Thank you, Lawrence.
We can go through
, 
I think
, 
some of it pretty
quickly but there are 
a
 handful of points I wanted to
just explore further.  The first point is:
"
a) 
in assessing compensation 
... 
no account should
be taken of any past payments made under the support
schemes or their predecessors."
As I understand it
, 
that includes any past payments
made from the Macfarlane Special Payments 
No.
 
2
 Trust,
which was the amounts paid following the
1990/1991
 
settlement of the HIV Haemophilia Litigation
?

--Result #470--

Then
:
"b) the 
current annual payment under the support
scheme
s
 should be continued 
(
or merged into the
compensation scheme
) 
and guaranteed for life
, 
by
legislation or secured government undertaking.
"
Just 
picking up that point of undertaking
, 
you have
suggested that one way of giving that security is
a
 formal undertaking by Her Majesty's Government that
these will continue for life
?

--Result #471--

When you say the payments under the support schemes
could be merged into the compensation scheme
, 
does that
effectively mean the 
compensation scheme, the 
arm's
length body
, 
would take over the administration of the
existing 
-- (overspeaking) -- 

--Result #472--

Yes, I have been fairly sketchy by design, 
if 
not
encouraged
, 
I think
, 
really
, 
by the terms of reference
to go into the weeds of the administration, but it 
does
seem
 
to me 
that if it the support 
payments are to
continue and there is going to be 
a
 compensation scheme
and 
there is going to be 
a
 relationship between the two,
it makes sense for the administration of both to be

We have already
, 
I think
, 
addressed
recommendation
 
15(c), the taking into account
of
 
payments for the future in terms of assessing future
financial loss or care provision
, 
and I don't propose
to
 
ask you anything further at this stage about
 
66
(e)
 
and
 
(f
), 
tax
, but 
I do want to ask you a little more
about the position in relation to benefits.
Could we go to page 116.
So, at paragraph 9.90 you say
 -- 
and this is having
set out
, 
as we have seen
, 
your recommendation of
an
 uplift in the annual support payments and the
tax
-
free sum for additional financial issues
 -- 
you say
at 9.90:
"I recommend that in exchange for the lifetime
guarantee of this increased annual sum, uprated annually
for inflation ... such payments should be taken into
account in the assessment of entitlement to any means
tested state benefits.  The payments should still be
disregarded against any entitlement to non-means tested
benefits such as disability living allowance."
Then if we could turn to page 129
, 
you set out in
paragraph 10.10 the current position
, 
which is
:
"... 
a
 range of means
-
tested benefits 
administered
by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) discount
infected blood scheme payments for the purposes 
of
calculating
 
a
 beneficiary's income or capital
 ...
"
Then you set out the DWP benefits to which the
exemption relates.
Then you say 
that:
"[You] 
recommend 
that this
 
exemption 
continue
s to
 
67
apply to the annual payments that continue to be made
under the 
support schemes, or their equivalent under
the 
compensation scheme."
Is there 
a
 contradiction between paragraphs 9.90 and
10.10 or have I misunderstood?

--Result #474--

Can I then move to recommendation 16 through to 19.
So page 39
, 
please
, Lawrence
.
Sir
, 
I just to read them out and then I want to pick
up
,
 again
,
 on 
a
 handful of issues relating to them.
 

12 July 2022
          
          

  69
Recommendation 16
, 
the recommendation of the
:
"... 
Arms Length Body ... to administer the
compensation scheme, with guaranteed independence of
judgment 
and accountable directly to Parliament for the
expenditure of public funds and the fulfillment of its
terms of reference ..."

--Result #475--

Then:
"
b) a 
financial and advice and support services to
assist
 recipient
 in the management of awards and in
accessing financial services; and
"c) facilitation of access to 
appropriate health,
care and counselling services."
We may want to come back to that.
"
Recommendation 18:
"... 
the compensation scheme should be delivered
locally within each devolved nation.  Consideration
should be given by the UK and devolved governments to
entering 
an
 agreement under which 
either a partnership
board is created to oversee the compensation scheme's
ALB, into which the administration of the local support
schemes 
be merged
, 
or the ALB commissions or delegates
the local administration of the compensation scheme to
the devolved support schemes."
 
71
Pausing there, are there two features that one draws
from this and from the contents of your report?
Firstly, that the compensation scheme, whatever form it
takes, whatever the levels might be, should be a UK
-
wide
scheme
?

--Result #476--

Well, 
I looked at this really from the applicant's point
of view
, 
where it seemed to me absolutely essential that
they have 
a
 local -- that service of this compensation
 
72
scheme is delivered to them locally and
, 
in many cases,
as I have already indicated
, 
personally
.  
And I was very
struck by the value that was placed by many people
I saw
, 
particularly from Scotland
, 
because there were
a
 lot of people from Scotland
, but also from 
Ireland and
Wales
, that 
they appreciated that local connection and
the ability of locally
-
based administrators to
understand the context in which people were coming to
them.  I think that
,
 therefore
,
 is really important
.
And
, you know, 
if we are talking about England,
obviously it is 
a
 larger place and one would 
imagine one
would 
have to make 
a
 decision
, 
if you were administering
it, 
whether you would have 
more than -- 
the ability to
access service from cities other than London
, 
frankly.

--Result #477--

Then picking up on recommendation
 
17
 
again
, 
and the
reference to support services.
If we go to page 139
, please.  
So this is the issue of legal support.
Again
, 
this is 
a
 matter which
, 
I think for the very
reasons you articulate here
, 
is 
a
 matter of some
importance
, of
 concern to those present.
So you say:
"
It is 
inevitable that the scheme be complex for
many applicants to understand, to prepare their case for
compensation and to respond to 
an
 offer
 
or assessment of
compensation.  If, as they did, the Home Affairs
Committee
 considered the Windrush scandal victims
 
80
required legal support, it is difficult to see how the
same conclusion cannot be reached for the victims of the
infected blood scandal."
And 
you set out 
a
 number of reasons why that might
be the case
, 
and you outline the kind of advice and
assistance at different stages that individuals might
need in order to be able to access the compensation
scheme fairly
.
If we go 
then 
to paragraph 12.2, the next paragraph
,
you say it 
could
 be provided in one
,
 or both
,
 of two
ways
: "
support unit staffed by lawyers and paralegals"
.
So part of the scheme but independent of those
undertaking the assessment
; 
is that right?  Is that what
the first bullet point --

--Result #478--

That completes what I wanted to ask you about the -- for
present purposes in any event -- the recommendations
themselves.  I
've just got
 
a
 handful of other points
that have been suggested to me
, 
which I haven't picked
up on along the way
.
One of the features of the scheme that we
've
discussed and 
that 
you
've
 referred to in your report is
that for some aspects of the compensation there might be
the tariff payments
, 
but there might be circumstances in
which there should be 
a
 more bespoke assessment in
certain respects.  Would that be 
a
 choice for the
individual
, 
do you think?

--Result #479--

There will be clearly instances in which, whether it is
to establish eligibility or to elucidate the claim
itself for one aspect or other of the compensation
awards, where individuals are going to need to either
collate medical information from their records or
potentially have in some instances medical reports
,
although
, 
as I understand
, 
your recommendation, medical
reports are not 
an
 integral part of the scheme, 
indeed
to some extent you are trying to avoid that.  But if
there is 
a
 need in 
an
 individual case to get 
a
 medical
report or obtain medical records
, 
would it be right to
understand that your expectation is that the costs of
doing it will be borne by the scheme
?

--Result #480--

I'm afraid I think transparency goes two ways in that
if
 -- 
I mean, 
I appreciate these are
 
sensitive
 --
sensitive 
personal information -- but
 I
 -- obviously
what the scheme needs is whatever is relevant to the
claim for compensation and nothing else, but one can
envisage that sensitive information that 
an
 applicant
 
87
would rather not be disclosed would actually be relevant
to the determination of the award
, 
and
 
it seems to me
that I see no 
particular
 justification why that should
not be -- the scheme should not have access to that
information should 
a
 person elect to make 
a
 claim.

--Result #481--

Then if we go to recommendation 17
, 
paragraph (c
),
that's the recommendation that the support services
through the scheme should include
:
"c) 
facilitation of access 
to
 appropriate health
,
care and counselling services.
"
If we could go on to page 137.  I have been asked to
ask you a little more about that and I just want to look
at what's said at paragraph 11
.
32
, 
first of all.  Under
the heading "Non
-
Financial Support"
:
"The scheme should have 
a
 support unit which is
available to provide or arrange the provision of
medical, psychological and social support to infected
and affected persons appropriate to the needs caused by
the consequences of the infection.  The Archer Inquiry
recommended that the infected should be issued with
a
 card entitl
ing
 them to benefits not freely available
under the NHS, including free prescriptions,
counselling, physiotherapy and support services
.  This
recommendation should be revisited and consideration
given to whether such a scheme or comparable facility
 
88
should be provided via the administration of 
the
compensation scheme or otherwise."
Just picking up on that latter point
, 
first of all,
the re-visiting of the recommendation of the
Archer
 
Inquiry
, 
is that something you are suggesting the
Department of Health should be doing or something that's
for
 -- 
the arm's length body 
have
 set up to consider
?

--Result #482--

This emanates partly from the 
Archer 
Inquiry but also
from my understanding that something similar to that
actually happens in Ireland
, 
and there it is not -- I do
not think it is 
a
 matter that the Tribunal Service does
but there is 
a
 card which gives people -- 
and 
obviously
they have 
a
 different system of health care which
entitles people to benefits they wouldn't otherwise
readily get here
.
What I have 
an
 impression of
, 
and I have by no means
looked at all the evidence that might be relevant to
this that the Inquiry will have
, 
is that there are
certain aspects of support currently provided, whether
it be way of actual care or counselling or support
services
, 
which is not coordinated and is difficult for
people in some places to identify.  I was also impressed
by the fact that some of the devolved nations do provide
sometimes 
a
 
bit
 of
, in
 ad hoc
 way, support to people
about things like financial 
advice
 and services and
 

12 July 2022
          
          

  89
things of that nature
.
What I'm seeking to suggest is there is
a
 combination of needs that this 
particular
 group has
,
which is rather different probably from that of other
people who suffer from other illnesses
, 
and there is
a
 need for 
an
 understanding of what it is about these
awful
 infections and the social consequences of them
that shouldn't have to be repeated 
every time 
to someone
in order for them to understand what support this
individual needs
.
So 
it struck me there should be an investigation
into whether in effect individuals can be issued with
a
 card which at least will tell the reader of that card
who provides 
a
 service that these are people who are
entitled to it without having to repeat 
a
 lot of
distressing
 history
.  
But also there needs to be
a
 facilitation of access to the multiplicity of services
that this 
particular
 group need.  Whether 
that
 
is
prepared by the Department of Health, NHS England or the
arm's length body or 
a
 combination of those, I think is
not for me to say
, 
but all I'm identifying here is
a
 need for signposting, for coordination of services and
for evidencing eligibility for services which isn't
being
 met in some cases in some places
, 
and one route to
that could be by way of the compensation scheme
 
90
organisation
.
So 
I emphasise something I 
think I 
may have said
yesterday
, 
which is to my 
mind
 compensation here isn't
just about money.  To put people as near as possible
back in the position they would have been without the
injury 
involved -- or 
should involve the state providing
all sorts of care targeted for these people.  It may
well be care 
that
 
is
 available and should be available
on the NHS or through social security
 or wherever
 else
,
but it
's
 not getting to everyone because of difficulties
of access and organisation
, 
and this group I believe is
large enough for 
a
 coordination
, 
as I believe there
probably is now in relation to the actual treatment of
the diseases.

--Result #483--

Then, I think the final points I wanted to pick up are
arising out of the issues that we have discussed is the
position in relation to Scotland.  You
,
 again
,
 quite
 
92
candid that you focused upon the guidance that can be
drawn from
, 
and the approach
 
to
, 
the assessment of
damages in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
, 
as
opposed to the distinct system in Scotland
.
There are aspects in which the Scottish system is
different.  There may be elements of compensation that
are more generous
,
 
for
 
example
,
 in Scotland.  I am not
going to go through specific details or examples
.  
But
would it be important
, 
do you think
, 
for the legal
panel, who would be potentially populating your grids or
tariffs with suggested amounts
 or
 bands of compensation
,
to include appropriate expertise from Scotland, almost
certainly Wales, Northern Ireland, England as well, but
reflecting the different nature of the legal system
in
 
Scotland
, 
to ensure that it is not 
a
 lowest common
denominator approach necessarily and 
that 
appropriate
regard is had 
to
 the way 
in which 
awards are structured
in 
Scotland
?

--Result #484--

Could I just add to that point
?  
We would have to bear
in 
mind
, 
and the panel would have to bear in 
mind
, this,
and I have said this before
, 
but we are talking about
categories of compensation 
being
 awarded
, 
which
,
I suspect
, 
are no more awardable in Scotland than they
are in England.  So one has to take into account the
rough with the smooth
 to some extent.

--Result #485--

Well
, 
if
 -- 
and obviously it is 
a
 big 
"
if
" -- 
the
principle of 
a
 compensation scheme were accepted, if
 --
and
,
 again
,
 it is 
a
 big
 "
if
" -- 
a
 framework along the
lines of that which I have recommended were considered
appropriate, you could, for instance, consider setting
up
, 
in shadow form
, 
an
 arm's length body.  You could
consider
, 
in shadow form
, 
setting up the panel
 -- 
or
,
 
95
less than shadow form
, 
probably, the panels
, 
to start
the work of considering some of the detail
, 
because
I absolutely accept that the work of those panels is
going to be quite complex.  It will require consultation
amongst 
other things, 
a
 lot of research
, 
and I 
don't
 see
that happening overnight.  Frankly
, if it'd -- been able
to do that overnight 
I might have considered doing it in
my own review
, 
but I couldn't.  
So we need -- and
I don't see that that sort of exercise needs to await
the outcome of this Inquiry.
But I completely understand it might be difficult to
go beyond that because
 -- 
but possibly
, 
and I speculate
,
would it be possible to -- having identified
,
 say
,
a
 range of awards potentially for injury
, 
you could
start thinking about that?
I think when it comes actually to making awards and
determinations though
, 
that
 
is
 probably the point at
which you have to 
stop
.  So the ability of 
a
 scheme in
shadow form to actually distribute money, apart from the
interim payment I think would be questionable
, 
and of
course I have not spoken to and 
wouldn't intend to speak
to the 
Treasury
, 
but I would be quite surprised if the
Treasury agreed to release money on that rather
speculative basis
.

--Result #486--

Well
, 
I think I would expect -- I hope
d -- frankly
outside
 my terms of reference
 -- that 
if there was
a
 change in the perception of the cut
-
off dates 
for,
say
, 
the support scheme, 
that
 that would be mirrored in
the compensation scheme
.  

--Result #487--

The 
third question now moves to issues of calculations
of financial loss.  Your report does not refer
explicitly to pensions but pension losses that can be
recovered in Common Law claims.  Should that be included
in appropriate cases in the calculation of financial
loss within the compensation scheme
?

--Result #488--

Then, again, picking up on that idea of people having
fought for compensation for decades, many having died
 
104
without it
, 
might that justify at least consideration of
a
 higher rate of interest on past loss
?

--Result #489--

Because the -- the payment of interest is there to
ensure that people receive compensation
,
 as it were
,
 in
today's values and so the compensation is what it is, it
is not 
a
 means which I would suggest 
should
 be used,
although they could be used in the court system,
I appreciate that, as 
a
 substitute for punitive damages.
If 
we
're
 going to have 
a
 punitive award for exemplary
damages or compensation let's have that and let's deal
with it on that basis, not I 
would 
suggest through
interest, which should be purely about making sure
people are not under compensated because of the length
of time that passed if they incurred 
a
 loss
.

--Result #490--

Yes
, 
and 
then 
I think 
a
 
further 
consideration of how you
would import that into 
a
 compensation system
.

--Result #491--

The next point is 
a
 point of clarification.  I think
when I was asking you about hepatitis B we touched on
the question of whether you had received representations
or information on the question of compensation 
for
infection with hepatitis B.  I took you
, 
I think
, 
to
a
 couple of passages in your report.  I wasn't proposing
to go back to that.  Is it right to understand from your
report
 -- 
this is how I read it but I may be wrong
 --
that in the oral meetings in
 -- 
which you conducted
,
hepatitis B was not raised but it was raised in at least
 
106
one
 set of -- (overspeaking) -- submissions?

--Result #492--

Can I then come to the question of the extent to which
compensation -- well, the extent to which 
monies
recovered through the settlement of previous claims
might be taken into account.

--Result #493--

You explained earlier
, 
and we looked at the relevant
part of your report
, 
that previous payments received
under any of the support schemes or their precursors you
would not envisage 
being
 taken into account
, 
and you
explained your reasoning in the report
, 
and they were
often described as ex gratia payments, they were
n't
compensation as such and so on
, 
and you confirmed 
that
that would also apply in 
relation to 
payments from the
Macfarlane Special Payments No. 2 Trust.
In terms 
then 
of any other settlements, your
statement I think -- sorry, your 
report I think suggests
that, if we look at, just by way of example,
paragraph 9.6
.  
I think it is page 95
, Lawrence
.
 
107
So 
paragraph 9.6
, I had
 ask
ed
 you about the first
part of it
,
 
potentially, but 
not the second.
You say fifth line down:
"
... 
any sum received in the settlement should be
taken into account as 
a
 deduction from any lump sum
award for past financial losses or provision of care, in
so
 
far as it can be identified what part of any
settlement was attributable to such losses or
provision."
Is this correct, leaving aside
,
 as I say
,
 all the
various incarnations of the support schemes and
ex
 
gratia payments, if there was something that was
the
 
payment of compensation as part of either 
a
 court
award -- 
well, 
sorry
, 
if as part of 
a
 court award
, 
it
would presumably identify what it was referable to
.

--Result #494--

And then could fall to be taken into account against the
relevant item of compensation under the scheme.
If it is 
a
 settlement, is this right, 
it would --
you would envisage it would be taken into account but
only insofar as you can identify from the settlement
that it or part of it is referable to 
a
 
particular
 head
of loss
?

--Result #495--

Yes.  All those features, sir, would
,
 of course
,
 lead to
a
 reduction in what might otherwise have been
anticipated would be claimed.  That doesn't necessarily
mean that justice or fairness might not require at least
to look to see whether it would be right and proper to
take the payment into account when
,
 as it were
,
 one
might describe as proper 100 per cent compensation is
now 
being
 offered.  
But 
I appreciate -- 
and, 
of course
,
there are these difficulties and they could end up by
being
 difficulties where proportionality would mean it
would be actually wiser and fairer and 
a
 better use of
resource not to make the argument at all.  But I don't
think I could properly looking at the -- balancing the
interests of those claiming things and those paying for
them not say that it should not be taken into account at
all.

--Result #496--

  
Just picking up on that, 
a
 specific area
I have been asked to raise with you.  I appreciate much
may 
depend
 upon the individual case
 
but whilst it might
be proportionate
,
 
for
 
example
,
 if there is still
an
 existing settlement agreement or 
a
 court approval to
look at that and see whether you 
could
 identify 
a
 head
of loss that was comparable to that for which the
compensation was 
being
 sought
, 
but you wouldn't in
general expect there
,
 
for
 
example
,
 to be 
an
 attempt to
interrogate litigation files and look at whether there
were notes of settlement meetings and try to reconstruct
what might have been in the minds of those --

--Result #497--

My sympathies are entirely with such people but actually
the issue you raise could be said to exist in relation
to any eligible affected person as well.  And there will
be many in that category who are elderly or would like
to sort out their affairs.  But I'm 
dealing -- or
seeking to address 
a
 situation unfortunately where there
is no compensation scheme in existence, where the level
of assessment available without the scheme to assess who
should get what is very limited 
indeed
.
What I have suggested
, 
and I repeat it
, 
is
an
 exceptional measure to recognise 
a
 group of people
who are alive, who have been personally directly
 

12 July 2022
          
          

  117
infected
, 
and I think 
that
 
is
 something which separates
them from even widows and widowers of infected people
who have died, who are
, 
I believe
 
in this sense
, 
and
maybe this sense only
, 
in the same category as any other
eligible person who understandably
, 
and I am sure
virtually 
everyone in these categories whatever they
are
, 
want to sort things out as quickly as possible so
they can dispose of the -- sort out their own lives and
indeed
 sort out everyone else's lives as well.
Unfortunately 
a
 line
, 
in my view
, 
has to be drawn
somewhere
 
and
 -- 
just in terms of the practicalities of
it
, 
and I sought to suggest something which is simple,
entirely in line with -- in effect
, 
just asking the
people who run the support scheme to sign another
cheque
, 
notionally
, 
and I'm not sure 
that
 
is
 the case 
in
relation to anyone 
other than the category 
I've
mentioned
.

--Result #498--

Well
, 
I think what I'm seeking to reflect is not
actually a 
mitigation of loss but the effect of 
a
 policy
which is in legal cases applied to provide some line to
define what is thought to be fair to require 
a
 paying
tortfeasor
, 
wrongdo
er
 
they have 
to pay for and 
what 
not,
and there always has to be such 
a
 line.  It is by no
means -- to say it is mitigation would 
be to 
suggest I'm
implicitly seeking to criticise those who care for their
loved ones and
,
 of course
,
 I'm not doing any such thing
.
But the legal logic that regards care costs is to be
valued on the 
costs of -- the 
notional costs of the
care, rather than the financial loss is where 
a
 line is
drawn.  As 
a
 barrister
, 
I would be very happy to go to
court in such 
a
 case and seek to argue that the line
should be drawn somewhere else
, 
and I suspect people do
that all the time
, 
but I'm not aware that they have yet
succeeded
, 
but it does seem to me that what I'm looking
at here is the need for 
a
 degree of parity between
those -- in 
an
 area where it is directly comparable
 

12 July 2022
          
          

  121
between those who have 
a
 claim for negligence against
the whole service in 
a
 more routine way and someone who
has 
a
 claim for compensation here in relation to
something they are getting free of the obligation to
litigate.

--Result #499--

That
's
, I think I would be right in saying, 
a
 novel
concept
, 
and it is seeking to compensate something
different to that which the principle of compensation is
for.  In other words, you compensate 
an
 injured person
for
 the consequential loss to them of what they would
have earned themselves.  
It is -- 
again, I would hazard
a
 guess, and I'm happy to be shown to be wrong by
 
122
cleverer lawyers than I
, but that 
that would not be
admitted as 
a
 claim in 
an
 ordinary litigation claim for
the reasons
,
 really
,
 largely 
that I have
 explained
.

--Result #500--

I'm not in any way
,
 sir
,
 seeking to suggest that that is
not theoretically 
a
 way in which one could approach
this.  What I was seeking to do was to point to what
I believed to be the legal position with the recovery of
damages, that cost of care is
,
 generally speaking
,
limited to the commercial cost
, 
for reasons of
 --
in
 
effect
 for 
reasons of policy
, 
and if it not be the
case, then the 
answer
 to your question is much easier.
But if it is the case
, 
then there is 
an
 issue whether
parity requires us to follow the same approach in
a
 compensation case scheme such as this.
Not to do so would mean, if one went along the loss
of earnings route, that there would be considerable
disparity between what individuals in this scheme would
receive for -- in relation to exactly the same care each
of them has had.
So anyone who needed five
 
hours care 
a
 week, it
doesn't matter what it is, some will find it is limited
to commercial rate because their carer wasn't in work,
whereas others might be receiving very large sums of
money 
indeed
 because
, 
for the reasons you mention
, 
it
was not unreasonable for them to give up their job.  
So
that brings with it its own set of problems
.

But it would be -- 
as it happened
, 
for reasons I have

  129
never quite understood actually, the practice of
awarding -- asking for periodical payments in personal
injury cases, it is usually about anticipated costs such
as care rather than loss of earnings
, 
and I think the
reason for that is largely that many people and their
advisers prefer to have the compensation for loss of
earnings as 
a
 lump sum because they are then free to
invest it and use it in ways which provide more benefit
to them
, 
because the loss of earnings aspect is that
discretionary part of life where you need 
the 
freedom of
how 
is it 
you spend your earnings
.  Whereas 
care costs,
equipment costs and the like 
tend to be things you know
you're going to need, therefore -- and you know you're
going to need them on a regular basis, so it's
 
an
 aspect
of autonomy but it is 
a
 matter of choice.
All I'm saying here is if you are providing it as
a
 lump sum
, 
then the well trodden methods of 
calculating
those in personal injury cases should be used
.

--Result #502--

Well, 
maybe the Inquiry might wish to make
an
 observation about that.  
Because 
I have said
 --
I mean, 
clearly, clinically necessary treatment and
screening should be made available free of charge to
this group of people.  
Then 
if that's not done
generally
, 
then it should be done as part of the
compensation scheme.

--Result #503--

It could still come within (f).  
I mean, 
subject to the
evidence and fulfilling those requirements.  But the
reason for having (f) on my list was to cover
 
136
a
 multitude of cases.  The one thing 
I think 
people
probably ought to understand, it is quite impossible
,
even if I had had two years to do this
, or, if I may say
so, 
as long as Sir Brian has to do
, 
to describe every
single circumstance that might cover compensation or
might be covered by compensation.  One has to have
,
 in
any event
,
 broad categories.  The choice you then have
to make is whether you have 
a
 bespoke assessment in
every single case or you put 
these
 together to provide
some sort of broad justice 
and -- 
but certainly the
example you provide
, 
I would expect that suffering to be
recognised as 
being
 the suffering of someone who is
an
 eligible affected person, probably in category (f)
.

--Result #504--

If it's my opinion that matters, no.  
I believe the
fairness 
of -- 
the parity between all these people who
have been injured by -- in 
an
 avoidable way by 
an
 agency
of the UK government should receive compensation based
on the same criterion
.

--Result #505--

One reason it
's
 not possible fully to 
answer
 your
question
,
 sir
,
 is I certainly 
don't -- 
have not been
able to establish
, 
and I don't know if it is possible to
establish
, 
how many -- the base point
, which is 
how many
infected people there are.  I am sure it is known how
many infected people there are who have been eligible to
the scheme
, 
to 
one 
or other of the support schemes
,
which would be 
a
 starting point
, 
but what I don't 
think
is establish
able -- it 
may
 
be by your Inquiry, I don't
know
 -- is 
even 
an
 estimate of how many others 
there 
are
out there who are unknown about
.
But it may be possible to produce 
a
 figure and
 --
with 
a
 
bit
 of estimation as to how many primary
 
150
claimants, whether alive or now deceased
, 
there are
 
and
from that it might be possible to make 
an
 estimation
.
Again
, 
it 
would 
have to be averages on how many eligible
affected people there are
.
I did give the example from the vCJD trust where
there was one case reported by the trustee where they
were looking at 88 eligible people in relation to one
claimant and one -- that impressed me sufficiently in
relation to having -- feeling there needed to be some
care 
about
 the drawing up of who is eligible as
an affected person
.
So 
I think it might be possible
, 
but beyond my
knowledge
, 
to still come up with 
a
 number
, 
roughly.  The
experience of the Irish scheme is that
 -- and 
it
affects
 -- 
several hundred cases 
a
 year 
are
 process
ed
out of some thousands
, 
and the scheme has now been going
really quite some time.  Obviously it is 
a
 question of
what resource was put into the scheme, how quickly one
does this.  But it would seem to me that any sensible
administration setting this out would need to understand
that this has to be 
a
 front loaded event.  The staff and
the resources you need at the beginning are going to be
considerably greater than they will be later on
.
But, certainly there will have to be 
a
 queue and
that does give rise
 -- well, firstly, it does give rise
 
151
to another issue about
, 
in addition
 
to the immediate
interi
m 
payment
 
I'm suggesting now, whether there should
be 
a
 process of interim payment further down the line
.
Which there could be.  I haven't suggested that but
there's no reason why you couldn't do that
.  
But that in
itself 
then adds
 another layer of process to what you
do
, 
and so it will take time.
But one has to consider the alternatives
, 
and the
alternative
 
is no scheme at all and leaving people to
their own devices
, 
and 
that
 
is
,
 no doubt
,
 even less
desirable in terms.  Some might have litigation
prospects
, 
some might not.  Whatever those are, that
would undoubtedly be 
a
 longer process than any
compensation scheme would offer
.
So I think -- 
I haven't answered your question
directly as to how long because the simple 
answer
 is
I don't know because it depends on the number of
variables, but it is undoubtedly going to take 
a
 long
time
.

 -- a document that I think we looked at yesterday. 
This was provided because a line to take had been 
requested by the Chancellor in respect of the autum n 
statement on haemophiliacs and AIDS.  If we could t urn 
to the second page, please, paragraphs 5 and 6.  Th is 
is the section that is "Not For Use" but is for 
background information for the minister, and I'll r ead 
through.  What was written is this: 
"I understand that Mr Clarke will be considering 
the matter at an internal meeting tomorrow.  He is  
80 said to be sceptical about the NIT for any further 
payment (the Trust still has £8 [million] in the 
kitty), but Mrs Bottomley is said to think that the
Government must be seen to be doing more.  The outc ome 
is likely to be a further payment of perhaps 
£5 [million] to the Trust next year, to be found fr om 
within the agreed provision for 1990-91. 
"An out-of-court settlement would be quite 
a different matter.  Although [Department of Health ]
could probably settle more cheaply than if they wer e 
to lose the case, the cost would still be at least 
£100-200 [million].  The legal advice is in any cas e 
that the NHS is not liable, and the action for 
compensation is unlikely to be successful. 
An out-of-court settlement would also raise the 
prospect of no-fault compensation generally for 
victims of medical accidents, which could be very 
expensive indeed, and raise difficult questions abo ut 
why, if liability is not admitted, this group of AI DS 
victims deserves compensation but others do not." 
So that is the Treasury position set out in the 
minute.  The meeting that took place on 14 November
internally in the Department of Health, I say for t he 
record that neither the Inquiry nor your legal team
have been able to find any minutes of that meeting,                                  
 
                             1 but do you think it is a reasonable assumption that
such a meeting did take place, if not on 14 Novembe r, 
then around that time?

--Result #507--
 That's, in part, the case, because the resource was  so 
tight.  I mean, our spend -- I think 12 per cent of
the national wealth on health -- we spent 4.5 per c ent 
of the national wealth on health, at that time.  So
it's a much lower amount.  And you heard from 
John Major the economy was in a very difficult 
situation.  So we were constrained. 
The concern about no-fault compensation,
I think, was much broader than that, so it was part ly 
that it would eat up the budget, but there were mor e 
complex factors than that, for example concerning t he 
Committee on Safety of Medicines and the Licensing 
Authority.  If you say that treatment or products t hat 
are produced according to the best available eviden ce  
100 at the time can subsequently be regarded as subject  of 
negligence, then that is a really slippery slope, a nd 
it would have led to more restrictive prescribing, 
maybe worries that people wouldn't want to serve on
some of these committees. 
There is another argument that no-fault 
compensation would reduce the quality of medical 
practice, I'm not sure about that, but some argue i t. 
I mean, there were any number of reasons why the 
no-fault compensation route wasn't one that we coul d 
embark on.  And, of course, they'd had the 
Pearson Commission in '78, which it's one of those 
ideas when you start you think "This sounds very 
good", and the more you look at it you realise it's
fraught with difficulty and, as Graham Hart says la ter 
on, in New Zealand, where it had been introduced, i t 
was actually paying out very low figures.  So I nev er 
think people should, you know, pursue an idea becau se,
theoretically, it's going to be a much greater 
improvement.  Just be quite sure the option you're 
going for is actually an improvement on the status 
quo.

--Result #508--
 In the discussion section, I won't go all of the wa y 
through it, but Mr Dobson sets out reasons for not 
settling, and he says those will be consistent with
some modest additional help, is the phrase that he 
uses, through the Macfarlane Trust. 
But it also gives ministers an opportunity to 
review the present approach and sets out various 
options, including a unilateral announcement of an 
ex gratia payment, behind the scenes negotiations t o 
find a level of ex gratia payment that would mean t hat 
most of the plaintiffs dropped their case, and also
raised was the possibility of a commission of inqui ry 
to look into the question at least of compensation and 
possibly also of fact as well. 
If we turn -- the costs are then set out at 
paragraph 16 of the minutes, on page 7.
Then if we turn, please, to page 8, and the  
108 conclusions, and I think this is the section that y ou 
were referring to earlier in your evidence. 
What Mr Dobson wrote is this: 
"18.  Officials have found it difficult to reach 
a consensus view on what is a fairly unpalatable se t 
of options.  There is clearly no certainty that any  of 
the options outlined in [paragraphs] 12-15 would be
effective in 'ring-fencing' any further special 
treatment for the haemophiliacs.  However, the 
haemophiliacs have caught the public sympathy and 
there are grounds for arguing that their precise 
circumstances - a high degree of harm which cannot be 
clearly linked to the negligence of any agency - ar e 
unlikely to be repeated in any other group.  Minist ers 
will need to judge whether the political costs of 
maintaining the present line outweigh the risks of 
setting an expensive precedent if some further 
easement is offered."

Sir Christopher France, the Permanent Secretary sen t 
a minute to Mr Waldegrave's Private Office, again 
stressing the importance of the ringfence around th e 
payments towards people with haemophilia, and says at 
end of that quotation: 
"I advise long reflection before we move further 
into no-fault compensation for medical accidents." 
The language is perhaps reminiscent of 
Yes Minister , but are we right to read this as the 
grade 2 within the Department of Health and then th e 
Permanent Secretary urging very careful considerati on 
to be given by the minister to the policy that he w as 
proposing?

 Just before we leave the topic of the extension to 
transfusion patients and others, you mentioned the 
international compensation arrangements about which
you sought information in March 1990, but, as you s ay, 
140 that's obviously some time before the final extensi on 
was agreed. 
I won't take you to the documents for reasons of 
time, but I will put on the record that they are 
referred to at paragraph 4.125 of your statement. 
Having gone through those documents, the outcome 
seems to be that in Belgium and the Netherlands the re 
was no scheme at all of any form of payment. 
In France, there was a scheme for people with 
haemophilia, but not for others.  So that would see m 
to be a similar position to the UK at that time.  I n 
Ireland the same was true but with an expectation t hat 
an extension to people who did not have haemophilia
might be viewed favourably if cases were to emerge.

                             41 one claim for compensation which was currently befo re 
the court.
What effect did that information have on your 
thinking at the time?

 -- because you've -- well, you've got the thing up 
there. 
I mean, one of the great complexities about 
hep C was the second bullet: 
"- it would not be sensible to provide 
assistance to all those who have contracted [hep C]
since not all of those infected develop 
life-threatening complications. 
"- consideration would need to be given to 
potential 'triggers' for Government [assessment]."                                   
 
                             49 slippery slope towards no-fault compensation and th at 
is why the Treasury and others were so adamant that
the line had been defended.  There will therefore b e 
great resistance to any weakening of the line.
"'Having looked at no-fault compensation, I do 
think it is a destination to be avoided at almost a ny 
price.  It would be very expensive, and it would be
immensely difficult to devise such a scheme that wa s 
acceptable to the parties.  Such schemes are I beli eve 
no longer well regarded in other countries that hav e 
them, [example] New Zealand.
"'Any concession towards Hepatitis C victims 
would be very difficult and we should be vulnerable  to 
further demands on behalf of those suffering from 
other forms of Hepatitis, CJD etc etc, let alone fr om 
people suffering non-negligent harm eg in the cours e 
of surgery.  Mr Scofield has given some thought to 
this, but we would need to do a lot more work to se e 
whether a defensible and containable scheme could b e 
devised.  I have my doubts.
"'The logical position is that if one has been 
harmed through negligence, the law is available for
redress; if the harm is non-negligent and accidenta l,
then there may be substantial help available from t he 
statutory services (including social security) but  
150 there is no obligation on the government to provide
specific schemes of assistance.  The HIV/AIDS schem e 
is an exception to what is otherwise a pretty gener al 
rule and I think it may prove easier to differentia te 
between the HIV/AIDS cases and the rest (though 
I recognise the argument is not easy) than it is to
draw the line somewhere completely different. 
"'I think Ministers will certainly wish to 
discuss this very fully with officials before reach ing 
a view.'
"(4) Minute from Mr Sackville's Private Office 
to my Private Office dated 11 April 1995. 
Mr Sackville said that he had seen Mr Scofield's 
submission of 6 April; that he thought it was 
important that I was well briefed for a Cabinet 
discussion; and he thought that Mr Hart's paper (as
set out above) looked 'pretty decisive'.
"(5) A further minute from Mr Hart to Mr 
Malone's Office, dated 12 April 1995: 
"'I understand the [Minister of Health] has been 
invited to hold a meeting on this next Wednesday wh en 
I and a number of other officials involved are on 
leave. 
"'I do not need to repeat the difficulties that 
would arise over any decision to concede on payment s  
151 to those infected with Hepatitis C by blood 
transfusions or blood products.  Those are 
difficulties of principle as well as practice -- an d 
I find them pretty compelling.  I recognise, of 
course, that the political pressures, can become to o 
great but I think the prospects of persuading other
Departments, especially the Treasury, that we had t o 
move now are not at all good. 
"'I am sure that it will be useful to have 
a full discussion of the pros and cons before 
a decision is reached.  And, in the meantime, I am 
sure we must avoid giving any hints to anyone that our 
line could weaken.  That could be fatal.'
"(6) Minute from Mr Malone [himself] to 
Mr Sackville on 1 May 1995: 
"'I know we have discussed this matter 
relatively informally but I thought it would be use ful 
to have my views recorded on paper.  I would firmly
and enthusiastically support a strategy to resist 
compensation payments.  I think a logical and 
defensible distinction could be drawn been HIV 
sufferers and hepatitis C sufferers.
"'However, if we were to resist compensation 
payments, it would be catastrophic to cave into any
subsequent pressure.  There are three points to bea r  
152 in mind: 
"'1.  A national newspaper is bound to take 
a campaigning stance with the usual constituency 
consequences for our Parliamentary colleagues.  
"'2.  A number of supporters of the campaign are 
prominent backbenchers (eg Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smi th, 
a member of the 1922 Executive).  This has a bearin g 
on point 3.  
"'3.  Number 10 must be taken along at all 
stages and alerted both to the likely vigour of the
campaign and to the fact that the PM could be faced
with a powerful deputation at what might be a 
difficult moment (it is quite likely that this woul d 
be around Party Conference time or at the time of 
a possible challenge to his leadership.)
"'Unless these pressures are clearly understood 
now, we risk placing [the Secretary of State] in th e 
invidious position of being obliged to back down 
having initially resisted for all the right reasons . 
That is why we must consider the political 
consequences most carefully before we decide how to
react. 
"(7) I saw this minute and endorsed it with the 
observation:
"'There will always be new examples -- I believe                                   
 
                             53 we must hold the line -- eg growth hormone etc.
Please ensure senior official talk issue through wi th 
Carolyn Fairbairn -- Also that territorials views a re 
established.'"
You go on to say that: 
"My private secretary issued this as a request 
on 5 May 1995.  Carolyn Fairbairn was at the No 10 
Policy Unit." 
(8), on the following page: 
"A meeting was planned on 7 June 1995 to be led 
by Mr Malone to discuss the issue.  On 5 June, 
Mr Pudlo provided an update ahead of the meeting: 
"'VIEWS OF THE TERRITORIALS ..." 
So I won't read through all of this, but in 
Scotland it is said that:
"'The view of officials is that while the 
"no-compensation" position is becoming increasingly
untenable, proposals to link payments to the social
needs and the degree of harm suffered would be 
difficult to establish and the (clinical) judgement s 
required would make it costly and complex to 
administer.'" 

--Result #513--
 An estimate of £30 million is given.  
In Wales:  
154 "'Legal advisers are of the view that it would 
be difficult to sustain the rejection of claims for
compensation on the grounds of a distinction betwee n 
those infected with HIV and HCV.'" 
The estimated cost for Wales was £21 million.  
"'NORTHERN IRELAND -- Officials' view is that it 
is difficult from a point of view of equity to resi st 
comparisons with HIV compensation.  But this could 
mean a substantial drain on health resources.'"
Then there is a comment that Number 10 hadn't 
been fully briefed and that the Prime Minister had 
been asked by John Marshall to receive a deputation  of 
colleagues, and that is a point that was picked up 
with Sir John Major yesterday. 
If we go to the point (9) on this list,
a meeting of 7 June 1995 attended by both Mr Malone
and Mr Sackville, as well as Carolyn Fairbairn, too k 
place although your Private Office was not copied i n 
into the note of the meeting, the conclusion was: 
"'... there was need for ministers to obtain 
a robust view of the Department's ability to defend
any litigation.  More work needed to be done on thi s. 
However, all those present were agreed that it woul d 
be desirable to maintain the status quo and not to 
extend the principle of no-fault compensation eithe r  
155 to those infected with Hepatitis C or CJD.  The 
precedent of payments to those infected with HIV/AI DS 
through blood and blood products was not helpful in
this context but it was agreed that a justifiable 
distinction could be drawn between HIV/AIDS and oth er 
viruses.'"
So we can see that series of meetings and 
minutes.  First of all, in respect of Mr Malone, wa s 
this a case of him being put back into his box?

 You again, as you indicated later, requested and  
159 received international comparators, and this was in
May 1995, it's at paragraph 7.41 of your statement,  in 
subparagraph (3) on page 142. 
And what those comparators -- well, the note 
that was provided with those comparators said that:
"No consensus had emerged concerning the way in 
which those who have been ..." 
If we could go down a little bit, please -- 
actually, sorry, if we can expand out, I've taken i t 
too quickly.  Let's go back to subparagraph (2).  S o 
on 18 May 1995 this is what you wrote: 
"... Mr Scofield sent a submission to my Private 
Secretary in response to an urgent request I had ma de 
for advice on how other major countries had reacted  to 
hepatitis C infection through blood and blood 
products.  I was told that the information was not 
readily available but that Mr Scofield had asked 
Dr Rejman to provide a table showing the position o n 
HIV and Hepatitis C for each country later by the 
close of play the following day.  In the meantime, 
Mr Scofield advised that: 
"No consensus has emerged concerning the way in 
which those who have been damaged non-negligently 
should be treated. 
"So far as we know the UK is the first country  
160 to put in hand a general look back exercise to trac e, 
counsel and where appropriate treat those infected.
"We have no hard details of other countries who 
have set up compensation schemes for those infected
with Hep C. IRU have asked for details." 
Then in paragraph (3): 
"On 19 May 1995 Dr Rejman provided my Private 
Secretary with the table of comparisons stressing t hat 
it was the best information that could currently be
[obtained], but there are bound to be inaccuracies.
Five of the countries tabulated had no payment sche me 
for Hepatitis C; Sweden had a scheme but only for 
payments after 1990 when a test became available;
Austria and the Republic of Ireland had -- or were 
going to have -- a payments scheme." 
Again why did you ask about that and how did it 
inform your thinking?

--Result #515--
 I acted in good faith.  I was diligent, I read the  
164 papers, I spoke to the people, practically never ma de 
a decision without talking to the people involved, and 
I had really difficult things to do. 
I just put this on one side.  We'd had report 
after report about the future of London hospitals, 
29 reports, but nobody had never made any decisions .
And I had to make the decisions about, you know, wh ich 
hospitals to merge, close, amalgamate, because we 
needed fewer, better hospitals.  And nobody ever wa nts 
to make the unpopular decisions.  It's easy to make
the popular decisions, but if you're in Government you 
do have -- particularly running the Health Service -- 
to make very difficult decisions. 
So this, to me, is exactly how it was.  I wanted 
to do more.  We were going really fast.  I mean, we
were going further than we'd been advised.
Treasury, although I'm very generous about them 
in the statement, I have explained previously I had
a different view about them as well when I was 
fighting them. 
And every decision had an opportunity cost.  So 
if we'd put more into compensation payments, then 
there is less for mental health, less for, you know , 
child -- for paediatric health, less for dementia.  So 
it's -- it's a limited pool.  And this was a preced ent                                   
 
                             65 which if once -- once we'd broken this precedent it
would open up -- had the potential to open up all 
across the waterfront and, to me, have a really 
damaging effect on the NHS, quite apart from the 
Licensing Authority, the CSM and all of the other 
points that we've made.  So I did my best at the ti me.

--Result #516--
 Let's move on to the question of no-fault compensat ion 
and ex gratia payments more generally. 
A question which has been raised not just with 
you but in respect of other witnesses as well, is

work and gave serious thought to the possibility of
a no-fault compensation scheme.

 I don't.  I think there was really serious respect and 
concern.  I think the quality of the interchange, f or 
example, with the Macfarlane Trust and 
The Haemophilia Society was of a very high quality and 
at a very senior level.  Some patient groups would 
have had liaison with the Department at a much more
junior level.  But the point was, we were worried 
about IUDs, we were worried about benzodiazepene, w e 
were worried about CJD, we were worried about medic al 
accidents where there had been no negligence. 
The feeling was that once this was a situation 
which could get entirely out of control, the mounti ng 
bill for litigation in the Health Service was alrea dy 
worrying us, we were talking about what was happeni ng 
in America.  I think the exceptional -- the 
exceptional step was to agree to, first of all, the 
187 Macfarlane Trust, then the 20 million, then the 
42 million, and I'm absolutely delighted we did.  B ut 
I don't think -- compared with any other user group  -- 
and, remember, I was seeing people with HIV and AID S 
all of the time. 
So if you'd been a young woman who had had 
a relationship with a man who was HIV positive and you 
became HIV positive, your baby became HIV positive,
all those AIDS sufferers, there was absolutely no 
compensation for them whatsoever.  And I understand , 
rightly so.  But, remember, I was talking to differ ent 
patient groups who had no compensation, no ex grati a 
payment.

--Result #518--
 Given the limits on Government funding, did the 
Government, to your knowledge, explore the possibil ity 
of seeking a contribution from the pharmaceutical 
companies in order to provide more generous 
compensation or payments?

--Result #519--
 The view from Wales was recorded as being this, and
I quote: 
"Legal advisers are of the view that it would be 
difficult to sustain rejection of claims for 
compensation on the grounds of a distinction betwee n 
those infected with HIV and HCV.  Such grounds are  
194 considered insufficiently robust to resist judicial
review." 

--Result #520--
 I think all the background that Mr Sackville had be en 
labouring over for many months, and all of the --  
196 I mean all of the letters that we'd been signing an d 
the debates.  There is a very good debate with 
Baroness Cumberlege in the Lords actually on hep C 
compensation, and Lord Annan supports her and says we 
don't want to become like America where we start 
providing compensation for, you know, a whole -- 
a growing number of conditions. 

--Result #521--
 Would you just excuse me for a second, a couple of 
late questions have been passed up to me. 
The question is posed: did you ever consider the 
position that the Irish government took over 
a no-fault compensation scheme to compensate people
with haemophilia who were infected, in an identical
way to people in the UK using US contaminated 
products; and, if so, why did you not recommend 
replicating that scheme, which recognised extreme p ain 
and suffering of people who were infected with seve ral 
viruses?                                  
 
                             13 
--Result #522--
 So I'm going to now pick up the chronology of your 
involvement with the question of whether there shou ld 
be some form of financial support or compensation f or 
those infected with hepatitis C?

--Result #523--
 So that's just to set the background. 
Then if we look at a couple of documents that 
pre-date your arrival by a few days.  The first is 
DHSC0042937_057, please.  So this is a briefing for
the Prime Minister, 21 November 1995, so just over 
a week before you take up your post, and it's reall y 
just to get a sense of what the pre-existing policy  or 
line was at that point in time.  If we have the 
heading "Compensation?", please, Lawrence, in the 
paragraphs below that.  We can see there what's sai d  
14 is: 
"What the hon member is asking for is 
compensation for patients where, tragic though thei r 
circumstances are, no fault and no negligence on th e 
part of the NHS has been proved.  
"The House will understand the significance and 
implications of such a move.  The principle involve d 
is not one which can or should be lightly breached.
"My [right honourable friend Secretary of State]
for Health has reiterated the policy of his 
predecessors, most recently in evidence to the Heal th 
Select Committee (July 1995), but he does not belie ve 
'no-fault compensation' is a sensible use of NHS 
resources." 
So that is the policy of the Department of 
Health, the policy of the Government, at the time t hat 
you took up your post?

--Result #524--
 Then if we go to the bottom half of the page, we ca n 
see the subject is "Hep C -- Haemophilia Society 
Campaign for Compensation":
"This is to alert you to the publication on 
Monday, 4 December of a report by The Haemophilia 
Society on the impact on its members who have been 
infected with Hepatitis C (through blood products).
You will be aware that the Society are campaigning for 
compensation for such members similar to that provi ded 
for people infected with HIV through blood/blood 
products. 
"The report, based on a survey carried out by 
the Society looks at health, welfare and financial 
implication (eg loss of work) resulting from the 
infections.  It will no doubt be used as evidence t o 
support the contention that members are suffering 
hardship through no fault of their own and should b e 
compensated.  John Marshall MP has a reachable oral  on 
Tuesday and he will be armed with a copy.  It is  
16 likely that the press will run stories the same day .
I am trying to get hold of an advance copy.  The li ne 
to take should remain ..." 
Then this is what's set out as the line to take: 
"'The Government has great sympathy for those 
infected with Hepatitis C as a result of NHS 
treatment.  But as no fault nor negligence on the p art 
of the NHS has been proved there are no plans to ma ke 
special payments.'"
Then if we then pick it up with your own 
involvement, the next day, DHSC0042937_071, this is
again from Mr Pudlo to your Private Office, 
1 December 1995, it refers in the heading to 
John Marshall and the anticipated oral question.  I t 
says: 
"At yesterday's briefing meeting for the above 
oral PS(H) ..." 
That's you, I think, Lord Horam?

--Result #525--
 "... what followed was prevarication and an  
30 unwillingness to make any real contribution to ease
the plight of those infected. 
"To be fair and to balance the picture, the 
Government were sympathetic and supportive of 
haemophiliacs who received contaminated blood and 
became infected with HIV.  It is beyond argument th at 
that disease is more severe than hepatitis C, but t he 
similarities between them are too great to be ignor ed. 
"The circumstances under which individuals 
became infected with a second disease are exactly t he 
same in each case.  The test to prevent HIV being 
passed on stopped the hepatitis C virus being passe d 
on.  Both illnesses can be -- and are -- debilitati ng. 
All those who suffer face the worry of passing the 
disease to a loved one or to an unborn child.  All 
face difficulties in education and employment.  All
face the impossibility of gaining life insurance, 
unless it is offered at a totally prohibitive cost. "
Then Mr Mudie sets out, and we see a reference 
to this family in a number of different parliamenta ry 
reports, I won't read it out, but three brothers, t wo 
infected with HIV, who received some financial 
assistance, a third, infected with hepatitis C -- 
contracted hepatitis C, died, received nothing. 
Top of the next page, please.  So right-hand  
31 column, if we pick it up in the second paragraph: 
"When we debated the subject before, the then 
Minister talked in global sums and mentioned a figu re 
of £6 billion, representing the cost of a total 
no-fault compensation scheme.  That is not what we are 
asking for.  We ask simply that a relatively discre te 
small group of people should receive some assistanc e 
as a mark of the finance hardship and of the physic al 
and emotional pain that they're suffering. 
"Of course someone in the Treasury, or even in 
the Department of Health will say that that would 
create a precedent.  However, the argument about 
precedent is the argument of administrative 
convenience; it is not the argument of compassion o r 
of Christmas -- you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, have 
just come from the Christmas carol service.  The 
precedent was created when the Macfarlane Trust was
set up; the Government rightly decided to make 
ex gratia payments to haemophiliacs infected with H IV,
and then to non-haemophiliacs infected with that 
virus.  The Prime Minister took a major part in bot h 
those decisions, so I hope the report of our debate
will be sent to him so that he can act upon it." 
Then just a little further down the page-- no, 
sorry, the previous page still.  Sorry, I've got ha rd  
32 copies, two copies of the same page.  No, that's fi ne. 
So we then get a response from you -- 

--Result #526--
 And you said this in response: 
"Yes.  That is a valuable point, which my 
hon Friend makes for the first time, The 
Haemophilia Society -- understandably, as it has no t 
completed its study -- has not made full and costed
proposals.  We have never received such a suggestio n 
to study, and I would be interested to hear details  of 
the relatively modest and restricted proposal which  my 
hon Friend has made during the debate." 
Then you set out a number of other matters, 
including some issues that had been raised about 
treatment with alpha interferon.
If we go to the next page, please, and we 
look -- so it's the left-hand column, the last 
paragraph, you said this at the end of your speech:
"All that I have heard in today's debate 
suggests that I should read the Haemophilia Society 's 
report extremely closely, and I promise the House t hat 
I shall look at the matter afresh in the light of w hat 
I said in the report.  We have also heard from my 
hon Friend a sensible suggestion for a more modest and 
restricted compensation scheme than has been hither to 
mentioned.  For those reasons, I shall leave the  
38 matter at this stage, although I give my full sympa thy 
to those who have the disease." 
So, Lord Horam, is it right to understand that 
you were promising or indicating that you would loo k 
at two matters.  First, you'd look at the whole mat ter 
afresh in light of The Haemophilia Society's report , 
and, secondly, you wanted to think about the more - - 
the narrower proposal that Mr Marshall had put 
forward?

--Result #527--
 We can look and see what the response was, I think,
perhaps, to what you said, and pick it up in that w ay. 
So then we have your speech on 13 December 1995, 
your words to Parliament. 
If we just, again taking things in a strictly 
chronological order, go to DHSC0004060_002. 
Now, this is a letter sent from you the 
following day, 14 December 1995, to an MP who had 
written on behalf of a constituent. 
And if we can see, I think probably just in 
the -- it's the second through to the fourth 
paragraph, you say in this letter: 
"My predecessor explained the Government's 
position on those infected with hepatitis C in the 
Adjournment Debate on 11 July ... We have great 
sympathy with those patients who may have become 
infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusion s 
or blood products.  However, in the absence of 
negligence we have no plans to make special payment s." 
The next paragraph then, again, talks about 
patients receiving the best treatment available in 
light of medical knowledge at the time. 
Then the next one says: 
"The Government has never accepted the case for  
40 a no fault scheme of compensation for medical 
accidents.  It is unfair to others and still requir es 
proof of causation which is often difficult to 
establish.  Every individual case where a medical 
accident has occurred is a personal tragedy for bot h 
the individual concerned and their family.  If the NHS 
is proved negligent in a Court, it accepts its 
liability to pay damages." 
And so on, and so the letter continues.
What you say about this in your statement, 
Lord Horam, and perhaps you want -- if you would wa nt 
to turn that up, WITN5294001, and we can go to 
page 19, I think.  Yes, paragraph 2.20, page 19. 
What you say is this, and you refer to the 
letter, and then you say in the third line: 
"As the Inquiry will be aware, responses such as 
this would be drafted by officials at first instanc e 
and the draft sent to me for approval.  This letter
would undoubtedly have reflected the Department's 
established position at the time against a Hepatiti s C 
payments scheme.  For example, the reply stated tha t 
we had no plans to make special payments and argued
that the most effective use of resources was to see k 
to improve the understanding, management and treatm ent 
of the condition.  As I address below, I wanted to                                   
 
                             1 soften this standard line in correspondence." 
We'll come on to the softening of the standard 
line. 
But, essentially, although this letter was sent 
out the day after you'd said in Parliament you woul d 
look at matters afresh, it had been drafted, no dou bt, 
before then -- 

--Result #528--
 You say this: 
"You [and that, I think, may be Ms Weatherseed 
but, in any event, it doesn't matter] rang to advis e 
that PS(H) [that's you, Lord Horam] would like the 
words 'at present' inserted in the statement that ' we 
have no plans to make special payments' in our repl ies  
44 to correspondence on compensation for haemophiliacs
infected with hepatitis C." 
Then there is, I think, a reference to 
a particular letter where it's suggested that you'd
already made such an amendment.
Then paragraph 2 says: 
"In answering recent parliamentary questions and 
in adjournment debates PS(H) has said that he wishe s 
to study the Haemophilia Society's interim report o f 
its impact study carefully before coming to any 
conclusions about its implications.  He has also 
indicated a willingness to study any new proposals 
(eg for schemes limited to those who develop chroni c 
illness).  However we fear that if we were to quali fy 
the existing line in correspondence as suggested, i t 
would be taken as indicating a weakening of the 
Government's position and imply that compensation i s 
being considered, and further continued pressure wo uld 
lead to concessions. 
"In view of the above, PS(H) may wish to discuss 
the proposed additional wording with SoS."  
That's the Secretary of State. 
Now, it might be thought that last sentence has 
an air of you being sent off to the headmaster's 
study.  Is that a fair way of reading it, do you                                   
 
                             5 think?

--Result #529--
 If the Secretary of State is the headmaster, I'm no t 
quite sure what that makes the Permanent Secretary 
but, in any event, it might be said there is an air  of  
46 you being reported to the Permanent Secretary here.
So the date is still 20 December 1995, there is 
a reference towards the bottom of what we see on th e 
screen: 
"Thank you for copying your minute to me.  I 
have copied it on to the Permanent Secretary (and 
Miss Edwards) -- see the attached note." 
Then if we go down to the bottom of the page, 
and this is not, I think, something that you saw at
the time -- again your statement sets that out -- b ut 
it says this: 
"The Permanent Secretary may be wish to be aware 
of the attached minute.  I mentioned to him the oth er 
day that PS(H) was clearly not happy with the firm 
line Ministers have taken up to now on compensation
for haemophiliacs infected with hepatitis C.  It is
quite clear that he is trying to change the line,
little by little.  He has had plenty of briefing 
(written and oral) on the subject, but his sympathy
for those concerned is clearly uppermost in his min d. 
Cost comes second -- hence his readiness to conside r 
proposals for a scheme limited to those who have 
actually developed chronic illness, rather than 
extending to all who had been infected.  Secretary of 
State met a group of haemophiliacs (led by  
47 Roy Hattersley) yesterday, and made no concessions. " 
So if we just go back to the bottom of that 
previous page, and we just look at the text, those 
last 10 lines or so.  Thank you, Lawrence.
Now, I think in your statement you suggest you 
weren't necessarily trying to change the line, you 
wanted to explore the position, however, with an op en 
mind; is that a fair summary?

--Result #530--
 I don't think it's a question of cost coming first,
it's just that there was clearly a big cost, and th e 
Department had always taken the line that when it c ame 
to allocating money, treatment and healthcare was t he 
first consideration and compensation the second 
consideration.

--Result #531--
 Now, if we then -- I don't think we need to put it up 
on screen but I'll just read a reference into the 
transcript, it's HSOC0014333.  On 21 December you 
wrote to the Reverend Tanner, explaining that you 
wanted to consider the report and you suggested 
a possible meeting in the New Year.  You deal with 
that in your witness statement, paragraph 2.26, and
explain that was essentially a holding reply.  So 
I don't think we need to take time looking at that.
But if we go to now early 1996, DHSC0003883_123. 
This is from your Private Office to Mr Guinness wit hin 
the Department of Health, and you say this -- or sh e 
says this on your behalf, in the first paragraph: 
"... PS(H) has been giving further thought to 
the issue of awarding compensation to haemophiliacs
who contracted hepatitis C before routine screening  of 
blood products was introduced.  He is well aware of
our current position on this  issue and the reasons for 
this.  However, against a background of mounting 
political pressure, he would like to explore the 
options for offering compensation, if only to assur e 
himself that we have done all that is feasible."  
51 The reference there to "mounting political 
pressure", is that essentially a reference to the 
views that were being expressed, I think by MPs -- not 
just in opposition but a number of different MPs --  on 
this issue?

--Result #532--
 Then Ms Weatherseed says: 
"I would be grateful if you could prepare 
a submission for PS(H) setting out costed options f or 
compensation (which could vary, for example, accord ing 
to factors such as age, the existence of dependants , 
hardship factors, limited to those who have actuall y 
developed Hep C).  This should include an assessmen t 
of how far any of these options are likely to be 
acceptable to the Haemophilia Society. 
"This should also provide advice on the likely 
availability of funds and the implications any chan ge 
in policy might have in terms of triggering off 
demands from other areas, both from people (whether
haemophiliacs or not) who were infected by blood, 
rather than blood products, and more generally (for 
52 example, if blood or blood products are shown in 
future to have transmitted as yet unrecognised 
infectious agent)." 
So you essentially asked officials to go away 
and work up a set of options for you to consider?

--Result #533--
 I think the wording that was ultimately alighted up on 
we can see from DHSC0004498_025.  
58 So this is a sample letter, this one is to an MP 
dated 8 January 1996, and you say in the third 
paragraph that you want to take time to read 
The Haemophilia Society's report in detail.  You se t 
out your belief that it graphically describes the 
problems experienced by some sufferers and how that
will supplement what you'd heard about the plight o f 
those infected during debates, from correspondence and 
at meetings. 
You then, in the last paragraph, refer to, 
again, the standard line to take, "best treatment 
available in light of medical knowledge", and so on . 
Then over the page, you say this: 
"We are always ready to listen to further 
evidence but I have to say that on the basis of the se 
facts we have no plans to make payment to such 
patients.  This position is consistent with 
Government's overall policy of not accepting the ca se 
for a no fault scheme of compensation for medical 
accidents." 
So that, I think, was the slightly amended line, 
a readiness to listen, but on the basis of current 
facts, no plans; is that right? 

--Result #534--
 Bottom of the page, there is a heading "Number of 
Haemophiliacs Infected with HCV", and there is 
a record of there being general agreement that abou t  
64 1,300 haemophiliacs were infected.
Then if we go over the page, we see the first of 
three options set out.  So the first is a scheme ba sed 
on the lump sum elements of the HIV scheme, and 
paragraph 8 records what those payments were, and 
paragraph 9, towards the bottom of the page, sets o ut 
what the average payment under the HIV scheme had 
been, £60,000. 
So this option, as I understand it, Lord Horam, 
is costed on the basis of assuming a similar figure , 
and then you get the costs set out there, it would be 
180 million if paid to all infected; 90 million if 
limited to those with chronic hepatitis; 36 million  on 
the John Marshall model, limited to those with 
cirrhosis.  That's a simple calculation based upon 
multiplying 60,000 by reference to the numbers that
might fall within each of those cohorts.
If we go over the page, paragraph 10 explains 
what the figures exclude.  So they exclude any 
extension to infected spouses or children or 
administration costs. 
Paragraph 11 deals with the question of payments 
to the estates of those who had died.
Paragraph 12 says different stages of the 
disease are difficult to define precisely.                                  
 
                             5 Paragraph 13 explains there could be variants on 
this option.  For example, paid 20,000 on evidence of 
infection, with higher sums if chronic disease was 
confirmed. 
Paragraph 14 explains the costs would be heavily 
front loaded if based on infection, but spread over
a period of many years if based on chronic disease.
Then paragraph 15:
"A scheme of this kind would be:- 
"- simple, but expensive and untargeted if based 
on infection alone.
"- less simple (some would say impossible to 
operate), but somewhat better targeted, if it took 
account of the various stages of the disease." 
So that's the first option you were presented 
with in any event, a scheme based on lump sum eleme nts 
of the HIV scheme.
If we go over to the next page, we can see the 
second option was a scheme based on the discretiona ry 
elements of the HIV scheme, and paragraph 16 explai ns 
that the Macfarlane and Eileen Trusts made payments  to 
those suffering particular hardship.  Some details of 
those payments are then set out.  I don't propose t o 
read through that.
If we go to the bottom of the page, paragraph 19  
66 says: 
"Equity would suggest that payments to people 
infected with HCV should be on the same basis as 
payments to people infected with HIV.  Payments at 
these levels [those of the modest sum set out above ,
the modest monthly sums] would be most unlikely to be 
acceptable on their own, (many would get £70 a mont h)
and would therefore be additional to any lump sum 
scheme." 
Then the next page, please, paragraph 20 
discusses some of the difficulties in costing this 
idea, because detailed knowledge of age, profile an d 
financial circumstances of potential recipients wou ld 
be needed.
"A rule of thumb would suggest that a scheme for 
haemophiliacs infected with HCV would cost around 
£6 million a year, but the true figure is likely to  be 
a bit higher ..."
A suggestion is made of £7 million per year. 
There is then a discussion about how total costs 
would depend on how long people lived: 
"People infected with hepatitis C are likely to 
survive on average considerably longer than those w ith 
HIV.  An average of 20 years might be assumed, givi ng 
a cost ... of around £140 million."  
67 Then it's explained that some of these costs 
will be met from the interest earned by the Trust, so 
it would not all fall to the public purse. 
"An alternative approach might be to involve the 
insurance industry ..."
Then paragraph 21: 
"A scheme of this kind would enable needs to be 
targeted more precisely, but would have the 
disadvantages associated with means testing, as wel l 
as being expensive to administer.  It would have to
stay in place for many years, unless off-loaded to the 
insurance industry." 
So that's your second option. 
Then the third option, "A Scheme Based on the 
Irish scheme", and this refers to a recent 
announcement by Irish ministers of extending an 
existing scheme covering those who had contracted H CV 
from Anti D to other individuals who had become 
infected. 
Then some details are there set out how it's, 
administered by a tribunal, the approach of the 
tribunal.  Paragraph 23 explains that: 
"So far there have been no awards as the 
Tribunal has yet to be established. 
Paragraph 24 in the absence of hard information  
68 it's very difficult to assess what sort of payments
might arise under such a scheme." 
So those are the three options that were set out 
in the paper for you. 
If we go over the page, there is a section on 
the possible reaction of the Haemophilia Society.  I'm 
not going to read that aloud.  But if we go towards
the bottom of the page, there is then 
a section "People Infected through Blood Transfusio n". 
And the paper said: 
"PS(H) will have noted that neither the existing 
HIV scheme in this country, nor the HCV scheme in t he 
Irish Republic is confined to haemophiliacs.  In th e 
view of officials, it would be impossible to confin e 
any scheme to haemophiliacs -- the pressure to exte nd 
it to people infected through blood transfusion wou ld 
be irresistible.  If anything their case is stronge r 
because some were infected after test were known to
exist. 
"30.  An exercise is currently under way to 
trace people who were infected with HCV through blo od 
transfusion and who are still alive." 
That's the look-back:
"This is expected to identify about 3000 people.
At the very least, therefore, we should allow doubl e                                   
 
                             9 the costs quoted above ..."
Then the range of figures, depending upon which 
of the options is under consideration, are then set
out. 
Paragraph 31 sets out what might be some 
difficulties in administering a scheme for people 
infected through blood transfusion, essentially 
because of the need to establish the causal link.
We've then got a heading "Unquantifiable Future 
Claims", and this then gets to some of the policy 
concerns of the department. 
Paragraph 32:
"The opening of the door to future claims for 
no-fault compensation has previously been a matter of 
great concern to Ministers.  There are a number of 
aspects to this." 
And the first point that's made is that 
hepatitis C can be transmitted not only through blo od 
and blood products but through any transplanted 
tissue. 
The second then is the possibility of other 
viruses and infectious agents being transmitted by 
blood or tissue.  And reference is made to 
hepatitis G, a new strain of hepatitis virus just 
having been identified. 
70 Then if we go over the page, paragraph 35, it 
says: 
"Third, potentially, the whole question of 
compensation for medical accidents is opened up. 
Haemophiliacs received the best possible 
treatment ..." 
Again, I'll pick up on that in a little while: 
"... treatment which prolonged their life.  If 
they are to be compensated, who else should be?"
And then there are suggestions of other cohorts 
of patients and it's said no treatment is entirely 
free of risk. 
Paragraph 36 then refers to litigation against 
the Department and the Medical Research Council in 
respect of patients treated with human growth hormo ne. 
Then "Finance", paragraph 37: 
"The Treasury will not make additional available 
money to the Department.  Any costs will therefore 
have to come from the resources already available f or 
patient care. 
"38.  The question of who should pay for people 
infected in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland wi ll 
need further consideration.  This Department bore a nd 
continues to bear the full cost of the original HIV
scheme (apart from the initial 20,000 ex gratia  
71 payments which were paid for by the Treasury)." 
Just in relation to paragraph 37, Lord Horam, we 
obviously saw the Treasury's opposition expressed i n 
that letter from Mr Grice to Mr Dobson that we look ed 
at this morning, but were you aware of any formal 
approach being made to the Treasury, setting out wh at 
might be the arguments for providing some form of 
financial support scheme to hepatitis C?

--Result #535--
 We then get the heading "Policy on 
No-Fault Compensation Schemes".
Paragraph 39 restates the broad opposition to 
no-fault compensation.  And then paragraph 40 sets out 
what is said to be the arguments against 
no-fault compensation.  The first is why should 
compensation for victims of medical accidents diffe r 
from systems for people harmed in another way.  The
other talks about the feelings of victims of 
negligence.
Then over the page, paragraph 41 sets out some 
other reasons for opposing no-fault compensation:
difficulties of proof of causation, unfairness, cos t,  
72 accountability, amounts payable.
Then the summary, in paragraph 42: 
"In short, any compensation for HCV positive 
haemophiliacs would be a departure from the policy 
previously stated by the Secretary of State that 
payments should not be made when treatment given ha s 
been in accordance with the best knowledge and 
practice of the day." 
So, again, the assertion is repeated about best 
treatment, treatment in accordance with best knowle dge 
and practice of the day. 
There is then a reference to the submissions 
from the previous year. 
Then over the page we can see the conclusion, 
paragraph 45, which I think in fairness I should re ad: 
"- A scheme, which would be contrary to general 
Government policy on no-fault compensation, could n ot 
be confined to haemophiliacs. 
"- The options considered here for compensation 
for infections with hepatitis C would cost in the 
order of £72 million to £360 million, with regular 
payments costing perhaps an additional 
£280 million over the years (though not all this 
latter cost would come from the public purse).
"- Early indications are that only the most                                   
 
                             3 expensive scheme would be acceptable to the 
Haemophilia Society, but we shall know more when ou r 
own proposals are received. 
"- A scheme based on infection alone would be 
heavily front loaded. 
"- There would be incalculable repercussions for 
the future.  The newly discovered hepatitis G virus
alone could multiply the cost of compensating peopl e 
infected through blood transfusion by 10 (giving 
a range of £400 million to £2,000 million for the l ump 
sum options). 
"- The costs of this and future schemes would 
reduce the amount of money available for patient 
care." 
Now, I think what you say in your witness 
statement about this -- and it's WITN5294001, page 25, 
paragraph 2.34 -- you've set out the conclusion tha t 
I've just read, and then you observe, underneath th at: 
"It is fair to say, therefore, that officials 
were giving me strong warnings about the costs and 
implications of introducing a Hepatitis payment 
scheme." 
Now, I'll come back to some of the concerns that 
underpinned the conclusions in the paper, Lord Hora m, 
once we've finished going through the contemporaneo us  
74 documents.  But that's the submission you received in 
February 1996. 
Now, I don't know whether you can help us with 
this, Lord Horam.  The sums there discussed are 
obviously not small, but, in the great scheme of 
Government spending, they're also not vast.  Do you
have any recollection of, leaving aside what the 
source of the funding might be, what your reaction was 
or your thinking was when you saw the different 
costings?

--Result #536--
 Now, again, just taking things chronologically, 
The Haemophilia Society's final report was sent to 
ministers, I think, on 20 February 1996, or                                   
 
                             7 thereabouts.  The reference is HSOC0002726_001. 
Now I'm not going to go through this report,
because if we go to the next page and just look at the 
contents, this further report essentially doesn't 
repeat what was set out in the interim report; the 
interim report had been focused on the financial 
compensation or financial assistance recommendation
and the reasons for it. 
This final report looked at, largely, a range of 
other issues, important issues, but didn't say 
anything new on the issue of financial support.

--Result #537--
 Then we can see the next day, DHSC0003883_100, ther e 
is a minute from the Permanent Secretary or on beha lf 
of the Permanent Secretary, to your office. 
So if we look at the text:
"The Permanent Secretary has seen your minute of 
28 February to Mr Guinness and will be interested t o 
see his reply. 
"2.  He appreciates that it may be possible to 
devise schemes which cover only restricted groups a nd 
are thus more affordable.  He does however point ou t 
that any move to pay compensation to a restricted 
group of Hepatitis C sufferers (eg haemophiliacs) i s 
likely to lead to irresistible pressure to extend i t                                   
 
                             1 to a much wider group.  There is no obvious basis o r 
distinguishing between people infected via blood 
products and those infected by blood transfusion, f or 
example; and the Government was quite unable to 
sustain the same distinction in the case of HIV/AID S 
sufferers.  The unfortunate truth is that this is 
a very slippery slope.  Our present stance is 
uncomfortable, but any movement, however slight, is
likely to start something we won't be able to stop.
"3.  He, therefore recommends extreme caution in 
dealing with Mr Marshall's proposal." 
So a warning shot across the bows from the 
Permanent Secretary to you?

--Result #538--
 Then the other part of the briefing which is releva nt 
to this issue is at DHSC0002533_007.  So this is 
headed "Policy and Compensation", and then we have the 
heading, "Line to take", so again it's the 
pre-existing policy line: 
"[They] received the best treatment available in                                   
 
                             9 the light of medical knowledge at the time.  No fau lt 
or negligence on the part of the NHS has been prove d,
and we have no plans to make special payments." 
That's paragraph 1.2.  Then paragraph 1.4: 
"However, if the Society has specific proposals 
to put forward, as said in the House we would be 
prepared to look at these." 
Then we have the background, I don't think 
I need to read all of that, but if we just look at 
paragraph 1.6, picking it up in the third line, it 
says: 
"They [and that's a reference to the Society]
accept that no negligence was involved in infecting
their members but are likely to argue that there is  no 
real difference between the HIV cases who received 
compensation and the HCV cases who did not and that
natural justice demands equal treatment." 
Then, in square brackets there is this: 
"[Secretary of State], in evidence to the Health 
Committee, whilst rejecting the argument for 
compensation accepted that the HIV position was 
illogical -- the Society have so far not used this. " 
I'm going to come on to that, Lord Horam, but 
I will just flag it up as it's set out there.

--Result #539--
 Now, it would appear that at some point over the 
following weeks you essentially came to the view th at 
there wouldn't be a scheme, and I'm going to pick t hat 
up, if I may, by looking at WITN5294010.  
92 So this is now 29 May 1996, and it's Mr Pudlo to 
Mrs Weatherseed, paragraph 1: 
"Since PS(H)'s meeting with the Haemophilia 
Society on 26 March, the Society have been expectin g 
a response to their proposals for a compensation 
scheme ..."
Then paragraph 2: 
"We agreed that I should submit a draft letter 
for PS(H) to consider once the PM had reaffirmed th e 
Government's opposition to a settlement in his lett er 
to John Marshall ... and this is now attached." 
We've explored the Prime Minister's involvement 
in his evidence on Monday, Lord Horam.  The draft 
letter -- it's not the final letter that was sent, but 
the draft letter is at WITN5294011, and the draft 
says, in the third paragraph: 
"As I have made clear in the House on a number 
of occasions I am very touched by the plight of tho se 
people and the circumstances in which they became 
infected.  However, having weighed all the factors 
involved I have concluded that in allocating money 
provided for health care I cannot justify taking 
resources away from treating patients in order to 
provide payments to people who received the best 
possible treatment available at the time."                                   
 
                             3 Now, the letter that was finally sent was sent 
at the beginning of October, rather than at the end  of 
May -- 

--Result #540--
 There came a point in time when there was not going  to 
be a compensation scheme as such.  I don't think 
I ever ruled out something more modest.  I was stil l 
struggling to get something on that.

--Result #541--
 In the second paragraph, he says he'd like to 
"re-emphasise the seriousness of the problem".  He 
talks about the numbers who were dying, he refers t o 
the research report and the financial, social and 
economic problems that those infected and their 
families faced.  
Then in the third paragraph he says that: 
"... we believe that the Government should take 
immediate action to help address this tragic 
situation.  We therefore call on the Government to set 
up a £20 [million] Trust Fund to meet the financial
needs of those who are suffering and their dependan ts.
In addition, we shall press for a £10,000 ex gratia
payment ..."
So that's the Reverend Tanner to you in 
June 1996.  What I think, as I understand the 
documents, then happens is -- it can be picked up f rom 
DHSC0041255_070.  So it's 9 July, it's from 
Mrs Weatherseed to Paul Pudlo, paragraph 1 refers t o 
there having been a meeting the previous day: 
"... we discussed the need to reply to The 
Haemophilia Society's latest request for a scheme t o 
compensate haemophiliacs ...  
99 "PS(H) has now decided that he would like to 
write to the Haemophilia Society on ... 19 July. 
Could you provide a suitable draft letter which: 
"stresses that we have considered their demands 
very carefully;
"explains our decision not to provide 
compensation; 
"reiterates our view that funds would be best 
spent on providing better care etc; 
"states that we shall look favourably on any 
future application for [section] 64 funding ... 
"PS(H) has also asked that the letter should 
discuss the alternative options for funding suggest ed 
by John Marshall MP (National Lottery, Government 
contingency funds and settlements from drug 
companies).  I am not sure whether these points hav e 
ever been raised by the Haemophilia Society itself. " 
Now, it would appear clear from paragraph 2, 
Lord Horam, is this right, that in terms of a more 
extensive compensation or financial support scheme,
the decision was not -- by this time the decision w as 
not to go with that, was not to do what The 
Haemophilia Society was asking?

--Result #542--
 Then we can see, paragraph 2, there is caution abou t 
responding to The Haemophilia Society: 
"... I do wonder about the wisdom of writing to 
the Haemophilia Society until media interest in the
CJD case has died down.  Although the fact that we 
have been found negligent in one case does not mean
that we should suddenly change our policy and decid e 
to pay compensation when no negligence has been 
demonstrated (nor, indeed, alleged by the 
Haemophilia Society itself, as distinct from 
a number of potential individual litigants who are 
currently seeking Counsel's opinion), a clear 
statement to the Haemophilia Society at this stage 
that we are not prepared to pay financial compensat ion 
might be presented as the Government having forced one 
set of unfortunate people to endure the uncertainti es 
of legal action now doing the same again." 
So you were essentially advised to hold off -- 

--Result #543--
   Lord Horam, we're going to look now at your 
letter of 1 October 1996 to the Reverend Tanner. 
Lawrence, could we have HSOC0023572, please. 
So the letter is dated 1 October 1996, and if we 
pick it up in the second paragraph: 
"I am sorry that it's taken so long for me to 
respond formally, but I am sure you will appreciate
that I needed to consider very carefully your 
proposals and their implications before deciding 
whether it would be right to alter our position on the 
question of compensation. 
"After much thought, I have concluded that it 
would not be appropriate to offer financial 
compensation to haemophiliacs who have been infecte d 
with Hepatitis C.  I will explain my reasons for th is, 
but I should first stress that I shall continue to 
listen to the arguments and look at other ways in 
which we can provide help. 
"I hope that I have already made very clear my 
deep sympathy all those affected by this inadverten t 
tragedy.  I have been very touched by the real  
111 problems that they clearly face and I am committed to 
doing what I can to help.  In considering whether 
compensation is the right way to do this, two point s 
have been apparent.
"Firstly, we do not accept there has been 
negligence on the part of the NHS.  Tragic though i t 
is that the very treatment designed to help those 
patients infected should have caused them harm, the re 
can be no question that they received the best 
treatment available at the time.  That treatment wa s 
essential for their survival.  As you know, we take
a view that compensation is only appropriate where 
there has been negligence. 
"If we were to provide compensation on the basis 
of non-negligent harm, this would very quickly deve lop 
into a general no-fault compensation scheme, which 
would be both unworkable and unfair.  This is a poi nt 
that was considered in relation to the settlement f or 
HIV cases.  On that occasion we were convinced by t he 
very special nature of the disease and by arguments
that it would not lead to further similar claims fo r 
compensation." 
Over the page: 
"Second, all the proposals for compensation (and 
you will be aware that I have considered a wide ran ge  
112 of options) involve the expenditure of substantial 
sums of public money.  I have a duty to consider th e 
effect of such a sizeable sum on other health servi ce 
expenditure.  That duty has led me to conclude that
funds that are available to the NHS, from whatever 
source, are best used in a direct patient care. 
"You will also be aware that suggestions have 
been made for funding compensation from sources oth er 
than the NHS budget and I have given these careful 
consideration.  Although theoretically possible, 
funding through the commercial sector or the Nation al 
Lottery are not matters in which it would be 
appropriate for me to seek to exert influence.  The
first would be a matter for any companies involved and 
the second for the independent National Lotteries 
Board." 
Then you go on to deal with a range of other 
matters which have been raised by The Haemophilia 
Society, including research into hepatitis C, issue s 
about availability of treatment, such as 
Alpha Interferon, and so on, and I'm not proposing to 
read those out. 
If we can go back to the first page then, 
Lord Horam, and just unpick some of the reasoning t hat 
was put forward.                                   
 
                             13 The fourth paragraph, where you talk about your 
deep sympathy for all those affected, you used the 
phrase "by this inadvertent tragedy".  Now, 
"inadvertent" might be said to suggest that this wa s 
unavoidable, it was bad luck, that it was nobody's 
fault.  Do you recall reflecting on the use of the 
word "inadvertent" or what you meant by saying it w as 
an "inadvertent tragedy"?

--Result #544--
 Now, obviously, if we go back to the previous page,
bottom paragraph, what is set out there is the conc ern 
about the slippery slope, that's not phrase you use
there, but the risk that there would become a gener al 
no-fault compensation scheme. 
Why was that such a concern, in the sense, why 
was the Department so convinced, it would appear in
what they were saying to you at least, that this mi ght 
lead to a general no-fault compensation scheme?

--Result #545--
 Because of the logic of going step-by-step: from go ing 
from HIV to hep C, hep C to other conditions, like 
medicines, like surgical procedures, radiological 
procedures.  You could see if no negligence had 
occurred but compensation was made, there is a whol e 
variety of health procedures that could be brought 
into play.

--Result #546--
 It's right to note, I think, that the settlement of
the HIV claims had not led to a general 
no-fault compensation scheme.

--Result #547--
 Just to put it, I think, in a fair context, what yo u 
say in your statement, and I'll just read this out,
I don't think we need to put it on screen, but in 
paragraph 2.69 of your statement: 
"I was asked to appear on a World in Action 
documentary broadcast on 7 October 1996 to set out the  
124 Government's position in relation to treatment for 
Hepatitis C sufferers.  This was my first appearanc e 
on a television broadcast as a Health Minister.  I was 
allowed a very short amount of time to answer a sma ll 
number of questions put to me as part of the wider 
broadcast." 
So that was how it came about.
If we go, please, Lawrence, to page 6.  I want 
to pick it up in the bottom half of the page.  You' ve 
got the heading "Comm", it says: 
"A single dose of factor eight is made by 
concentrating the clotting agent from thousands of 
blood donations.  In 1975 WIA [that's World in Acti on] 
first exposed how American down and outs were 
contaminating Britain's blood products." 
That's a reference to a 1975 documentary by 
World in Action.  Then what we see under the headin g 
"Archive Comm" is an extract from that 1975 
documentary which talks about money -- blood being 
sold, "bought from men who need money ... down on t he 
skid rows of America's big cities", and it talks ab out 
paid donors carrying 6 to 13 times the risk of havi ng 
hepatitis as volunteer donors, and they can pass it
on. 
If we then go to the bottom of the next page,                                   
 
                             25 please.  We can pick up at the very bottom of the 
page, again under the heading "Comm", and this is n ow 
the 1996 documentary again: 
"Many similarities have been drawn between HIV 
and hepatitis C.  They are both transmitted in bloo d 
and blood products like factor 8.  In 1990 the full
effects of hepatitis C were not yet known, but HIV 
positive haemophiliacs were dying of AIDS at the ra te 
of one a week.  Public opinion forced the governmen t 
to set-up a multimillion pound compensation fund." 
Then if we just go down the page a little the 
documentary then shows John Major in the House in 
December 1990 making that announcement.  Then we ge t 
to the heart of the issue in 1996: 
"The compensation only covered HIV victims 
infected before 1985.  After that all factor 8 was 
heat treated reducing the risk of viral contaminati on. 
Now the 3,000 haemophiliacs who were infected with 
Hepatitis C from the same contaminated blood produc ts 
want compensation too.  Today the government turned
them down." 
This is where we then get some of your answers: 
"At the end of the day [and this is you] I have 
to say it is better to spend money on health care, 
direct patient care for haemophiliacs, for  
126 haemophiliacs with hepatitis C, or indeed anybody e lse 
who is ill rather than compensation." 
That, I think, probably reflects the point you 
made a few moments ago, Lord Horam.  Then if we go 
back to the page, please.  There is then an 
intervention of an individual who was infected with
hepatitis C.  Then what's said is this: 
"I think that documentary [that's the 1975 
documentary] should be shown again and all the 
government should be made to watch it and see exact ly 
where those blood products came from." 
Just pausing there, did you ever watch the 1975 
documentary, Lord Horam, do you know, whether befor e 
or after this programme?

--Result #548--
 Then we can see it continues towards the bottom of the 
page that: 
"The Haemophilia Society will continue to fight 
for compensation.  They're now joined by another gr oup 
of people also infected with Hepatitis C -- patient s 
who've been given contaminated blood transfusions."
But I don't think there is anything particular 
further in your answers that I need to explore with
you. 
Can we then pick up the Parliamentary debate at 
the end of 1996, which you referred to earlier, 
Lord Horam.  This is at DHSC0041255_130. 
So this is 11 December 1996, so it's almost 
exactly a year on from the debate that we looked at
this morning.  We can see it starts with a speech f rom 
Mr Marshall, and if we look at the right-hand colum n, 
the third paragraph onwards, we can see Mr Marshall
identifying possible areas of fault, so he says:                                   
 
                             29 "The origin of the problem goes back to the 
1970s, when there was a failure to screen imported 
blood products.  My view is that that demonstrated 
negligence on the part of the Department of Health.
It was known at that time that, in the United State s, 
blood donors were paid for giving blood.  Those who
feel so hard up that they give pints of blood for 
money include drug addicts and others whose blood m ay 
well be infected.  The Department of Health must ha ve 
known of those risks." 
Then if we skip over the next paragraph and go 
to the one after: 
"So we are discussing the issue in the 1990s 
because there was some negligence and complacency i n 
the 1970s." 
Then if we go to the next paragraph, please, 
Lawrence, and this is all from Mr Marshall's speech : 
"The justification for giving assistance to 
haemophiliacs with HIV was that they faced a suspen ded 
sentence of death.  Indeed, many died fairly quickl y 
a full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
Others have lingered on, and, such are the advances  in 
medical science, some may do so for many years to 
come.  All who have lived have done so not knowing how 
long they would live.  Many found it difficult to g et  
130 a job, and certainly difficult to get a mortgage.  Of 
course, in the case of hepatitis C, there is 
difference, but it is only of degree. 
"Some of those infected with hepatitis C have 
already died.  Others will die prematurely.  There has 
been no official estimate." 
Then he goes on to deal with lack of an estimate 
on the part of the Department of Health or what's s aid 
to be a lack of an estimate and his own estimate.
Then if we go to the bottom of the page, 
Mr Marshall talks about the hardships suffered by 
those with hepatitis C.  I don't think need to read
that out. 
If we go to the next page, and we pick it up in 
the left-hand column, fourth paragraph down, so hav ing 
referred again to the case of the three brothers,
Mr Marshall says: 
"One would need the intellectual casuistry of 
a Treasury mandarin to justify such an action.  To say 
that one death is worthy of compensation, but that 
another is worth nothing at all is heartless and 
intellectually barren.  It is not only grieving 
relatives who find the differential unacceptable an d 
immoral -- more than 270 Members of Parliament have
signed Early Day Motion 4, asking for compensation to  
131 be paid.  The vast bulk of decent people find the 
differential unacceptable." 
Then if we go further down that column, please. 
In the second paragraph on the screen, Mr Marshall 
says this: 
"When my [honourable] Friend the Minister was 
asked earlier this year whether he would provide he lp,
he argued that the Department of Health budget shou ld 
be used for patient care.  Everyone accepts that th e 
Secretary of State and his Ministers should try to 
protect the Department of Health budget ... but the
argument that help should be denied because the hea lth 
budget must be protected is intellectually threadba re 
and immoral. 
"We all know that when the Macfarlane Trust was 
set up, for which measure our right [honourable] 
Friend the Leader of the House was responsible, no one 
said that the money would have to come out of the 
Department of Health's budget.  There is a thing 
called the contingency fund that can be used to bai l 
out Departments in such circumstances ..."
Then reference is made to the use of the 
contingency fund previously. 
Then if we go to the same page, please, 
Lawrence, but the top of the right-hand column --  
132 thank you.  Second paragraph, Mr Marshall says: 
"Thereafter, we have to look to the future. 
There will be merit in setting up an inquiry to hea r 
what outside experts say about the number of people
who will die and the extent of the hardship created ", 
and so on. 
So a passionate speech by Mr Marshall -- 

--Result #549--
 -- echoed just further down by Alf Morris.  And he 
says this in the second paragraph, third line: 
"The achievement of elementary justice for some 
very needful people is at the heart of our campaign , 
which, as the hon Member said, is now supported by 
more than 270 Members of Parliament of all parties.
Our campaign is also about the morality.  The 
Government accepted their moral responsibility in t he 
case of HIV infection in the course of national hea lth 
service treatment.  They now have the same 
responsibility in the hepatitis C cases." 
And he asserts:
"It is morally wrong to deny the victims of this 
appalling further tragedy in the haemophilia commun ity 
the modest help they seek." 
So those are the speeches to which you then 
responded, Lord Horam.                                   
 
                             33 We can see that -- just further down the same 
column, where you observe:
"It is almost exactly a year since we had 
a similar debate on this subject." 
Again, I'm not going to read all of it but if we 
can go to the next page.  You repeat -- and we see it, 
for example, in the third paragraph, on the left-ha nd 
side -- you repeat the information that we've seen set 
out in the Departmental documents and the letter to
the Reverend Tanner, so the "best treatment availab le 
in the light of medical knowledge available at the 
time".  And I think you say the same later in the 
speech. 
What I just want to do, finally, in this is if 
we look on the same page, Lawrence, bottom of the 
right-hand column.  This is, I think, setting out y our 
position, the Department's position, in terms of 
financial support as at December '96.  You say: 
"The Haemophilia Society subsequently wrote to 
me in June asking for the Government to set up a tr ust 
fund ..." 
And so on: 
"I took time to consider these proposals 
carefully before replying to the Haemophilia Societ y 
in October.  Most hon Members will by now be aware  
134 that I did not accept the society's proposals for 
payments for those infected with hepatitis C, but 
I stressed that I remained open to further argument s. 
I also outlined the support that we are giving to w ork 
with those infected, and to research in the area." 
Then third paragraph, you reject the suggestion 
that there has been negligence.  You repeat the 
concern about the development of a general 
no-fault compensation scheme.  
And in the next paragraph you say:
"We are not convinced that hepatitis C falls 
into the same special category." 
And then if I can just read the 
paragraph beginning "Secondly": 
"Secondly, as my hon Friend said, all of the 
proposals for payment schemes involve the expenditu re 
of substantial sums of public money.  I have 
considered a wide range of options for such schemes  -- 
I really have done that -- including the possibilit y 
of a scheme limited to those who go on to develop 
cirrhosis only.  But they all have significant cost s.
As a Health Minister, I have a duty to consider the
effect of such a sizeable sum on other health servi ce 
expenditure.  That duty has led me to conclude that
funds available to the NHS from whatever source, ar e  
135 best used in direct patient care." 
So that is you, is it not, on the record also 
saying that the Marshall scheme, the more modest 
proposal, is also rejected?

--Result #550--
   The final point I wanted to pick up, 
Lord Horam, about this parliamentary speech is -- i t's 
the bottom of the left-hand column and the top of t he 
right, so if we just pick it up at the bottom of th e 
left-hand, it's the last paragraph: 
"It has been suggested -- it was reiterated 
today by my hon Friend -- that there should be fund ing 
compensation sources other than from the national 
health service budget.  Naturally, I am sympathetic  to 
that suggestion.  Given that knowledge of how the 
Government work, hon and right hon Members who have
spoken in this debate will understand that those 
matters are not within the compass of my duties as 
Health Minister, and they must look to other Minist ers 
to put their case, particularly as regards the                                   
 
                             37 contingency fund ..."
And then you refer to the National Lottery.  And 
for reasons I don't need to explore with you, becau se 
they're perhaps obvious, the position is that's 
a matter to pursue through the national lottery if 
anyone wants to. 
But it's the suggestion that it would be for 
"other Ministers to put [a] case ... as regards [to ]
the contingency fund".  Do you know what you meant by 
that?

--Result #551--
 I'm just going to ask you to look at one document.  It 
pre-dates your time as minister, Lord Horam, so you 'll 
recall in a couple of documents that we've looked 
there is reference to the Secretary of State having
given evidence to a health select committee in July  of 
1995, and I just want to look at an extract of that
with you and then just explore a point with you.
So it's DHSC0042937_094. 
And we can see the second paragraph -- actually, 
I'm sorry, Lawrence, let's just put the first 
paragraph up, otherwise it doesn't make sense. 
So this is, I think, potentially Mr Marshall 
again, and he asks some questions about matters 
I don't need to trouble with you with, about the  
139 organisation of the Blood Service and purchase of 
blood bags, and then this question:
"Would you like to comment on  your views as to 
whether those who suffer a premature death through 
contaminated blood products, or contaminated blood 
should be compensated?"
Then Mr Dorrell says: 
"May I deal with the last question first?  My 
first exchange as a Health Minister some years ago 
with Mr Marshall was on this subject in an earlier 
case.  I believe that it remains true now as I 
asserted then that there is a choice to be made abo ut 
whether the Health Service uses its resources to 
compensate those who have suffered but through no 
fault of the Health Service where there has been a 
breakdown but without fault, whether that is a high er 
priority than the treatment of today and tomorrow's
patients.  I said then and I still believe it very 
strongly to be true that any patient who undertakes
a course of medicine must accept that there is a ri sk 
attached to modern medicine and in cases where 
a patient is damaged but without any fault.  I do n ot 
believe that it is a sensible use of NHS resources to 
provide compensation in those cases.  Of course tha t 
is in no sense to undermine the quite proper  
140 obligation that rests when things go wrong through 
somebody's negligence.  Where there is no fault, I am 
not in favour of compensation as a principle." 
Then if we go to the next page, bottom half of 
the page, someone, it may be Mr Marshall again, 
I don't know, I don't think it matters, says: 
"Can I back to the first part of the answer?
Would you not agree that there is something illogic al 
when those who have suffered an early death through
HIV are compensated but sometimes within the same 
family another haemophiliac suffered an early death
through cirrhosis of the liver, through hepatitis C , 
and has received no compensation at the all.  Do yo u 
not think that is worthy of re-examination, 
particularly as there are so few people involved?"
Then this was Mr Dorrell's answer: 
"I cannot deny that there is an illogicality 
there because the haemophiliac who contracted AIDS as 
a result of blood transfusion was provided with 
compensation in contravention of the principle whic h 
I enunciated to the Committee.  We can only give th e 
guarantee that there will be no illogicality if we 
extend the same form of compensation more generally
that we have done and I am not in favour of doing t hat 
for the reason I gave to the committee."                                   
 
                             41 Two matters arising out of that, Lord Horam, and 
recognising, as I do, that this pre-dates by a few 
months your arrival, but it's still Mr Dorrell who is 
Secretary of State when you're there.  Mr Dorrell 
appears to accept that there was no particularly go od 
reason for -- or to accept at least there is 
an illogicality in treating differently the HIV 
sufferer from the hepatitis C sufferer.  Do you rec all 
whether that potential illogicality was something t hat 
was ever discussed with him by you?

--Result #552--
 Then, secondly, it might be inferred from what he i s 
saying here that he thought that the Government had
already gone too far in providing what he calls 
compensation to those who had contracted AIDS.  Was
that something -- a view that you ever recall him 
raising with you or discussing with you?

--Result #553--
 Yes.  The Government -- or the Department of Health
policy of no-fault compensation was very important,
and therefore the ex gratia payment system that was 
51 established to help those suffering from haemophili a 
was regarded as a very special case, and I think it 's 
true to say that ring-fencing, not only would -- it
protects the Government from further payments, but 
also protects those who are within the ringfence fr om 
having the amount lessened because there are more 
cases involved. 
But the principle of ring-fencing in this 
situation was very much dominated by the fact that it 
was well known that people with haemophilia had the
double whammy, as it were, of having the HIV 
infections superimposed on their underlying illness .

--Result #554--

"Please find attached a submission from Mr Canavan.
PS(H) thinks that this is an issue on which S of S would
wish to take the decision."
Then if we look at the attached submission
, 
it's
at DHSC0003641_004.
The submission itself from Mr Canavan is dated
13
 
August 1991, addressed to PS(H)'s office.  I think we
need only look
, 
for present purposes
, 
at paragraphs 1
and 3
, 
so if we can scroll down slightly
,
 please
,
Lawrence
.
 
2
Paragraph 1 says:
"PS(H) may recall that Graham Ross of J Keith Park
& Co has written to 
Ministers 
on several occasions
pressing for compensation for the blood transfusion
recipients infected with HIV.  With Ministers agreement,
officials have taken over the correspondence.
Graham Ross expressed some concern at this but has been
assured 
that
 Ministers will be told of any new
arguments.  This submission considers a point of
particular concern to Mr Ross that preserving the
anonymity of blood donors could make it difficult for
the blood transfusion recipients to seek redress through
the courts."
I'll read 
the
 second:
"In the submission we are also reporting the 
RHA's
[Regional Health Authorit
y's
] willingness to take the
lead in negotiating a deal 
to settle the blood
transfusion issue, should Ministers wish to seek such
a settlement.
"
Then the recommendation in paragraph 3:
"We do not consider that these developments in
themselves warrant a change in the Government's
position.  However
, 
should Ministers be minded to seek
a way of settling the blood transfusion issue
 
the
J Keith Park
 
and RHA developments may be helpful in
 
3
reducing the risk of wider repercussions."
The
 submission then goes 
on 
to set out in more
detail the issue about anonymity of donors and the
impact 
that might have on the ability 
to litigate
.  
I'm not going to read any of that out.  
If we 
just go to page 3, please.  If we 
pick it up
at paragraph 9, conclusions.  At the top of the page:
"In the view of officials, the arguments about
donor anonymity do not warrant a concession to the blood
transfusion recipients infected with HIV.  However
 
if
Ministers were minded to seek a way of settling the
issue then the arguments might be used to prevent the
settlement as a necessary measure to protect our
voluntary blood donor system.  However
 
any such argument
would have to be used with caution as any erosion of
public interest immunity principle could have serious
implications for all Government Departments and for
other public bodies.  There would need to be
consultation with these other interests."
Then if we go down to the bottom of the page under
the heading "Decisions Required":
"
13.  
We are asking PS(H) whether:
"
i) he is content that officials should inform
J Keith Park that the Government's position on
compensation for the blood transfusion cases is
 
4
unchanged by the arguments about donor anonymity?
"
ii) he wishes any further action taken at this
stage to pursue the RHAs offer?"
Lord Waldegrave
, 
as we 
saw
 from the covering
submission
, 
this appears to have been passed up the
ministerial chain to you, 
but 
the documents I think
don't tell us what
,
 if any
,
 decision you took in
response to this.  Do you have any independent
recollection of it?

--Result #555--

Then continuing with the minute:
 
7
"
4.  
We must also assume that 
Treasury
 would not
entertain any further bids on the Reserve for additional
cases.
"
5.  
On policy, this extension of eligibility will
leave us with a less secur
e r
ingfence than for
haemophiliacs.  We believe that two groups of people,
those infected with hepatitis and those 
treated 
with
human growth hormone, are currently preparing legal
action against the Department.  Both groups will be able
to argue that
 
like the HIV cases
 
they were entitled to
expect safe treatment.  And 
the
 hepatitis cases will
also be able to point to infection through blood.  So we
will be more vulnerable than 
we
 now are on the no-fault
compensation issue."
Then we can see if we go further down, that's the
end of the minute.
So it looks from those two documents,
Lord Waldegrave, that by the end of November of 1991,
you had taken the decision, discussed it with Mr Heppell
and others, that the time had come to change the
departmental line and extend financial support to those
infected with HIV through transfusion.  Do you have any
recollection of exactly how and when that came about
?
Because
, as 
I say
, 
there's a dearth of documents really
between August and November
.
 
8

--Result #556--

If we go to paragraph 8 we can see the recommendation to
Mr Mellor is:
"We recommend that you try to dissuade
Mr Waldegrave and colleagues from offering
a compensation scheme.  It may seem attractive to him in
the short-term
.  
But in the longer term
, 
it could cost
much more by leading to a no-fault compensation scheme -
even if one restricted to medical negligence."
So the suggestion is Mr Mellor tries to talk you
out of it
, 
if I can put it that way.
If we go back to the first page and just read the
handwritten entry:
"This 
is 
a longstanding dilemma
.  
It is not
comfortable to deny compensation to this group when the
haemophiliacs can get it.  But giving compensation to
them 
[
would
]
 mean another long stride down the slipp
ery
slope to no-fault compensation generally.  I am afraid,
therefore, 
our
 
advice has to 
be against 
[
it
]
."
I will check whose handwriting that is.

--Result #557--

Sir Christopher France, yes, sorry.
2 December 1991, 
to your Private Office
.  
And if we
go down to the text of it
, 
it says:
"
1.  
I
 have 
seen Mr Heppell's minute of 29
November.  I
 
very much share his misgivings on the
policy case for a concession here (and the finance would
not be easy either).
"2.  
It is never very comfortable to resist claims
for compensation from those who have encountered major
problems through no fault of their
 
own or anyone else.
But unless Government is prepared to 
draw a
 line and
stick to it, it will end up with a de facto
(very
 
expensive) no
-
fault compensation system
.
"
3.  
The ringfence around the haemophiliacs is
bound to be attacked
, 
but we are unlikely ever to find
a better one if we abandon it.  The haemophiliacs were
doubly disadvantaged by their existing, hereditary
disease which already affected their position on
employment, insurance and the like.  They can be
 
15
separate from other victims of medical accidents, but
the next defensible boundary is not easy to see.
I advise long reflection before 
we
 move further in to
no-fault compensation for medical accidents.  Is this
really the most pressing marginal case 
for 
the
deployment of money from the health programme?"
Now, you've told us you would have regular
meetings, the top of the office meetings, with
Sir Christopher and others.  This 
is, 
I think
, 
perhaps
the only example we have of Sir Christopher putting his
views on this issue in writing.  Does the fact that it
was set out in this formal way rather than simply being
conveyed to you in your weekly meetings a reflection of
the extent to which he was opposed to your proposal?

--Result #558--

If 
we
 just pick matters up in your statement
,
 please
,
WITN5288001, if we go to page 88, paragraph 4125, you
say this, and it's referring to Christopher France's
advice:
"While I do not now actively remember seeing this
advice
, 
I would certainly have done so at the time.
This was advice coming from (respectively) the
Permanent
 
Secretary [Sir Christopher France] and
the
 
Deputy
 
Secretary
 (
Grade 2) Civil Servant
[Strachan Heppell] heading the policy area, both of whom
that
 put their advice in formal minutes.  The Inquiry
asks why I 'rejected' their advice.  They were right to
warn
 me in the terms they did
, 
and I would have taken
very
 serious note of their advice.  I would have been
well aware of the dangers of widening the policy
, 
and
their advice would - appropriately - have been
a force
ful
 reminder of those risks.  Ultimately,
however, it was for ministers to judge the balance of
risks.  Here the balance was between trying to maintain
a distinction between haemophiliacs and blood
transfusion patients both infected with HIV by
NHS
 
treatment which the 'court of public opinion'
rejected, versus the weakening of the defences against
pressure for no-fault compensation which we believed to
be an unacceptable outcome for the reasons 
(
agreed by
 
20
Parliament
) 
put forward in opposition to Rosie Barnes
'
Bill. 
 
Such difficult 
judgements 
are I think the essence
of democra
tic 
government.  Just as my senior officials
were right to 
warn
, I think that the Government was
right to concede and run the risk on the no-fault
compensation concerns.  As I was later to express it to
the Chief Secretary, I
 
believed that it was politically
and morally the correct course.  I was 
very
 aware of the
particular stigma and fear that surrounded AIDS at the
time
, 
and I did see this as a potentially distinguishing
feature from other cases raised in the debate on
no-fault compensation."
The balance that you identify there
, 
the balance
of risks being a matter for ministers to judge,
presumably -- and this is a more generally question,
Lord Waldegrave -- the more senior the Minister
, 
the
easier or perhaps the less difficult it may be for that
minister to consider but reject the advice of senior
officials?

--Result #559--

Then if we just pick it up with the Treasury response to
 
27
you
.
HMTR0000003_051.
This 
is 1
3
 
January 1992 from Mr Mellor.  It refers
to your letter and to the letters from Ian Lang,
Peter Brooke and David Hunt, and then Mr Mellor says
this:
"
2.  
I understand why you want to provide
compensation for this unfortunate group and
I sympathise.  But I also have serious reserv
ations
about whether it would be possible realistically to 
ring
fence
 any such compensation.  There are a range of other
groups who have also suffered as a result of treatment
under the NHS where there
 is 
no
 question of negligence.
By compensating those acquiring HIV from blood
transfusion, we will be taking a further long stride
towards no-fault compensation in general.
"3.  
Virginia Bottomley put forward a good defence
of our current position in the adjournment 
debate called
by
 Gavin Strang on 20
 
December.  It would be difficult
to reverse our position so soon after that clear
statement
.  
"4.  
But I also have to say that all this 
is
overtaken by the extent of doctors
' 
and den
tists'
overpayments in the current year.  You will appreciate
that the latest news about 
the 
further 
over
payments to
 
28
dentists this year has come as a 
very unpleasant shock.
Your officials have now told mine that the 
gross
overpayment
 
to dentists this year is likely to be
a staggering £8,000 per dentist at the very least.  That
comes to 
well
 over £100 million which you will be
looking to me to provide from the Reserve.  I have also
learn
ed 
from officials 
that 
there will be 
claims for
overpayments this year for Scotland and Wales.
It brings the 
cumulative overpayment to doctors and
dentists to over half a billion pounds
, 
more 
than the
total increases many 
colleagues received in their 1991
Survey settlements.
"5.  
In these circumstances, you leave 
me no 
room
to help you or the other health departments by providing
additional access to the Reserve for the blood
transfusion patients.  I cannot
,
 therefore
,
 agree to
what you propose."

scheme?
And I don't think we need to go to the all of the
further documents but
, 
again for the transcript, you
wrote to Mr Mellor 
on 
12
 
February
, 
it's DHSC0002582_003
,
in which you explained you'd look at the programme to
work out where you would find the money from and there's
some additional correspondence on that which I don't
think we need to look at
.
If we then come to the announcement in Parliament
,
to complete the chronological picture
, 
it's at
 
35
DHSC0003625_040.  It's a written answer
17
 
February 1992, and if we just go down to you are
response to the question, you say:
"Pursuant to the reply of 14
 
November 1991 at
column
 
656; I have decided that 
the
 special provision
already made for those with haemophilia and HIV is to be
extended to those who have been infected with HIV as
a
 
result of National Health Service blood transfusion or
tissue transfer in the United Kingdom.  The payments
will also apply to any of their spouses, partners and
children to whom their infection may have been passed
on.  The rates of payment are shown in the table.
Similar help will be available throughout the UK.
"The Government have never accepted the argument
for a general scheme of no
 
fault compensation for
medical accidents, as such a scheme would be unworkable
and unfair.  That remains our position
.
"We made special provision for those with
haemophilia and HIV because of their very special
circumstances.  It has been argued that this special
provision should be extended to include those who have
become
 infected with HIV through blood or tissue
transfer within the UK.  I have considered very
carefully all the circumstances and the arguments which
have been put to us.  I have concluded that it would be
 
36
right to recognise that this group
, 
who share the
tragedy of those with haemophilia in becoming infect
ed
with HIV through medical treatment within the UK
, 
is
also a very special case."
Then over the page:
"The circumstances of each infected transfusion or
tissue recipient will need to be considered individually
to establish that their treatment in the UK was the
source of their infection."
The next paragraph then deals with the
establishment of the panel and the work on the mechanics
of dealing with claims.
The third paragraph explains that:
"Parliamentary authority for making these payments
will be sought through Suppl
y 
Estimates and the
confirming 
Appropriation Act
.  
On the basis of the
reported cases the estimated cost could be 
£
12 million
.
However
, 
I cannot be certain about the cost
, 
as numbers
of valid claims are not known
.
"
And that picks up on the issue we picked up a few
minutes ago
 --

--Result #561--

Can I then turn to a handful of broader issues.  One of
the concerns about the establishment of precedent and
the impact in terms of the policy against no-fault
compensation was based on an assumption that there was
no fault involved on the part of the NHS or on
governments.

--Result #562--

Would it, having regard to the material we've looked at,
be right to understand
, 
then, 
that
 obviously there were
cases where there might be negligence and legal
liability and so compensation might follow in those
cases, there was the policy against no-fault
compensation.

--Result #563--

You
 have
 produced 
a
 report, the infected 
blood
compensation study entitled "Compensation and redress
for the victims of infected blood, recommendations for
a
 framework".  We will obviously be coming back to the
content of that time and again today and tomorrow.
I 
just 
want to 
start by 
look
ing
 at how you came to be
appointed
.

--Result #564--

So there are 
a
 handful of documents we will go
through.  
Could 
we have
, 
please
, 
RLIT0001123.  This is
an
 announcement -- 
a
 written Parliamentary statement
made on 25 March 2021 by Penny Mordaunt
, 
the then
Paymaster General
?
If we go to the second page
, 
please
, 
Lawrence
,
we have the heading "Compensation Framework".  
So 
if
we can have those paragraphs highlighted:
"To meet the Government's 
commitment
 to consider 
a
 framework for compensation, we can confirm our 
intention to appoint 
an
 independent reviewer to carry 
out 
a
 study
, 
looking at options for 
a
 framework for 
compensation
, 
and to report back to the 
Paymaster General with recommendations
, 
before the 
Inquiry reports. 
"The terms of reference of this study will be 
finalised in consultation between the independent 
reviewer and those infected and affected.  The study 
will include consideration of the scope and levels of 
such compensation, and the relationship between 
a
 compensation framework and the existing financial 
support schemes in place. 
"The study is entirely separate from the public 
inquiry, which continues to have this Government's 
full support; it will not duplicate the work of the 
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  5
Inquiry
, 
or cut across the Inquiry's find
ings
.  The 
study shall provide the Paymaster General with advice 
on potential compensation framework design and 
solutions which can be ready to implement upon the 
conclusion of the Inquiry should the Inquiry's 
find
ings
 and recommendations require it. 
"The name of the independent reviewer will be 
announced shortly." 
That
 
is
 the initial statement and that is
a
 broad description of what it is you then became the
independent reviewer to undertake
.

--Result #565--

Now the terms of reference for your study are at
RLIT0001125.  I'm not going to read them aloud, I'm
just going to identify the headings.  So:
"Rationale for compensation
.
  
 
6
"
Independent advice to Government
. 
 
"
Scope of compensation
. 
 
"
Categories of injury and loss.   
"
Types of award and method of assessment." 
Over the page:
"Measures for compensation.   
"
Relationship with current schemes.   
"
Options for administering the scheme.   
"
Other issues. 
"Reporting to the Government by February 2022
", 
which I think was subsequently put back by two weeks 
to the middle of March 2022
.
 

--Result #566--

You were essentially asked as 
an
 experienced lawyer to
come up with 
a
 review of what might be 
a
 fair and
proper compensation scheme
?

--Result #567--

Yes.  I think it fair to say I regarded my task as to
try and produce 
a
 framework of compensation independent
of this Inquiry and I think the text of my report
probably shows that.  But
,
 yes
,
 you are correct.

--Result #568--

We will come back to some detailed issues relating to
the scope of that recommendation 
at
 
a
 late
r s
tage.
 
18
But if we pick up your report at RLIT0001129 and we go
to, first of all, page 10.  I just want to read out
two or three passages concerning interim payment and
then ask you a little about it.
So at paragraph 1.10
, 
under the heading "The
pressures of time
", 
you say this:
"Unfortunately, 
a
 disadvantage from the point of 
view of those who might be eligible for compensation, 
is that there is little or no prospect of the scheme 
getting going before the conclusion of the Inquiry.  
This is unfortunate for the many potentially eligible 
applicants who are now of advanced years or worryingly 
unwell.  There are those who fear they will not 
survive long enough to see, let alone enjoy, the 
fruits of 
an
 award of compensation.  This is 
a
 principle reason why I have recommended the unusual 
measure of 
an
 immediate interim award to 
those
 
infected persons who are already beneficiaries of the 
existing support schemes, in anticipation of, but 
before, the scheme has been set up.  If at all 
possible, it is 
a
 matter of justice that so far as 
possible the infected likely to receive compensation 
can receive at least 
a
 significant part of it in time 
to make 
a
 disposition of the award as part of their 
assets before they die." 
 
19
Then if we turn to page 29
, 
please.  Top of the
page, paragraph 2.69 you say:
"There is 
a
 compelling case for awarding interim 
payments as soon as possible to the infected who have 
already been accepted as eligible for the support 
schemes.  Many wish to be able to settle their affairs 
before they die.  Challenging though it is to do this 
before the scheme has been set up and is fully 
operational, and before the conclusions of the Inquiry 
are available, I suggest that such 
a
 payment should be 
made now reflecting the minimum any infected person 
could be expected to receive under the scheme.  I have 
suggested this is unlikely to be less than £100,000 in 
any case.  Naturally
, 
any such payment would be on 
account of any final award
, 
and may suffice for some 
who might not wish to proceed further." 
Then if we go to
 
page 122.  Under the heading
"Interim payments" you set out
, 
in paragraphs 9.128
through to 9.137
, 
in a little more detail your
thinking about the issue of 
an
 interim payment
, 
and
referring
, 
in 
particular
 in paragraph 9.128
, 
the fear
of many that they have not got long to live.
You describe there 
a
 compelling case but also
that 
it's, 
in some respects
, 
a
 relatively unusual step
to take.  In your own words
, 
Sir Robert, what was it
 
20
that led you to make
, 
in fairly strong terms
, 
this
recommendation?

--Result #569--

I think principally the impact the stories I heard and
read had on me
, 
as I believe they would have on anyone
in relation to the dreadful experience the infected, if
I can use that term, have had.  And 
the pressing
need -- 
and 
it 
underlay the whole 
setting
 up of this
review
 -- 
for people to be
 -- 
know
 
that there was
something on the way, that their affairs could be
settled as they got older and before they died.
The Government were clearly correct in the
response we have had to say that the issues around
this are very complex and
 -- 
across government
, 
and it
was clear to me, 
as 
I wrote what was not 
a
 simple
report, 
that
 it would take time to set that up,
whenever the starting gun
 
was fired for that
, 
and it
seemed to me that if the principle of compensation was
accepted
 -- 
if
 -- 
that something -- to wait until
a
 fully fledged scheme had been set up and then set
about giving compensation would be too late for many
to achieve the justice they sought.
I was also influenced
, 
I think
, 
by the
remarkable achievements of the 9/11 Compensation Fund
in the United States
, 
which I deal with in
an
 appendix
, 
where there actually the scheme was set
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  21
up within months actually.  But 
that -- 
the
circumstances and political background to that were
very different
, 
but what I think I learnt from that is
that the sooner you can get compensation into people's
hands
, 
the more effective it is.  So that's why
,
amongst other reasons
, 
I put in my report
I recommended this.
I also felt that if the entitlement to
an
 interim payment was limited to those who were
already deemed to be eligible by the support scheme,
as
 an
 infected person, identifying people and
determining their eligibility should be quite easy
compared to more complex assessments required for say
new categor
ies 
of eligible people 
or
 others who hadn't
yet got on the support scheme.  
So 
I thought even if
the scheme hadn't been actually set up
, 
there was
a
 mechanism and
,
 
indeed
,
 
an
 administration through
which 
an
 interim payment should be made
.

--Result #570--

As I read this part of your report, the
 
two things you
called on the Government to do, or 
that 
you
recommended to the Government that they do now, whilst
they took
,
 then
,
 the time to consider some of the
longer term issues in more detail, was to accept in
principle the 
setting
 up
,
 again
,
 of 
a
 compensation
scheme
, 
and then to offer the
 
immediate interim
 
22
payment which
, 
as you say in your report
, 
could be
done through the existing scheme
, 
so it didn't need to
wait for what might be some complex machinery of 
a
 new
scheme
?

--Result #571--

What I want to do next then is just to do 
a
 quick
overview of your recommendations, to get 
an
 idea of
the shape of what it is and the scope of what it is
you are recommending
, 
and then to look at different
aspects of it in more detail.
You will appreciate
, 
Sir Robert
, 
a
 lot of what
I ask are those representing Core
 
Participants
, 
and
 
23
those 
representing those who
 are infected and
affected
, 
have been
 -- 
put forward issues that they
are keen to understand your thinking and know in more
detail how things might work if your recommendations
were accepted.
So if we go back in the report
, 
to the executive
summary, which starts on page 15
 -- 
I'm going to come
back to the question of compensation and 
moral
 case in
principles
, but -- 
so if we go over to the bottom of
the next page
, 
we see there the heading "Coverage of
compensation".
In terms of the infections that would trigger
entitlement to compensation under the scheme that you
have suggested.  You have suggested compensation for
hepatitis C and for HIV
.

--Result #572--

Yes, the trouble with any definition of eligibility is
that there are 
likely to be
 cases that come out,
particular
ly 
in -- 
where there are complex social and
family situations
.  
And it 
calls -- it 
is 
a
 potential
extension because probably at Common Law many people in
this category who suffered 
a
 mental injury
 
wouldn't be
able to claim damages
, 
for instance
 for
 negligence
, but
it struck me that there were people, both in the more
clear eligible categories and this rather in
choate
category for whom there was 
a
 strong moral case for
compensation
.

--Result #573--

In terms then of the types of awards
, 
if we go to
page 23.  So 
an
 infected individual or their estate
who is eligible, you have identified in paragraph 2.36
five components to the compensation
: 
injury impact
award
, 
and that's 
to 
reflect both physical and mental
suffering.

--Result #574--

-- 
a little bit with each other and there may need to
be, 
I think 
looking at this, further work done about
how you define this
.  
But it seemed to me that to be
bound by the categories of damages recognised in 
Harvey
McGregor's law of damages would be too limiting
, and --
but if there
's
 to be 
a
 compensation scheme
, that 
there
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  29
was
 
an
 opportunity to look at things in 
a
 slightly
different way to reflect the real injuries that people
were telling me they were suffering from
.

--Result #575--

  
We can see from the paragraph immediately
 
35
below that you have suggested that 
a
 past waiver of
litigation rights should
n't
 be 
a
 barrier to
compensation and that there shouldn't be 
a
 waiver of
litigation rights 
required
 to claim compensation.
I
'll
 come back to what you 
say
 the 
inter
relationship
might be between awards under this scheme, court
awards and 
indeed
 what account might need to be taken
of previous payments, current payments and benefits in
due course.
So that
's
 the basic architecture of the
structure of compensation.
In terms of the scheme that would deliver it,
you considered 
a
 number of other schemes
, 
and we will
look at some of them
, 
but you considered the bespoke
individual assessment model that's used
, 
for
 
example
,
in the Republic of Ireland under the Tribunal
established there
 --

--Result #576--

The model that appealed to me -- I came up with that
having regard to the -- it sounds in 
a
 completely
different area really but the criminal injuries
compensation scheme which has 
a
 tariff for 
virtually
 
38
every conceivable type of injury you might suffer at
the hands of 
a
 criminal.  
In
 
a
 sense, whereas here
where you are obviously dealing with 
a
 limited number
of conditions
, 
albeit 
very 
serious ones with lots of
complexity within them
, 
and it seemed to me that if we
could come up -- or 
a
 scheme could come up with 
a
 grid
and categories of severe, moderate and less serious,
you could slot people into those and within each of
those there would be 
a
 range of figures to recognise
that one point would be 
a
 
bit
 artificial to reflect the
many variations -- everyone I saw's condition 
was it
seem
ed 
to be entirely different to everyone else's
, so
you 
do 
need to recognise that to some extent.  But it
is much simpler if every
one 
knows 
that actually I'm
okay since it's 
in that grid and what we are talking
about is 
the difference between 
that figure and this
figure
.

--Result #577--

You would then need 
a
 team of assessors and I think
I have said ideally they should be lawyers experienced
in the field, as I believe they are with the criminal
injuries compensation scheme.
An
 alternative would be to train assessors to
make those judgments.  Personally I think in the long
run
 -- 
although lawyers are notoriously thought to be
more expensive for doing it that way, 
I think 
in the
long run I think it would be cheaper to have people
who have real experience 
in 
this doing that job
,
rather than people who had been trained up for this
 
44
particular
 purpose
.

--Result #578--

Yes.  Arm's length bodies 
hold -- 
I should say they are
not politically popular in all quarters because it is
another bureaucracy
, 
it costs money to set up.  It
seem
ed
 to me that the need 
of
 this 
particular
ly group
of people were such and the need 
for independence from
government was such that 
an
 independent body was
needed
, 
which
, of course, 
is funded by the government
and 
ultimately 
there is 
a
 form of government oversight
of
 it, but legally they are responsible for their own
decisions and run things in their own way.
One of the issues that became very clear to me,
certainly from the people I met and from the
correspondence we had, was that there is no --
a
 complete absence of trust on the part of many
infected and affected people of the government because
of their experience over many years
, 
and if they are
to have trust in 
a
 system of compensation they would
require it to be independent.  The sort of pragmatic
 
46
need for that is that unless the victims
 -- 
and I call
them victims for this purpose, people who might make
a
 claim
 -- 
are confident in the system that's offered
to them, they won't go down that route
, 
they will
still want to litigate
, 
if they can
, 
and
, 
of course
,
there may be obstacles in the way of that
, 
but it 
will
mean 
this is not -- 
this issue is not solved
.

--Result #579--

Recommendation 7 relates to aggravated and exemplary
damages.  We will come back to those concepts in
a
 while.
Over the page
, 
recommendation 8 then sets out
the five heads of awards that you recommend for those
who were infected
, 
so
: 
the injury impact, social
impact
, 
care
, 
autonomy and financial loss awards.
Recommendation 9 sets out your recommendations
for heads of award for those who were affected
.
Recommendation 10 is essentially, although you
avoided giving figures, as I understand it, you were
suggesting that the rate should broadly reflect Common
Law damages and other compensation schemes
.
 
48

--Result #580--

I thought it necessary to provide some guidance for
that and for there to be 
a
 relationship between the
compensation under this scheme and the Common Law in
order to promote proportionality and
 -- and 
fairness
,
to be honest.

--Result #581--

Just a personal -- and it is a personal view, but I'm
an independent reviewer and 
asked to put a review
forward, that to bedevil this area with legal -- strict
legal position about negligence is to overcomplicate
things
, 
and I appreciate when Government ministers say
this should not have happened, 
that
 
is
 
a
 very high
level 
almost -- 
not superficial, but it is 
a
 high level
undetailed examination of what is 
a
 very complicated
picture.  But if the general feeling is this is
something that should not have happened and in
retrospect there were ways of stopping it happening,
then 
it seems to me that in itself is 
a
 strong moral
case for compensation
.

--Result #582--

  
Sir Robert, 
I've
 identified in your
statement what you have described as the principles
which should underpin 
a
 compensation scheme
, 
and if we
could just look at those.
If we could have the report back, 
Lawrence,
page 60.
You set out there in paragraph 4.75 
a
 range of
principles
: 
"
Remedial
 ...
"
Respect for dignity: The scheme must restore
and preserve applicants' dignity and treat them with
respect and confidentiality
.
 
58
"Collaborative: The scheme should be 
collaborative with
, 
and supportive of, applicants and, 
so far as possible, avoid 
an
 adversarial approach to 
claims
: 
applicants should be believed unless the 
contrary 
is
 proved
.
 
"Choice
: 
The scheme should respect and enhance 
the autonomy of applicants, including offering 
a
 choice of how remedies are delivered
.
 
"
Individualised ...
 
[
reflect
ing]
 individual 
circumstances and experience 
..."
 
I'll come back to that
 
"
Inclusive
 ...
 
"Non-technical: There should be no bar to 
eligibility based on technical issues ..."
 
"
Accessible ... 
readily accessible, 
understandable and free of complexity and stress ...  
"
Ease of proof
: 
Unjust
, distressing and 
disproportionate requirements of proof and evidence 
should be avoided." 
Then:
"Broad ...  
"
Improving
: 
No claim
ant for compensation should 
be worse off than they 
would be without such 
a
 scheme ..." 
Then, 
over the page:
 
59
"Complementary: The continuing payments under 
the existing support schemes should be continued
, 
and 
made more secure 
regardless
 of any claim for, or award 
of, compensation." 
Then:
"Holistic
: 
Compensation is not just about money, 
but should also include consideration of material 
means to compensate for what has been lost." 
Would it be right to understand that,
particular
ly the reference to respect, collaboration,
choice, accessibility, ease of proof and so on, that
those principles have been identified by you because
they reflect some of the problems or concerns or
unhappiness that those infected and their families
have had in dealing with schemes over the years
?

--Result #583--

Yes
, 
I received I think strong messages about all those
matters in the submissions, information given to me
,
and I think what I was trying to do here was partly to
synthesise 
that but also the very helpful submissions
I received from some RLRs, which appear in the
appendix
.  
The order
, 
I'm afraid
, 
is not -- if you ask
me about the logic of the order there might not be one
but I think 
they're all 
probably important features
,
and 
it passe
d
 the moral code too.
It is 
a
 very 
particular
 feature of what I was
 
60
hearing of what people had gone through that they felt
there had been 
a
 lack -- respect for them was
significantly missing.  Their ability 
to 
choose things
had gone.  They lacked information.  All these things
it seemed to me that there was 
a
 risk that any scheme
of compensation could make some of those things worse
and it was very important that it shouldn't do that
but 
actually 
should do the opposite
.

--Result #584--

Well, 
obviously 
it's 
extremely important, 
and 
there is
the explicit underpinning
,
 if you like
,
 of everything
else I
've
 recommended in terms of awards
, so 
it appears
to be the case that some of the previous schemes have
suffered through limitation of funding in the sense
that 
a
 lump sum is provided and 
the 
struggle 
h
as 
been
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  61
how to distribute that.  This is start
ing
 the other way
round
, 
their compensation scheme
, 
which is that people
will be eligible for 
an
 assessment of amounts which are
to 
a
 large extent capable of 
being
 judged objectively.
Clearly that doesn't work if the funding is not
available to them.
I appreciate that probably means that funding
has to be to some extent open-ended.  Obviously
estimates 
will 
need to be made about what is required
and when in just the same way
, 
if I may put it this
way
, 
that NHS resolutions administration of the
damages schemes for the National Health Service is 
in
a
 sense 
an
 open-ended budget, in that they have to pay
whatever is 
determined by way of settlement or award
in damages claim
s
.  Any arm's length body for this
scheme would require 
a
 similar approach to funding but
in 
a
 way that's -- 
I mean, 
without that you can't have
a
 compensation scheme.

--Result #585--

I want to come back tomorrow and deal with certain
particular
 issues relating to the approach to damages
in Scotland
.  
But in broad terms
, 
would it be right to
say that you have drawn more from the approach to
awarding compensation in England
?

--Result #586--

Yes
, 
I think that's fair
, 
and that may be either
a
 strength or 
a
 weakness, 
whichever 
you 
prefer
 to see
it.  I think 
the -- 
overarching that would be 
a
 message
that the compensation awarded should be
, you know,
subject to
 
individual circumstances, but the same
principle should be adopted whether you are in England,
Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales
.

--Result #587--

In terms of other compensation schemes
, 
you have
referred obviously to the scheme in the Republic of
Ireland.  You
've
 referred to the September 11th Victim
Compensation Fund and the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Scheme.
You
've
 explained in your report that you had
access to both
, 
I think
, 
a
 textbook which looked at
compensation schemes around the world and then there
is 
a
 summary of some of that in 
a
 PowerPoint.  We
don't need to put it on screen but the reference for
those who want to look at it is 
SLFS0000002.
 
63
Were there any other 
particular
 compensation
schemes or features of compensation schemes elsewhere
in the world that struck you as either particularly
useful or something which should be avoided
?

--Result #588--

Well, the textbook which you mentioned is really
helpful in giving me 
a
 sort of world view of
compensation schemes
, 
and is well worth 
a
 read if you
are interested in such things.
What came through to me was that all
compensation schemes are different and they all arise
out of 
a
 social, legal and maybe sometimes 
a
 political
context.  So schemes
, 
for instance
, 
that are often
referred to when we are talking about compensation
here tend to be New Zealand, some of the Scandinavian
countries.  When you actually look at those they do
have many features which I think would accord with the
principles I put forward
.  
But 
a
 lot of them,
particularly
,
 say
,
 in Sweden
, 
are there because they
are run and supported by 
a
 sort of structure of
insurance companies and so on
, 
and this is 
a
 way of
bringing together the obligation of insurance
companies, the liabilities of the state and so on
,
which isn't quite where we are here.
So quite 
a
 lot of schemes
, 
it seems to me
, 
have
an
 origin
, 
and so in New Zealand they brought
 
64
together
 -- 
they now have 
a
 scheme which 
has 
brought
together various streams of compensation from all
sorts of different areas, motor insurers, medical and
so on
, 
and 
so 
lead to something which 
perhaps 
becomes
even more complicated
, one
 might say
, 
than what I'm
recommending here.
So the ones I picked
, 
and it is obviously
a
 subjective selection, I thought were illustrations
of some of the good things about schemes but also some
of the challenges.  One you haven't mentioned, 
and
I haven't mentioned yet is the -- 
because it
's
 still
topical
 
is 
the Windrush Scheme and the Home Affairs
Committee's report about that
, 
which 
I think 
is 
a
 very
useful reminder of the difficulties 
that
 can arise in
relation to schemes if they are not very carefully
thought through in consultation with the people who
are intended to benefit from them.

--Result #589--

I want to turn now in more detail to some of the
specific recommendations.  I'm going to start with
recommendation 2
, 
and recommendation 2, if we just go
back to -- I will just pluck out the relevant pages of
the recommendations
.  
I think it is about page 30
something of the report.  Page 33.
So recommendation 2 was the scheme offering
redress to those infected with 
HCV and/or 
HIV
 -- I
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  65
obviously don't intend to ask you about the inclusion
of those
 -- 
and then defined serious cases of
hepatitis B.  I just want to ask you a little more
about hepatitis B.
If we go to page 62
, 
please.  Under the heading
"Conclusions on Coverage
" 
you explain your reasons for
approaching hepatitis B in the way that you did.  So
you said:
"Of necessity, this very generalised view of the 
impact HBV can have is based on 
a
 reading largely of 
the expert evidence to the Inquiry.  It was not 
a
 subject which the infected raised at our meetings, 
although I have been pressed in written submissions to 
include HBV infections as 
a
 category of eligibility
.
 
"
4.84  
On the basis of the description of HBV 
and its effects, which I hope is 
a
 fair one, I am 
unable to recommend that this infection 
be included in 
a compensation scheme as a separate category, with one 
exception.  I consider a number of factors distinguish 
HBV from HCV." 
Then there are four bullet points 
there 
sets
out
.  The first was that
:
"
- 
Generally
, 
the effects of HBV
 -- 
while it may 
be 
a long lasting infection -- are mild or even 
non-existent, so far as the impact on the quality of 
 
66
life of the infected 
is concerned.  Compensation in 
such cases would be likely to be low and it is 
possible the costs of processing claims for it would 
be disproportionate
.
 
"
- 
There is available effective treatment which 
is likely to suppress the disease and avoid the more 
serious consequences with regard to the liver
.
 
"
- 
Many cases where there are more serious 
consequences are likely to be where there is HBV/HCV 
or HBV/HIV co-infection." 
Then your last bullet point:
"
- 
In the absence of the more serious infections 
it may be difficult to establish causation." 
Then your exception is set out in 4.85
, 
those
:
"... 
who develop 
a
 chronic infection with
serious symptoms who require treatment to prevent
cirrhosis
, 
or who have actually contracted cirrhosis
.
"
So 
is it right to understand that those who fall
within paragraph 4.85 you would recommend they are
compensated within the framework of the scheme
?

--Result #590--

-- 
which will have had more evidence
, 
may be able to
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  73
and maybe that's something the expert panel could be
asked about, there is in fact no realistic distinction
between the two.  It is simply my reading of the
evidence that I read was that there did seem to be the
distinctions I identified.  If that's not the view
that
 
is
 generally taken, then maybe that needs
considering.
What I would point out 
is that 
to set up
a
 compensation scheme to remedy injustice is
an
 exceptional measure requiring -- and what I'm
suggesting here is 
a
 significant broadening from what
would be legal liabilities and
,
 therefore
,
 
a
 judgment
has to be made whether there is 
a
 boundary around that
in terms of proportionality.  I sought to suggest
there might be 
a
 case where 
that
 
is
 so but clearly my
view is not determinative of that issue.

--Result #591--

Can I then pick up on vCJD.  If we go back to your
report
, 
please, at page 63.  You say there
, 
at
paragraph 4
.
89
, 
this:
"
A
 number of infected persons 
have
 received 
written warnings that there is 
a
 risk of there having 
contracted vCJD.  However
, 
the distress and suffering
 
caused by being informed of the risk of contracting 
this disease is not compensatable
 under the vCJD 
scheme
: 
this is 
a
 risk shared with all those who have 
 
74
received all relevant blood products
, 
whether or not 
they have been infected with the principal infections 
with which my terms of reference are concerned.  
Therefore
, 
I suggest that
, 
apart from the extent to 
which the 
general concern about the risk of vCJD 
applies to 
all infected persons otherwise eligible for 
compensation, this disease is left out of account in 
this scheme." 
Can I explore with you exactly what's meant
there?
Somebody who is not infected with hepatitis C,
not infected with HIV, not infected with hepatitis B,
but has -- has acquired no actual infection but has
been informed that they might be at risk of developing
vCJD, that category of person you asked not
recommended for inclusion within the compensation
scheme
.

--Result #592--

Well, 
I think so.  I think I start from the point
 --
and
,
 of course
,
 I may be completely wrong about this
 --
that the actual risks of contracting vCJD are very
small 
indeed
, but that's not to say
,
 of course
,
 
being
advised of the risk of it is not 
in 
itself 
a concerning
issue 
bearing in 
mind
 the gravity of CJD.
  But if we're
talking -- 
I'm not sure if you are suggesting that
I ought to consider those compensation schemes to
everyone who has received 
a
 blood transfusion because
there is that risk
, 
because 
that would seem to be -- 
if
you did ask me that I would suggest 
that
 
was
disproportionate.
But 
in relation to those who have one of the
eligible diseases
, 
and let's leave the issue about
hepatitis B out 
of that 
for 
a
 moment, then
 
I think
that the added information about vCJD could be taken
into account because whether you look at it as
an
 exacerbation of the suffering caused by the -- you
are actually looking at it as 
a
 relevant factor which
 
76
makes the distress of having 
a
 concatenation of the
infection greater
, 
and 
that
 
is
 part of 
a personal
circumstance
.
But I would treat that with some 
degree of
caution because
 -- 
again
, 
I 
could be
 completely wrong
,
people 
may 
have received warnings about that risk
, but
it strikes -- it would appear to me that that 
risk
must 
be extremely small 
indeed
.  
So 
objectively
,
whatever the distress has been caused, these people
are vanishingly unlikely to get that disease,
particularly now
.  
But 
I may be -- 
that could be
misinformation -- 
a
 misunderstanding on my part
.

--Result #593--

No.  And 
I would suggest that any assessment
s
 
of, as it
were, 
additional compensation to be paid for that does
need to take into account whether that advice ought to
be given and the terms in which it's been given.  If it
is correct advice
, of course, 
that's one thing, in
which case
, 
has everyone received that advice and if
not why not?  If it is wrong advice, then I wonder
whether 
that
 
is
 something that's so specific that it
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  77
shouldn't be talked about in the scheme.  It is
a
 complication
, 
it seems to me
, 
which probably requires
more information than I have access to
.

--Result #594--

So if we go to page 70.  The point emerges because of
what looked like 
a
 difference in wording between
paragraphs 2.15 and 
6.13
.  That's 
the reason 
why I was
asked to raise it with you
, 
Sir Robert.
Here you say:
"Entry to the compensation scheme should be made 
as easy as possible for all 
those
 infected persons 
who 
have been accepted as eligible for support by one of 
the existing or past support schemes."
 

--Result #595--

Then in the penultimate bullet point on the page, you
have referred there to
: 
"[
A
]
 defined period 
... 
during which the
administration of the infected blood or blood products
was avoidable
, whether 
in 
the 
light of the 
knowledge
 
84
of the time or retrospectively, subject to the
relevant technology or science 
being
 available at the
time."
Then you say this:
"It is difficult to identify such 
a
 strong moral 
case for compensation for treatments received before, 
for
 
example
, HCV or HIV were known to exist." 
Firstly, the reference to HCV would presumably
include, would it, previous descriptors such as 
non-A,
non-B
 hepatitis or 
non-B hepatitis or --

--Result #596--

Certainly not.  I mean, the fact they cleared obviously
is good news but it is realistically likely to lead to
a
 smaller sum by way of compensation than someone who
has 
a
 lifetime of suffering
.

--Result #597--

So 
the way in which you would envisage their
circumstances 
being
 catered for is they are within the
scheme but obviously in terms of the applicable tariff
and the kind of compensation that might be payable, it
may be significantly different from those who have had
a
 lifetime of treatment
?

--Result #598--

Then two further points arising out of that.  If
a
 child was infected before turning 18 but that
infection was not detected or symptoms did not develop
until after 18, would parents be eligible for
compensation in this category?
 
100

--Result #599--

That
 
is
 
a
 question of proof and evidence.  All I can
possibly say, bearing in 
mind
 what I just said about
the reason for parents and children 
being
 in this
category, is 
that 
it would seem to me the later in
childhood all this happened, particularly i
f during
childhood there was no evident infection or issue, then
we might not be looking very much by way of
compensation should they actually be eligible for it
.

--Result #600--

But then there would need to be 
a
 
judgement
 as to
whether additional compensation was warranted to
reflect what they had lost as an 
a
ffected --

--Result #601--

It has been pointed out to me, not least because of
the fact that so
 many
 years have passed
, 
in many
instances
, 
since
 
an
 individual's case, that that may
be all sorts of practical complications.  There may be
cases where there was no grant of probate, there may
be difficulties 
in 
unravelling who would be the right
individuals to bring claims.  I'm not going to list
all the various different permutations that have been
drawn to my attention
.
But I'm asked to explore this with you, in fatal
accidents at litigation, there would be one claim
 
110
brought on behalf of the estate identifying the
potential beneficiaries.  Would you agree that that
should in principle be the same for claims under the
compensation scheme
?

--Result #602--

That should be the position.  It is 
a
 difficult
 -- 
not
an
 area free from controversy, but -- because if the
compensation 
being
 received by the estate is for the
injury to the deceased person, it might be argued there
is no 
particular
 reason why that money 
should
 not be
subject to inheritance tax, whereas money 
that
 
is
received 
under, 
as it were under
, 
the Fatal Accidents
provision, the 
dependency clearly wouldn't I think be
under the Fatal Accidents Act, so 
shouldn't be in this
sort of claim
.
But 
I think there is 
a
 potential issue around
inheritance tax for, as it were, the compensation for
the suffering the deceased has gone through
, 
because
if 
a
 living 
deceased -- sorry, a living victim
receives compensation for their injury 
as a when -- 
if
they were to die the following day, that money would
be the subject of inheritance tax if it was of
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  113
a
 sufficient quantity.  
So 
there needs to be parity
there somewhere
.

--Result #603--

There was one other qualification.  Obviously in
relation to your deceased person, one of the
complications could well be some people will have
provided for 
an
 inheritance in 
a
 will, others will not
,
and they will be 
intestate
 and there could be all sorts
of potential complications coming out of those
approaches because
, 
as has been pointed out, 
a person
 
116
who 
has 
made 
a
 will without 
any expectation of
compensation may have made and
 entirely different
provision 
to what they would have done if
 they had.
I'm afraid the law has 
means
 of sorting that
out.  
None of that is simple and 
I do not think there
is anything I could do to make things less
complicated
.

--Result #604--

Well
,
 again, there's almost certainly
, 
in this
exercise
, 
got to be some front loading.  
Because, 
as
you say
, 
there will be
 -- 
the bulk people who think
they 
have a claim already 
know they 
think they 
have the
claim
, 
and they will be waiting there anxiously from
day one to put their claim in.
Obviously the efficacy of the scheme will 
depend
on whether sufficient funding is put in and resource
put in to enable 
a
 sufficient panel of assessors to be
recruited
, 
and I do envisage, I would envisage
, 
that
,
sensibly
, 
at the start
 
it may be slower dealing with
an
 individual case
 
than it becomes later on when it is
more used to you.
But 
I do point to the fact that it is not
impossible.  The 9/11 scheme dealt with all 3,000,
4,000 claims in two years, beginning to end.  I admit
that some of that might have been
 a stretch, 
sadly
,
more simple
, 
because they weren't talking about
lengthy 
and
 varying medical conditions in 
a
 way that
 
126
these assessors would
, 
but I'm rather 
assuming, 
I hope
rightly
, 
that once the understanding of the range of
medical experience is described
, that 
it should become
quite easier for 
actually 
the individuals themselves
to seek to fit themselves into categories and 
for 
the
information they produce
 
to be designed to that end
and assistance to be devised so that the information
can be processed relatively quickly
.  
But
 -- 
depending
on the nature of the case.
A
 lot will 
depend
 upon collaboration, the
willingness of people perhaps to accept something 
that
is
 a little bit more broad brush
 
than they 
would
 do in
a
 court
-
based system.  
But I would be confident
that -- I mean, 
obviously there has to be
a
 prioritisation of cases
, 
and you either take first
come
, 
first served
, 
which is probably the fair thing
to do
, 
or you look at urgent need, you might want to
do that, but I have assumed
 -- 
I would assume that my
recommendation about 
an
 interim payment has been made,
which would 
relieve 
the pressure
, 
and if you don't
have 
an
 interim payment of sufficient substance
, 
and
the figure I put in is clearly just 
a
 potential
figure
, 
but of sufficient substance to allay people's
fears that they might not actually be getting 
a
 fair
compensation
, 
then I would see it as 
a
 problem.  But
 
127
if that's provided then the pressure is a little bit
off in terms of how long things take
.

--Result #605--

Yes, I will do my best.  The idea of -- I can deal with
the exemplary damages first, 
is 
it is 
a
 punitive award.
So it is 
an
 award in 
a
 court system of the court's
disapproval of the conduct, usually of 
a
 state body but
it may be others
, 
and the misconduct as opposed to
a
 value of the injury that's 
being
 suffered.  So it is
a
 
bit
 like 
a
 fine but it is one that goes to the
claimant.
There are other jurisdictions where exemplary
damages are awarded by juries in the US in millions of
dollars 
a
 lot of the time
.  
It is 
a
 much less common
feature
 of claims in this country.  The Republic of
Ireland compensation scheme
, 
from memory
, 
allows for
 
131
exemplary damages and 
indeed
 has 
a
 special fund for
that.
I didn't feel qualified 
on 
what I knew to say
yay
 or 
nay 
to exemplary damages.  
All I would say
about it is that it would undoubtedly introduce an
adversarial element
 to what 
would otherwise 
I hope be
a
 more consensual collaborative scheme
, 
and 
a
 way of
dealing with exemplary damages 
would be 
to say
,
 well
,
if that's what you want try your luck in court because
it is not compensation in reality, it is 
a
 punitive
element
.
Aggravated damages, on the other hand, to my
mind
 could play 
a
 part
, 
which is where the injury has
been aggravated by conduct or something else that's
unacceptable
.  
And in the case here
, 
it seemed to me
from what I was hearing and what I read 
that 
one of
the things that 
a number of people -- 
many people are
complaining
 about has been 
an
 interference with in
effect their human rights.  Interference with family
life, 
interference 
with their autonomy in terms of
consent and other ways
, which 
they would say has been
completely wrong
, 
and 
that
 
has
 aggravated in 
a
 real
sense that the injury they have suffered and in some
cases in itself caused serious psychological distress
and sometimes mental illness
, and it was
 for that
 
132
reason I thought that that was something that could be
reflected actually in the autonomy award.  That's
really the purpose of having something over and above
the social impact award which was about the direct
effect of stigma and other things which exists
regardless 
actually 
of the conduct of this type.
These are concepts which are quite difficult to be
expressed but I think much easier to understand when
looking at the stories that I heard and are available
to the Inquiry
.

--Result #606--

It is
, and it 
also fits
,
 in my view
,
 rather uneasily
into 
a
 scheme which is meant to be about compensation
and 
a
 scheme which is meant to take the place of --
because it is broader than in some way
s
 litigation
.
  So
in one sense you might say that the need for exemplary
damages is at least reduced whatever the find
ings
 of
the Inquiry by the fact that there is this scheme in
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  133
existence to remedy what has gone before.  That would
be one thing
.  
But I think it fits -- it is quite 
a
 difficult
thing to fit into 
a
 collaborative scheme where you
have got assessors looking at medical history and all
the re
st 
of it and then suddenly having to 
switch into
decid
ing
 on what degree of culpability is involved and
what any individuals 
had 
happen
 
to them is so bad that
the state should be punished by 
giving
 extra money to
this 
particular
 individual as opposed to 
all the
 other
victims of this 
particular
 disaster.  That's my
problem
.

--Result #607--

Would it be right to understand, drawing on your
broader experience of how compensation is assessed
more widely, it may not be easy to describe those
categories but it ought to be possible to do so
?

--Result #608--

I come back to that, there is 
a
 choice to be made here.
In the court situation, in litigation, until
a
 provisional award of damages became possible it was
always the case that the court had to make
a
 once
-
and
-
for
-
all assessment at the point of the case
about 
an
 injury
, 
including the prognosis for the
future.  So damages would be awarded for in effect
the risks of deteriorations in the future
, 
which
, you
know, 
a
 degree of those risks would obviously 
depend
 on
the medical evidence.
So 
by definition, a one
-
off payment is never
right because
,
 firstly
,
 if it is 
a
 lump sum there is
an
 issue about how long people live and so no one
lives precisely to their statistical expectancy and
,
secondly
,
 some people will develop the risk and some
won't, so some people will be over-compensated but
some will be under compensated.  The advantage you get
in return
,
 though
,
 for that uncertainty and
broad
-
brush approach is you have finality and you know
where you are
, 
and you don't have to keep on
revisiting these things.  The strong message I was
getting from people is that 
a
 lot of them want that
finality.
The choice of having 
a
 provisional 
award
 
is
that -- 
which exists in the court system now is you
 
147
can
 have 
an
 award which assumes the best in effect and
then defines certain deteriorations which would allow
you to come back for more.  Of course
, 
a
 compensation
scheme could do that.  The reason I have not suggested
it but
,
 of course
,
 it could be done if you have
a
 powerful enough view about it is that it adds
complexity, it adds costs, it means that 
the
individuals can never let go of the system because
they will always be thinking
, "
We might need to go
back for more
"
, so they
've
 got to retain records
,
they've got to 
retain the ability to make good their
case, however collaborative the system is
.  
And then you ask the question how often can they
come back?  Do you have 
a
 series of provisional
awards
?  Now, again, the 
Republic of Ireland system
does allow
, I think, for 
awards of that nature.
I think 
the figures are available in their reports as
to how often that happens.  
I think it is 
a
 minority
of cases.  But you could do that.
The life expectancy issue is taken away in
relation to anything you award 
a
 periodical payment
award.  So you can now precisely compensate someone
for the length of their life because that's what
a
 periodical payment does.  But there is 
a
 choice to
be made
, 
and to put provisional 
damages as -- sorry,
 
148
provisional 
compensation in as 
a
 thing would mean that
people remained 
a
 member of 
a
 scheme which actually
they prefer not to be.  I mean
, 
people like the
support payments because they carry on getting them,
they don't have to do anything more about it
, 
and
I thought that's what would attract people
.  
But
,
 of
course
,
 you could have that option in there if you
wanted
.  
It would be 
a
 burden on the scheme.  It
would
,
 therefore
,
 cost the scheme more money and the
issue is whether it would deliver more by way of
justice to people and that's open to debate.  But
that's my reason for it anyway.

--Result #609--

Can I then
, 
if we go to the bottom of the page, just
pick it up with the care award.  So, again, this is
an
 element of the award that could be claimed by
an
 infected person.
If we go over the page top of the next page.
Page 110
, 
please.  You identify in paragraph 9.62 that
the need an
 incidence
 of the care required may be very
variable.  So this isn't a
 
one
-
size
-
fits
-
all type of
award
, 
some people might have had very extensive
needs
, some might have had comparatively 
limited needs
for care.
Then you have set out below how the court would
 
160
approach 
a
 damages claim.  I just wanted to pick it up
at the bottom of that page
, 
9.65
, 
read that and 
read
over the 
page
 
and then 
I'll 
ask you 
perhaps if you
could explain a little more 
of 
what's set out here and
why you make the recommendations you do.
So 
you have said here:
"In deciding how to approach the issue of 
compensation for care given, it is relevant to note 
the complexity involved in 
calculating
 such 
an
 award 
in court proceedings.  As 
an
 examination of the AA 
case will show, it is common practice for care 
experts, often qualified nurses or occupational 
therapists who run care agencies
, 
to be instructed to 
interview the injured person and their family and to 
obtain highly detailed accounts of the history of 
their needs 
over
 
time
.  They will then analyse that 
evidence, which can be extraordinarily detailed, to 
identify separate periods of differing need.  
Sometimes they will go into minute detail
, for example 
considering
 
the month following a spell in hospital, 
or a period when the injured 
was away at school.  
Then, in respect of each such period
, 
the expert will 
calculate the type of care required 
(
eg nursing, 
gardening, DIY
), 
the number of hours
, 
and the 
appropriate commercial rate.  The rate may differ 
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  161
according to whether the care is daytime or night 
care, itself divided into 
'
sleeping
'
 or 
'
non-sleeping
'
 
care
, 
or for 
'
unsocial
'
 hours such as when care is 
required at weekends or public holidays
.  The exercise 
is then repeated for the predicted future needs of the 
insured person." 
Just pausing there.  In 
a
 large personal injury
claim in court, is it right to understand there would
be potentially rival care experts
, 
each performing the
task that you
've
 described here, huge
ly long
 reports,
schedules, itemising every aspect of care and seeking
to quantify it
, 
and then the expert on the other side
tries to chisel away at that and suggests
, "
You don't
need that number of hours
", 
and
, "You don't need that
degree of qualification", and so on?

--Result #610--

Absolutely
.  
And 
one 
the reason
s
 
for that, putting it
bluntly, is that often in catastrophic injury cases 
the
claim for care is the biggest item of the claim
, 
and
I can envisage cases in this field where that could be
the case.  But you are right, it has always been
a
 surprise to me that after many years of practice we
still have experts giving evidence to the claimant,
another one giving expert evidence for the defence,
both looking at the same set of facts, one would have
thought
, 
and both coming up with radically different
 
162
figures on absolutely every aspect
: 
how many hours
there should b
e, 
what the rate should be, what grade of
nurse is required and so on.
Having undertaken that exercise
, 
and this is
perhaps the cynical lawyer coming in, you would be
surprised 
at 
how often the figures come out rather the
same in every case because the judges take 
a
 view
, 
as
they have to when expert evidence is provided
, 
and
a
 great deal of resource is undertaken and I think
often at some distress to the families I have
represented because the intrusion into their lives by
two experts poking around
, 
putting it bluntly
, 
into
every aspect of what they do and why and when can be
in itself distressing when
, 
as I have suggested here
,
I think for 
a
 scheme like this it ought to be
possible, again with the exception -- I know I'm
loading 
a
 lot on the medical panel here -- but may be
extended to this purpose -- the care need of people
with 
a
 
particular
 condition should be capable of
a
 fairly standardised approach
, I would say, 
even if
that means people don't get such 
a
 detailed assessment
but it might not be quite as much
 -- 
some people might
get more than they would expect but it is 
an
 area
classically 
which 
shows why we need 
a
 compensation
payment scheme which has 
a slightly -- has
 
163
a
 broad
-
brush approach 
to the thing 
rather than
a
 detailed 
bespoke 
assessment 
for each individual.

--Result #611--

If we just look at what you say in 9.66 and 9.67
: 
"
It is suggested that to conduct such
an
 exercise in the case of each applicant infected
 
164
under 
a
 compensation scheme would defeat the ambition
of most to have 
a
 scheme which is simple to
understand
, 
and prompt in its determinations
.  It is
necessary to devise a method of offering a fair, if
broad brush, reflection in 
any award 
of 
the need for
care generally experienced by the infected 
both 
in the
past and present.  
An
 option 
could
 be made available
enabling 
an
 applicant 
to choose
 
between accepting the
broad brush sum, or undertaking a more detailed
application as would take place in 
a
 civil action.
Alternatively
, 
it may be felt that 
settling a maximum
applying to all within the scheme - except for the
truly exceptionally severe cases - 
would promote
equity/parity among the infected in this scheme.
"
9.67 
Whatever approach is taken, this is 
an
 area where the advantages of avoiding 
a
 demanding 
process involving detailed evidence and expert support 
suggest
 
that 
a
 high degree of self assessment should 
be encouraged
, 
but limited by reference to expert
 
based standardised presumptions with regard to care 
needs and costs." 

--Result #612--

Well, what I'm suggesting is that the support payments
,
with some adjustments
, 
would continue as they are at
the moment
, 
as 
support
 payments
, 
and they would be
guaranteed for the lifetime of the applicant.
I do that because there was 
a
 very strong
representation to me that people did not want to lose
that security 
and certainty.  So
 I could have said
,
and I obviously thought about saying
: 
stop the
 
support
payment, everyone is now going to get compensation
which would 
cover
 the sorts of things that the 
support
 

11 July 2022
          
          

  169
payment might be expected
 
to 
cover
, remembering that
of all the -- 
there are
 -- 
various reasons 
have been
given 
for
 them
, and part one of them is about 
lifting
people out of poverty and presumably 
an
 element of
care
, 
but there is this general payment there
.
It was 
a
 principle of mine
, 
which I think was
called for
 as well
, clearly people 
do not want
support -- sorry, 
the compensation scheme to leave
them in 
a
 worse position than they were before.  So it
seemed to me that 
a 
starting point had to be 
that 
we
carr
ied
 on with the support payments 
as they were
made.  
However, 
it did seem to me that whatever 
might
be 
the position about taking account of the support
payments 
that remained in the past
 
that 
the other side
of the coin, to carry them on in perpetuity 
for
 the
future 
would be 
that 
they 
should be tak
en
 
ac
count of
against any 
claim for 
financial loss -- 
future
financial loss
, 
and it might well be that in 
a
 lot of
cases that would mean there would be no further claim,
although 
the case 
Sir Brian was talking about where
there was 
a
 need for 
a
 care home or permanent care
that might 
well 
not be the case, there might be
significant sums in 
excess
 
of 
that.
So basically 
there 
would be 
a
 continu
ation
 
with
a base line of this is to cover the 
financial losses
 
170
in the future, not I should say to be taken away
from -- it wouldn't be taken off against 
a
 personal
injury claim
, 
as it were, the impact loss, but would
be taken account of in that way.
And 
as far as the past 
was
 concerned, for
reasons I have set out here, it seemed to me it would
be wrong to seek to take credit for payment -- support
payments that have been made in the past whether it
would be under
 -- since 
2017 or the rather more
sporadic payments 
made before then
.

If we can go over the page, we see here set out

you're looking here at documents 
that 
would have passed

on the issues that were being set out here in terms of
repercussions and how you weighed those matters?

Then the fourth item, item D, appended to Mr Canavan's
minute of 6 November we will look at briefly.
It's DHSC0046962_187.
This is an update on the present position on the
HIV
 
Haemophilia Litigation
.  
Under the heading "Court
Proceedings
" -- 
I don't need to read through it but it's
a summary of the position relating to the proceedings.
There's then an account of the position regarding public
interest immunity which had pre
-
dated your time as
 
46
Secretary of State.
Then we see the heading "Parliamentary Activity":
"Over the past year there have been 
three
adjournment debates on the question of compensation for
haemophiliacs with HIV
.  
The Hansard 
account 
of the most
recent debated on 15
 
October is annexed
.  
In addition
,
the Haemophilia Society has organised a write-in
campaign to increase pressure for an out of court
settlement of the litigation.
"
It is possible that the Opposition will seek to
increase the pressure by initiating a Supply debate on
the matter shortly 
after 
the start of the new
Parliamentary Session."
Pausing there, is it right to understand that
the -- again
, 
as part of the context in which you were
operating, there was the campaign through the
Haemophilia Society and 
indeed
 through various
newspapers, but there was also intense Parliamentary
interest by this point in time on this issue?

--Result #615--

Or otherwise Harriet Harman.  A no-fault compensation
bill.
There's then a description of the intervention of
Mr Justice Ognall.  I'm not going to read through 
that
.
If we just go towards the bottom of the page, we
can see this brings matters really up to date prior to
the day before you took office
.  
It refers to
Kenneth Clarke meeting counsel on 1
 
November
:
"
The 
line 
was 
confirmed that 
there
 should be 
no
offer from the 
Department.  However, our Counsel would
make 
known to the Plaintiffs that if they were to 
offer
a settlement around £20 to £25 million plus 
cost
s this
might be considered."
Then there's a reference to 
no
 money having been
agreed with the 
Treasury
.
Then if we go to the next page
:
"
Counsel's Opinion on Legal Defence
"The latest opinion from Counsel 
given

is that the Government defendants should be able to
defeat the plaintiffs' claims.  However
 
they caution

that although the advice that you were being given was
that it was likely the defendants would succeed in the
claim

it was by

Then if we look at HSOC0012332, this is a letter dated
2
 
November 1990 from Mrs 
Thatcher
 to Alf Morris
 
MP.
It's the date upon which you were appointed Secretary of
State
, 
so highly unlikely, I think, that you would have
seen it before it went out
.  
The Inquiry has looked at this letter before
, 
so
I just want to go to the last paragraph on the second
page
.  
Mrs 
Thatcher, 
having set out various observations
about no-fault compensation
, then 
says:
"I
 am sorry 
if this is a disappointing 
reply but
t
he Government is showing its great concern for
 
54
hemophiliacs
 
with HIV, by the 
ex
-
gratia payments it is
making.  The question of compensation has to remain
a matter for the Courts to decide."
Then if we turn to a 
Departmental 
comment on that
letter, it's at DHSC0020866_100.  It's a minute dated
9
 
November 1990 from a 
Ms
 Stewart to Mr Kendall, not
a document copied to your 
private office
, but it says
this
:
"
... 
I see from today's Independent that the
Prime Minister has written to Alf Morris saying that any
compensation is a matter which must be settled in the
courts
.  
Thus
, 
it is speculated
, 
pre-empting any choice
Mr Waldegrave might have had in the matter."
Do you have any observation on that last sentence?

--Result #617--

Then if we can just look at your response to this
letter, there's one point I wanted to explore with you,
DHSC0004365_032.  It's the response of 26 November 1990
.
We can see
, 
if we go over the page, it's from you
.  
Then
if we go back to the previous page and the text of the
letter, third paragraph.  You say this:
"
But 
perhaps in turn I might make the Government's
position clear.  Those taking legal action are of course
entirely free to do so
, 
if they believe they are
entitled to compensation on grounds of negligence.  
But
it
 is their own choice.  The Government has not
encouraged them to take such action.  Indeed, by
providing financial help totalling £34 million for HIV
infected 
haemophiliacs and their families, with an
undertaking to keep the sum available under review,
we
 
have shown that it's not necessary to take legal
action to secure financial help."
Now, I am not going to ask you about the previous
two payments which had totalled the 34 million and what
 
59
had prompted those.  Those pre
-
date your time in office.
But in terms of the suggestion
 "
not necessary to take
legal action to secure financial help
", 
would it be
right to say that 
the
 action that you then took, which
secured the funding
, 
as we'll see shortly, to settle
the
 
litigation, and provide further financial assistance
to those infected, really was only forthcoming because
of the litigation, was it not?

--Result #618--

But you think issues such as the risk of setting
precedence and the risk of no-fault compensation would
have been discussed, those having been matters been
flagged up by the 
treasury
 officials
?

--Result #619--

And then we see Mr Mellor in paragraph 4 saying:
"
... 
it now appears that the other
, 
much smaller
costs 
- 
particularly in the case of the territorial
departments - are likely to fall in the next financial
year.  I can see little reason why such relatively minor
costs cannot be met from within next year's existing
provision, particularly since you have advance notice.
You are aware of the difficulties we have 
had
 to face on
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  109
public expenditure this year: it is already clear that
next year will be 
no
 easier.  I must therefore ask all
three departments to absorb these costs."
So in this letter Mr Mellor is saying 
no
 to any
additional provision 
from
 the Reserve for these
additional costs identified.
Can we then just pick up your letter in response
at DHSC0003660_007.
This is you on 25
 
March 1991 back to Mr Mellor.
If we just go a little further down, so we can see
the text
.  
So in point 2, you express concern at the
line Mr Mellor was taking about meeting legal costs.
You set 
out 
your understanding as 
according
 with that of
Mr Lang
: 
"... 
namely that compensation costs and reasonable
legal expenses for the plaintiffs would be made
available from the Reserve.
"
And in the last sentence of that paragraph you
say:
"I must thus ask you to maintain your earlier
agreement to meet legal expenses from the Reserve."
You then say, in paragraph 4:
"As your officials have been told, it is now
improbable that payments will be made in this financial
year as the legal 
process
 has not been complete
d
.
 
110
Therefore
 
the £42 million can be surrendered this year
but will be 
required
 from the Reserve in 1991-92.
I trust you can agree to this."
Now
, 
is this right
, 
Lord Waldegrave
, 
that when
you'd had your original discussions with Mr Mellor back
in December of 1990, it had been envisaged that it was
likely, although not, I think, guaranteed, that the
further discussions that were necessary to iron out the
full details of the settlement terms and secure
agreement of individuals, the hope was that would be
completed within the financial year, so that the
reserves that you were utilising would result in payment
out before the end of the financial year?

--Result #620--

Then I think we can probably therefore take the
remaining documents I hope fairly quickly.  You'd
received a letter from Ian Lang in January 1991
.  
It's at
 D
HS
C
0003660_009.
So dated 17
 
January, paragraph 1 refers to the
announcement on 11
 
December, and the second part of that
paragraph sets out Mr Lang's understanding that 
the
£
4
2 million is intended to cover the United Kingdom.
Mr Lang then says in the second paragraph:
"
... 
there are separate Scottish legal actions for
compensation but these 
had 
not progressed as far as the
English claims.  The Scottish lawyers concerned were not
represented on the steering committee and have not been
party to the preparation of the proposals nor involved
in the discussions which have taken place with the
Steering Committee.  This has placed the Scottish Office
in a difficult position since all the discussions on the
details of the settlement have been in relation to the
 
140
English plaintiffs, and there have already been
representations made to me by the Scottish lawyers that
they were not consulted before the offer was made
public.  They consider that they are not in a position
to advise their clients on acceptance or otherwise until
they know and can access the contents of the offer and
conditions of acceptance but also until they have fully
investigated their clients' claims.  It has not been
possible as yet to let them have sight
 
of the heads of
agreement since this has still to be 
finalised 
for the
English litigants, and will
, 
because 
it is drafted in
the context of English litigation, and in effect is
a response to an initial approach by the English
Steering Group, 
require
 
thereafter to be revised in
order to convey the offer properly for Scotland.  My
officials have been liaising with yours and it is hoped
to let the Scottish lawyers have a Scottish draft soon."
Then there is a suggestion that because of the
need to -- if we could just go over the page
 -- 
the
Scottish lawyers to assess the acceptability of the
proposals
, 
there needs to be an investigation of the
claims.
"
This 
would
 take some time 
and would
 conflict with
the 
shorter 
timetable which I understand is being
proposed for acceptance of the offer by English
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  141
plaintiffs.  Clearly we would wish to move in step with
you and other parts of the United Kingdom in making 
the
offer formally, but 
if a common date for acceptance is
imposed there is a risk that the Government will be
criticised by the legal profession and the public in
Scotland for attempting to steamroller the settlement
without giving an opportunity for adequate
investigations
 of the 
value of the 
claims by 
the 
legal
representatives of claimants and the consequent wisdom
of acceptance of the offer
 -- 
opportunities which 
[
were
]
given to claimants in England."
Then there is a request for a degree of
flexibility for the particular Scottish position
.
Before I ask you a question, if we can then look
at your response --

--Result #621--

Yes
, so just picking up then
, 
in the contemporaneous
 
148
documentation
, 
to start with
, 
DHSC0003657_119.
Now
, 
this
 
is a letter from a firm of solicitors in
Scotland.  It's date 18
 
December 1990.  It's addressed
to you and it's copied to, amongst others,
the
 
Prime Minister and to Robin Cook MP.  It says:
"Dear Minister 
...
"
I act for a number of people passed to me by the
Law Society of Scotland and from medical specialists and
my task is to attempt to obtain compensation for them as
a result of their having developed AIDS as a result of
whole blood transfusions which were HIV infected.
"I am
 sure that you will be aware of the
correspondence and submissions to your predecessor in
office and questions asked in Parliament by a number of
Members irrespective of political affiliation.
"
I have a copy of the detailed response made by
your predecessor to those questions but I still have not
had a rational or adequate explanation of how the
situation of people such as my clients can be
distinguished from that of the unfortunate haemophiliacs
who are also sadly 
afflicted
."
Then the next paragraph refers to the likelihood
of legal action, and then picking it up in the bottom of
the page:
"The only adequate and reasonable solution is
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  149
a settlement such as has been offered to the
haemophiliacs who are unfortunately also infected.  The
numbers of people infected through whole blood
transfusions is impossible to predict
 
but in my
experience in Scotland
 
despite efforts to ask them to
come forward, we have knowledge at present of very few.
Those I know of are in single figures.  Even 
if
a settlement
, 
however
, 
were to provoke many more claims,
surely it is only decent and honourable to meet those
claims.  Equally, from any objective point of view it
must be more sensible rather than expend money on
lawyers such as me through the Legal Aid Fund to
compensate the unfortunate victims, especially bearing
in mind that a number of them are very young people.
Indeed one of my clients is a 
five year
 old boy and
another an 
eighteen year
 old girl."
Then we see reference to the letter being copied
to the Prime Minister himself
:
"... 
because of the vital and desperate nature of
the situation faced by my clients."
Now
, 
I don't know whether this is a letter that
would have made its way to you.  I don't think the
documentation provides an answer to that.  I'll double
check.

And 
then
 we can see the same issue being picked up now
by an MP in January of 1991, so about three weeks later
,
at DHSC0042272_145.
This is from John Marshall
, 
who 
was, 
I think we've
seen from other material
, 
a passionate advocate on this
issue
.  8
 
January
 
1991
.  It's addressed to
a Sydney Chapman MP, but he tells us at the bottom of
the letter that he's sending you a copy of it.
So it refers to the Rosie Barnes Bill
 -- 
and
that's the 
no
-
fault compensation Bill that we 
saw
referred to earlier

--Result #623--

So if we look at the attached brief and line to
 
take
,
it's at DHSC0042272_143.  If we just 
zoom
 in.  The
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  153
"
Background
"
:
"The figures relating to HIV/AIDS infection in UK
through blood transfusion are as follows:
"
reported cases infected with HIV 
... 
131
(
breakdown of place of transfusion not available)
"
reported cases 
with
 AIDS (as at November 1990)
...
"
Then there's a breakdown as 
between 
cases of
transfusion in the UK and cases abroad.
And 
2:
"The previous two 
awards to 
haemophiliacs
, 
in 1987
and 1989
, 
have been following by campaigns to give
similar financial help to those who have 
con
tracted
HIV/AIDS as a result of blood transfusions.
"3.  
The payments to haemophiliacs have recognised
the
ir
 wholly exceptional circumstances, whereby they
were doubly disadvantage
d 
by their pre-existing
haemophilia as well the 
HIV 
infection.
"4.  
We have accepted from the outset the need to
'
ring
 
fence
'
 haemophiliacs because of their special
circumstances.  People infected with HIV as a
 
result of
blood transfusion/transplants are 
no
 different in
principle from other groups of patients harmed as an
unfortunate side result of NHS treatment.  
For
 
example
,
there are cases which fall into the category of those
 
154
who acquired HIV through skin 
grafts 
or organ
transplants.
"5.  
Any special treatment for HIV infect blood
transfusion recipients would 
repercuss 
by exciting
expectations which would be difficult to contain in
other groups of patients harmed as an unintended
byproduct of NHS treatment.  The direct cost of
conceding 
for 
UK transfused cases with AIDS would
be
 
around £1 million and if all HIV cases are included
the cost could be around £5 million.  The more
exceptions 
that 
are made, the closer we move to
'
no fault compensation
' 
without discussing the
rationale
, 
and the
 
greater the number of claims that
would result from those 
who feel 
that they 
too
 are
deserving
.
"
And so
 
against that background
, 
the 
"
Line to take
"
that you were given
:
"
Payments for haemophiliacs recognise their unique
combination of circumstances
.  
These do not 
apply 
to
blood transfusion recipients."
So would it be fair to understand the departmental
line at this point in time is to hold
, 
or try to hold
the ring-fence and not extend the financial provision
any further?

--Result #624--

If we pick it up in the second paragraph, he says 
this
:
"The recent settlement with haemophiliacs who are
HIV positive has again raised awareness among this group
of the injustice of their position.  Frankly I find it
wholly untenable to accept that the NHS has
a responsibility to provide financial compensation to
one group who are HIV positive as a result of NHS
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  157
treatment whilst denying the same response to another
group of NHS patients who are also HIV positive as
a
 
result of NHS treatment.  I could understand, although
not accept, this distinction
, 
if the group to whom
liability was being denied was the larger group with
a larger cost
, 
but the continued refusal to accept
responsibility in this case is all the more difficult to
comprehend as the numbers involved are so few and the
cost of settlement would be so much less than the amount
already provided for the greater number of
haemophiliacs."

--Result #625--

Then he says:
"I do appreciate that it is important for the NHS
,
and 
no
 doubt the 
Treasury
, 
that a clear ring-fence is
drawn around any compensation made in order to avoid
a precedent for wider claims from other NHS patients
.
However
 
it does seem to me wholly untenable to try to
erect a 
ring fence
 around one group of HIV positive
patients, whilst leaving another group outside.  It
would surely be much more easy to defend a 
ring fence
which accepted that this precedent applied only to those
patients who became HIV positive as a result of
 
158
treatment with infected blood or blood products and did
not apply in any 
wider
 medical circumstances.
"These are the points which I have urged at
intervals over the past 
three
 years.  I hope though that
now 
there 
is obviously a greater willingness to resolve
this matter
 
it will be possible for you to take a fresh
look at the claim of this small group and put them on
a par with the settlement to haemophiliacs."
Leaving 
aside 
the point which you said you didn't
much like, is there anything else in Robin Cook's letter
that you would disagree with
?

--Result #626--

Yes
.  We 
may pick that up when we look at the document.
We can see the note in question is at
DHSC0003560_051.
So this from Mr Dobson
, 
dated 23
 
April 1991
.  
The
first paragraph refers to the fact that at the meeting
you'd asked for a note on the position.  And then
paragraph 2
, 
it said:
"
... 
the cost of a scheme limited to people with
HIV transfused in the UK would not be trivial
 --
probably some 
£
3
-
5m depending on assumptions
.  
But the
real difficulty over granting 
a concession would be to
re-establish a credible 
'
ring-fence
'
 to prevent any
further movement towards a general system of no fault
compensation.  The government has always justified its
special position for HIV
-
infected haemophiliacs on the
 
162
grounds that they are a uniquely unfortunate group
 - 
in
particular
, 
because the 
tragedy of infection with the
HIV virus was 
superimposed on a severe hereditary
disability.  In contrast, it is difficult to draw any
logical distinction between the HIV
-
infect
ed
 blood
transfusion cases and other victims of medical
accidents.  If ministers wish to reconsider the case for
some general system of no
-
fault compensation
 
that is
another matter
, 
but in my view, the worst of all
possible worlds would be to slide into no-fault
compensation through a series of reluctant concessions
to 
well
-
orchestrated campaigns.
"One final point is that 
Treasury
 would strongly
resist any further concession
, 
and might 
well
 accuse us
of bad faith in even considering it.  
(
The danger of
knock-on effects was raised with 
Treasury
 officials in
the discussions leading up to last December's
announcement, but the assumption was that a settlement
for the haemophiliacs could be ring-fenced.
)  
At 
a
 time
when the 
Treasury
 are trying to renege on their
agreement to fund haemophiliac settlement 
..."
That must be the spat we 
looked at
 earlier

Lord Waldegrave.

Then if we look over the page

I don't need to read
through the majority of the document.  So we can have

This is what is attached to Mr Dobson's minute

If we go 
to

 next page, the arguments against
compensation start towards the bottom of the page.  I am
not going to read through the detail because

Medical Officer, around the same time, DHSC0002862_006.
This 
is 
29 April 1991
, 
from Jane Verity to
Mr Dobson
, 
copied to Mr Alcock, so it would have come to
your office
:
"CMO has seen your minute of 23 April which
supplied Secretary of State with a note on the present
position on compensation for people infected with HIV
through blood transfusion, and on the cost that would be
incurred if we were to extend to them the compensation
 
168
scheme for haemophiliacs.
"
CMO has commented that he thinks the only tenable
argument of differentiation from haemophilia of any
weight is in paragraph 3 of Annex 
--Result #629--

Yes.  And then we can see in the first paragraph it
says:
"The settlement of 42 million for the
haemophiliacs has sparked off a campaign for
compensation for those that 
become
 infected with HIV
through blood transfusion.  Similar campaigns were
resisted following the announcement of the first payment
of £10 million for the haemophiliacs in 1987 and the
announcement of the payment of £20,000 each in 1989.  On
this occasion The
 '
Observer
'
 
has picked up the issue and
given it a higher profile.  So far the Department has
received only one writ from a blood transfusion
recipient but there are signs that legal actions are
being considered by 
many more."
Under the heading "Justification":
"We have always justified the special provision
for haemophiliacs on the grounds that they were doubly
 
171
disadvantaged; the problems of HIV were superimposed on
the health, social and financial disadvantages they
already suffered as a result of their hereditary
haemophilia.  This combination of circumstances would
not generally apply to blood transfusion cases.  (Those
suffering from hereditary
 
thalassemia or
 
sickle cell
anaemia who require blood transfusions may claim to be
doubly disadvantaged
 
but there are thought to be few
with HIV).  However, it is very difficult to get this
argument across to the public
 
who have considerable
sympathy for the blood transfusion cases.  Those
campaigning on their behalf stress the similarities with
the haemophiliacs
; 
both groups 
were infected through
treatment and those infected could pass the HIV to their
families."

--Result #630--

And if we go over the page there's a list of pros and
cons for extending compensation.  
Pros:
"
(i) 
Relieves the political and media pressure at
 
172
present on the Government
;
"(ii) 
Reduces the risk of another round of
embarrassing and costly litigation and criticism for
'
forcing
'
 people with a fatal infection to take this
course
;
"(iii) 
Numbers and costs involved are relatively
small 
(
see Annex
)
 if the concession can be ring
-fenced;
"(iv) 
Removes the risk that a thalassemia or
sickle cell case will be highlighted
 and undermine our
justification for 
exceptional help for haemophiliacs.
"(v) 
While not all countries have state
compensation schemes for HIV victims, most of those that
we know about cover both blood transfusion and
haemophiliac cases 
(
eg Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Australia, Canada
)
."
So 
I think it's right to say that those pros are
all
 
either
 related to financial costs or to reputational
issues in relation to the Government.  There is 
no
articulation there of a moral case
, 
is there?

--Result #631--

Although we know from the CMO that he suggested 
that
would be 
no
 more than ten.
"
3.
 
Outside the HIV field there is already 
public
pressure for compensation for those children who
received with human growth hormone and who now be at
risk of developing 
[
CJD
]
."
If we go to the next page, last sentence of that
paragraph:
"Moreover
, 
there
 is 
a risk that additional people
will 
acquire CJD through 
corneal and other transplants.
"
(iv) 
There are other diseases 
transmitted though
blood and blood products.  In particular 
most
haemophiliacs were infected with hepatitis before blood
 
174
products were heat
-
treated.  This is less serious than
HIV and although transmitted sexually
 
a vaccine against
hepatitis B offers protection to spouses.  Few
haemophiliacs
 ... 
will die as a result of hepatitis
.
However
, 
there are early moves to try to seek
compensation for 
these 
people.  
Those accepting the HIV
settlement are precluded from raising the hepatitis
issue 
as the arguments are so similar to HIV.  However,
there are several thousand haemophiliacs who will not
share in the settlement and who may 
feel
 that they have
lost out and press
 
the hepatitis case.
"
(v) There are 
many other examples of drug
reaction
 and medical treatments given in good faith
where
 non-negligent harm has occurred."
And an example given there in relation to
benzodiazepine.
"(vi) 
Ring
-fencing 
the numbers may be very
difficult as HIV spreads beyond the high risk groups;
anyone who received blood before 
1985 and contracts HIV
in the future may refer back to the earlier transfusion
and it
 is 
unlikely to be feasible to establish the
source of 
infection
 with certainty."
Then the next paragraph:
"
(vii) 
It would undermine the Government's stance
on no
 
fault compensation and make it difficult to resist
 
175
pressures for a 
review."
Then if we go over the page we can see it 
is 
said
that
:
"Further concessions could have 
repercussions for
other Departments.
"
Paragraph 6:
"
Treasury
 seems likely to resist any further
concession.  
They have always been concerned that the
payments to the haemophiliacs could have wider
repercussions and have been anxious that those
concessions 
should be ring-fenced.
"
7.
 
 
The concession to blood transfusion cases
might not remove the problem completely."
Then there is reference to the fact that there
would need to be a panel and the issue of patients
abroad.  Then 
8
 -- 
and indeed, sorry, I was wrong
earlier 
when
 I said the issue doesn't arise.  That same
point that we explored a few minutes ago,
Lord Waldegrave, is more shortly and succinctly
expressed 
here
.

--Result #632--

It's compressed.  There could be pressure on HIV testing
and counselling services and then there's a question as
to how it could raise fears generally about the safety
of the blood supply
.
 
176
Those are the pros and cons.  There's then
a section about options, which refers to, in
paragraph 10, 
it will:
"... 
exclude those transfused abroad 
... 
this is
defensible.
"
And it's said to be consistent with a scheme for
haemophiliacs which is limited to those treated in the
UK.  So that disposes of that concern.  Top of the next
page:
"A more credible ring-fence could be established
round all those infected with HIV 
through
 medical
treatment, as it would be very difficult to exclude
those few who have been infected with HIV with tissue or
organ transplant.  HIV is the emotive issue and the
public are unlikely to be convinced that it is
reasonable to compensate those who were infected by 
one
form of treatment but not another."
Then paragraph 12:
"If all those infect
ed
 with HIV through medical
treatment are to be compensate
d, 
in addition to
haemophiliacs
 
the justification for ring-fencing these
from all other victims of medical accident
s
 would be
that the HIV infection 
will
 be life
-
long and can be
transmitted to their spouses and children
.  
Apart from
using barrier methods of contraception
, 
there is 
no
 way
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  177
of preventing spread to their spouse
.  
These
considerations are not as true for people with other
injuries or infections."
Then there is a reference to no-fault
compensation, and it's suggested an alternative approach
could be a review of the case for a no-fault
compensation scheme.  I'm not going to 
read 
through
that.
If we go over the page, 
"
Conclusions
"
,
paragraph 15:
"The ring-fence round the haemophiliacs is
difficult to maintain.  Finding another place to
re-establish it is also difficult.  If there is to be
further movement then it might be possible to defend
a ring-fence around all HIV cases infected in the UK by
blood, organ and tissue donation undertaken as part of
medical treatment.  This further concession however
would send the wrong signals to other groups already
lining up to press their own case for compensation.
Re
-
opening the no-fault compensation issue would not
resolve the immediate problem and could be unattractive
on other grounds.  It comes down to a question of where
Ministers wish to take a stand against claims for
compensation."
Is it fair to read this
 as, 
in terms of the
 
178
perspective 
of departmental officials, not enthusia
stic
for a change in policy, but essentially saying
: 
it's
your job, ministers, if you want to change course?

--Result #633--

  
This then is 
a 
presentation on the role of the
Chief Medical Officer.  There is a written note on that
topic which has already been disclosed to Core
Participants and is published 
on 
our website.  
The
presentation today won't cover everything that's
contained in that written note.
Our focus for today 
will
 be on the Chief Medical
Officer's role in the response to AIDS over the 1980s.
 
2
That 
will
 involve considering in some detail the actions
taken by the two Chief Medical Officers for England
during that period, Sir Henry Yellowlees
, 
who held the
role until the end of 1983
, 
and 
Sir
 
Donald Acheson
, 
who
commenced in post in October 1983.  So there was
a 
three-month overlap between them.
As with other presentations, our intention is to
provide 
a 
neutral and factual narrative 
which 
brings
together relevant documents for your attention and for
the attention of Core Participants.
I should 
add
 that the written 
note 
itself is not
exhaustive either.  Core Participants and the Inquiry
team may well identify further documents relevant to the
role of the Chief Medical Officer as the Inquiry
progresses.
A 
road map then for today is to start with 
a 
brief
over
view of the role of Chief Medical Officer and its
responsibilities.  Then we will 
go
 on to 
a 
chronological
exploration of the documents touching on the Chief
Medical Officer's response to AIDS which 
will
 include
looking at the involvement of Sir Henry Yellowlees 
until
the end of his tenure at the end of 
1983 
and then
Sir Donald
 
Acheson's involvement after his point October
of that year, the introduction of antibody testing, the
public awareness campaign which 
Sir 
Donald Acheson was
 
3
heavily involved in and the introduction of heat
treatment for factor products and 
a 
brief look at some
documents on
 
Sir Donald Acheson's attitude to
compensation for those affected.
I will then come 
back at the 
end to make some
over
arching comments about two particular categories of
documents.  One is what's referred to as 
"
Dear Doctor
"
letters which were sent by the Chief Medical Officer to
the medical profession 
from
 
time
 
to
 
time
 and the second
category is the Chief Medical Officer's annual reports.
Starting then with the overview of the role, the
role of the Chief Medical Officer can be traced back to
the 
antecedent post of Medical Officer to the
General Board of Health
, 
which was established under the
General Board of Health Continuance Act in 1855.  By the
time frame relevant to this presentation in the 1980s
,
the role had at least threefold responsibilities
, 
which
were
: 
first
, 
providing advice to ministers; second,
providing public health information to the medical
profession and the wider public; and, third, providing
leadership to the medical officers who worked at the
Department for Health and Social Security, DHSS.
To look at the remit of the role, 
a 
helpful
description is contained in the BSE Inquiry report
published in the year 2000
, 
which is at MHRA0031996.
 
4
We can see this is volume 15 of that report which
dealt with Government and public administration.  
Could
we go
, 
please
,
 to page 36 of this volume and focus on
the second half of the page under the sub-heading
 "The
Chief Medical Officer 
(
CMO
)"
.
We can see at paragraph 4
.
17
, 
it's set out 
th
at
:
"
Although there were CMOs for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland
, 
advising their respective Ministers on
matters affecting those parts of the United Kingdom, the
responsibility for advising the UK Government on matters
affecting the United Kingdom as 
a 
whole fell to the CMO
for England
.
"
The
 written note do
es 
touch on the roles of the
CMOs for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland but today
we'll be focusing on 
the
 role of the CMO for England and
their interactions in relation to AIDS in the 1980s.
Going on then to paragraph 4
.
18, the dates are
given and then this quotation from
 
Sir Donald Acheson
,
who was in post
, 
as we've heard
, 
from 1983 until his
retirement in 1991
, 
the observation is set out that
:
"... '
the sheer scale and personal responsibility
of the post seemed 
to
 
have
 dimensions which distinguish
it
 even from some of the high
est
 posts of all within
Whitehall
'
.  
[And 
he
 
said
 
that
] 
Paper comes into the
CMO's office on 
a 
scale which normally applies to
 

7 July 2022
          
          

  9
and ministers, we've also heard from Dr Diana Walford
,
who was 
a 
Deputy Chief Medical Officer
, 
and she has
given evidence that in the context of those parallel
administrative and medical hierarchies in the DHSS,
the
 
CMO had access to ministers whenever 
he
 wished.  So
there was 
a 
bridge at the top of these hierarchies.
The next document we'll 
go
 to is
 
Sir
 
Donald
Acheson's witness statement to the BSE
 
Inquiry which is
at MHRA0011433.  We've seen the report that 
was
 written
in the year 2000.  He gave this witness statement in the
October of 1998
, 
before -- well we can see at the top
here was scheduled to give oral evidence in
November 1998.
Can we 
go
 to page 4 of that document, please, and
focus on the bottom paragraph from the subheading
"
The
 
Role of the Chief Medical Officer
"
.  He there set
out his view of the role as at that time.  He noted
that
:
"
The Chief Medical Officer 
[
was
]
 the principal
adviser on medical and public health matters, not only
to Ministers in the Department of Health but to 
the
Ministers in other government departments and to the
Government as 
a 
whole
.
"
He reiterates 
the
 observation we've seen already
,
that the field over which the CMO is required to provide
 
10
advice extends far beyond his own personal professional
experience.
He says:
"
It
 is 
therefore
 necessary for him 
to
 
be
 supported
by an extensive advisory machinery.  
In
 
addition
 to
a number of expert Standing Committees ... he has at his
disposal 
a 
panel of upwards of about 
eighty
 personal
consultant advisers drawn from the top ranks of the
medical profession and covering all the special
i
ties."
So the role of the consultant adviser is an
interesting one.  That was the position as at 1998 when
the panel had developed and enlarged since the period
we're looking at in the 1980s and we can see that if we
go
 to NHBT0001065, which will be
, 
when 
it
 comes up
, 
the
minutes of the consultant advisers meeting on
27 November 1981.
I 
go
 here to the first half of the page, please,
just to demonstrate that the specialisms at that time
,
including
 
apologies for absence
, 
numbered just seven,
but even at this time
, 
when there were just seven
specialties represented, there was 
a 
consultant adviser
for blood transfusion
, 
who was at that time Dr Gunson.
This was his first meeting.  He commenced in that role
that year, replacing Dr Geoffrey Tovey.
Dr Walford, who as I mentioned was one of the
 
11
DCMOs
, 
has given evidence that she found Dr Gunson 
to
 
be
accessible and helpful as 
a 
consultant adviser and was
pleased that he'd taken over the role.
The relevant evidence on that issue is set out at
paragraph 23 of the written presentation.  I don't 
go
 to
it now.
I'm just going to go back, please, to MHRA0011433,
which is back to the witness statement of Donald Acheson
for the BSE Inquiry
, 
and 
could
 we 
go
 to page 5, please,
and focus on paragraph 14 in the middle of the page
,
where Sir
 
Donald
 
Acheson said that
:
"
The term 
'
Chief
 
Medical Officer
' [
was
]
 
a 
misnomer
as 
it
 implies that the CMO leads 
a 
national hierarchy
.
While the CMO may offer guidance on medical or public
health matters to all doctors or 
to 
Directors of Public
Health, neither he nor his predecessors
, 
at least since
1919
, 
have had 
a 
line management or any power of
direction
 ..."
So this 
is
 coming back to the issue of whether
there's 
a 
power to direct 
the
 medical profession.
He says that:
"
... 
at best CMO may be 
seen
 as
 primus inter
pares
."
I don't 
have the 
Latin translation
, 
I'm afraid
,
Sir Brian

So that is at MRCO000
0
554_005.
This is the leaflet that went to all household
s
.
We can see at the bottom of the page 
it
 says 
"
Government
Information 1987
".  
It's quite 
hard-hitting.  
Probably
people will be familiar with the slogan
 "
AIDS
, 
don't die
of ignorance
".  
And if we just look at the next page, to
give 
a 
flavour
: 
"
Why are you being sent this leaflet
?  
"
This leaflet is being sent to every household in
the country
."
And 
it
 talks about matters 
of
 health and sex
.  
If
we 
go
 to the next page
, 
when aske
d, "
How do you become
infected
?", 
it
 explains
, "
Because the virus can be
present in semen and vaginal fluid
", and 
talks about the
danger of sexual intercourse, vaginal or anal sex.
So at this point Norman Fowler and Donald Acheson
have won the argument about using clearer terminology in
public health information.
We're looking at the details of 
a 
leaflet which
might be thought 
to
 
be
 too forensic for 
a 
presentation
about the Chief Medical Officer who was responsible for
policy advice but
,
 
in fact,
 we know from Lord Fowler
, as
evidence he told the Inquiry
, 
that every advertisement
in this campaign was approved personally by himself 
and
 
102
the
 Chief Medical Officer.  So his evidence is that
Sir Donald Acheson looked at each of the adverts that
went out, including this leaflet, and approved them.
The next topic in the written presentation is the
introduction of heat treatment.  I don't propose to go
in detail through that topic or the documents pertaining
to that topic.  They are dealt with at paragraphs 153 to
162 of the written presentation for those who want to
look.
What those documents show 
is
 
that
 
the
 Chief
Medical Officer kept abreast of the developments in
relation to heat treated Factor VIII and there's just
one document that I will pick up on which is at
DHSC0000514.
We can see that on 30 July 1985 Sir Donald Acheson
wrote to the Secretary of State
, 
who was 
Sir
 
Norman
Fowler
, 
about AIDS 
and
 the treatment of haemophiliacs.
He says
, 
following
 
their
 
recent conversation
 
he has
checked on the position regarding the treatment of
haemophiliacs
 
with Factor VIII
, 
and he has been advised
that all Factor VIII produced at the Blood Products
Laboratory has been heat
-
treated since April 1985.
He talks about the importance of avoiding using
any commercial unheat-treated Factor VIII which may
remain from 1984
.
 
103
Then 
in 
the final paragraph says he's satisfied
that it's extremely unlikely that any patients with
haemophilia 
treated in the 
UK will in future be infected
with HTLV-III virus.
Then 
it
 is quite interesting to see that he added
a 
personal manuscript addition.  We know it's him
because in Norman Fowler's evidence he says this was the
manuscript 
addition
 from Sir Donald Acheson
.  
He says:
"
- 
but 
sad
ly 
a 
very high proportion of the
haemophilic population already are infected due to
previous use of non
 
heat
 
treated Factor VIII."
So that was his personal reflection at that time.
The next topic I will deal with similarly by
reference to the written presentation and that's the
topic of consent to testing.
Paragraphs 163 to 172 of the written presentation
deal with the theme of consents to testing and
anonymised testing.
The documents show that Sir Donald Acheson sought
advice and ultimately considered that this was an issue
for ministers to decide, but I won't take us through the
documents now.
I will pick up on 
a 
few documents relating to
Sir Donald Acheson's views on compensation for HIV
infection.  The Inquiry has heard considerable evidence
 
104
about the litigation brought between 1988 and 1991 by
people with haemophilia who had been infected with HIV
as a result of use of blood products.
Sir Donald Acheson met with the Minister of State
for Health to discuss that litigation on 30 August 1989
,
but 
other
wise he doesn't appear to have been heavily
personally involved in the Government's response to that
litigation.
However,
 there is one letter he wrote which we'll
go
 to
, 
which is at HSOC0017025
_
004.  We can see that
this is 
a 
letter from 
the Chief Medical Officer 
to the
Secretary of State
, 
who was by then 
Sir
 Kenneth Clarke
,
dated 20 July 1980 
(sic), 
and if we 
could
 just zoom in
on the paragraph he said that he hoped that the
Secretary of State would take --

--Result #635--

  
Referring to the AIDS litigation, he was
commenting on an intervention of the trial judge,
Mr Justice Ognall, who had urged all sides to consider
a 
compromise and Sir Donald wrote:
 

7 July 2022
          
          

  105
"I hope Secretary of State will take account of my
view that the problem of HIV infection in haemophiliacs
can
 
in fact
 
be regarded as 
a 
unique catastrophe.  The
key feature which is not brought out particularly well
in the memorandum of the Directors of Public Health 
is
that HIV infection
 
in addition
 to almost inevitably
causing 
a 
very unpleasant progressive illness and death
,
results in a substantial proportion of cases 
in
infection of the female sexual partner and also on
average 
one
 
quarter of the 
subsequently
 conceived
children
.  In
 both wife and children the infection will
also prove fatal
; 
in the case of the children fatality
takes place in infancy.  The only remedy which will
certainly prevent the transmission b
y 
sexual contact is
the invariable use of 
a 
condom throughout the
partnership.  Unlike the position 
in 
Hepatitis B which
can 
occur 
as 
the 
result of 
a 
therapeutic accident
, 
there
is no vaccination available to protect the sexual
partner.  Furthe
rmore, 
in Hepatitis B the outcome is
only rarely 
fatal and infectiveness 
is present in
a small minority of cases."
Then if we 
could
 
go
 to page 2
, 
please, he goes on
summarise the particular aspects of infection with HIV
and says that the tragedy goes beyond anything which has
ever been described as a result of 
a 
therapeutic
 
106
accident and is very likely 
indeed
 never to occur again.
Then what he is requesting in this letter he says
in the final paragraph:
"I hope 
therefore
, 
that for humanitarian reasons
the Government will find some 
way
 to make an
 ex gratia
settlement 
to
 
the
 infected haemophiliacs in relation to
this unique tragedy.  I cannot personally see how these
could be regarded as implying any responsibility for
other accidents such as benzodiazepine depende
nce,
cerebral 
palsy following obstetric misadventure
 etc
."
So that was his request to the Secretary of State.
We've got one more letter in relation to possible
settlement
, 
which is at DHSC0004365_015.
This is 
a 
letter of 5 December 1990 which
Dr Hilary Pickles wrote to CMO.  As I mentioned earlier
,
Dr Hilary Pickles worked at DHSS in the AIDS unit and
she wrote to express her concern.  She said she
:
"... 
spoke to him 
this 
morning about 
my
 concern at
the possible implications of one of the options being
considered for our 
[
Secretary of State
]
 to use in
tomorrow's discussion
s
 with the Chief Secretary
.
"
She said that
:
"... 
this presents the best arguments for
encouraging Treasury to cover settlement cost
s
 and could
be used for 
'
ring-fencing
'
 this deal
, 
it
 may be very
 
107
difficult to present 
this 
line of argument in a 
way
which does not damage the reputation of the
professionals concern
ed.  
If there is said 
to
 
be
 
a 
risk
of losing which is sufficient to justify 
a 
settlement
,
then either the case is weak because there was
negligence
 
or the judge and legal system 
[
is
]
 biased
,
yet neither of these reasons are ones we 
could
/
should
use."
When asked about this letter in her oral evidence,
Dr 
Pickles 
said that it was very unusual for her to
write to 
a 
Chief Medical Officer in this format and 
she
said 
it was obvious that she had had 
a 
discussion with
him and he said 
"
put that in writing
"
 so he 
could
 then
put on the record that he felt there had been no
negligence.
So we only have the letter to him and we don't
have any reply from him
, 
but we do have her evidence
that he had asked her to put that in writing.  So we
have on the one hand 
a 
letter asking for 
a 
settlement 
to
be
 favourably considered by the Secretary of State and
then we have Dr Pickles' evidence that to some 
extent
 he
supported her concern that that shouldn't result in any
implication of negligence or damage to the reputation of
clinicians.
Then there's 
a 
related although slightly different
 
108
issue where we have documents showing Sir Donald
Acheson's view on compensation.
Can we 
go
,
 please
,
 to DHSC0004365_015.  Is that
a 
wrong ... let me see.  We'll 
go
 first then
, 
I think
,
to DHSC0002862_006.
What this is
, 
is 
a 
communication setting out
Sir Donald Acheson's view on 
a 
minute which I will find
the reference to and take us to next
, 
if I
 
can
.  
But for
context the issue was whether to extend financial
support to people who did not have haemophilia but who
had been infected with HIV through the use of blood and
,
in rare cases
,
 blood products.
He says that he's seen the minute about that issue
and about the cost that would be incurred if the
compensation scheme for haemophiliacs were 
to
 
be
extended
.  
He has commented that he thinks that
:
"... 
the only tenable argument of
a 
differentiation from haemophilia of any weight is 
in
paragraph 3 of Annex A
.
"
And if I can
, 
I will take you there momentarily.
He 
said that:
"The 
number of cases arising from other types of
'
tissue transplan
ting' 
eg organ transplants
, 
and sperm
would be unlikely to go 
beyond the fingers of both
hands, maximum.  CMO would be concerned with 'spread' 
to
 

7 July 2022
          
          

  109
hepatitis cases of various sorts."
So he's 
there expressing some dubiousness about
arguments being made to refuse the extension of
compensation to victims of infected blood who did not
have haemophilia
, 
but at the same time noting 
a 
concern
was spread to hepatitis cases of various sorts.  So he's
not 
en
thusiastically campaigning for widespread
compensation by any means.
Then 
could
 w
e go, please, 
to DHSC000356
0
_051
.
This is the document with 
a 
note on
 
the:
"... 
present position on compensation for people
infected with HIV through blood transfusion
, and 
on the
costs which would be incurred if we were to extend to
them 
a 
compensation scheme for haemophiliacs.
"
And if we 
go
 to annex A, please, which should be
at page 2
, 
and then 
go
 through to page 4 and look at
paragraph 3
.  
So 
this is paragraph 3 of annex A
.  
The only
argument which Sir Donald Acheson thought might 
tenably
hold 
any weight 
was 
a 
distinction between haemophiliacs
and those without haemophilia who were victims of
infected blood
, 
because haemophiliacs were doubly
disadvantaged by the pre-existing haemophilia
, 
which
affected 
their employment, mortgage and insurance
prospects, and 
by their HIV infection
, 
and because the
 
110
hereditary nature of haemophilia can mean that more than
one member of the family might be infected.
So he was there to an 
extent
 supporting an
argument for 
a 
distinction in disadvantage
, 
but I think
that's as far as I can probably take 
it
 from the limited
response that we have from him.
So those are the documents chronologically that
I wanted to take you to.  I mentioned that I would come
back towards the end of the presentation to two
particular categories of documents and the first was the
what is referred to as "Dear Doctor" letters
.  
So one of
the functions of the Chief Medical Officer
, 
as we've
heard
, 
is public guidance on health issues and one means
he had of disseminating advice and guidance was in
letters to the medical profession
, 
but we've seen in his
witness statement to the BSE Inquiry that he considered
himself first among equals and that 
it
 wasn't his place
to
 
be
 directive.
We looked at the first letter that was sent out
about AIDS in the May of 1985, which 
took
 
a 
fairly
polite and humble tone in encouraging doctors to accept
his advice if it were 
to
 
be
 helpful.
Just 
a 
note on frequency.  Set out at paragraph 31
of the written presentation are all of the "Dear Doctor"
letters pertaining to infected blood issues in the 1980s
 
111
which the Inquiry has so far identified.  Sir Henry
Yellowlees sent 
three 
on the topic of hepatitis B in the
period from 1981 to 1984.  Sir Donald Acheson sent nine
on the topic of AIDS between 1985 and 1990.  So there
was an increase in frequency of "Dear Doctor" letters on
infected blood topics.  That doesn't mean to 
say
 there
was necessarily an increase of "Dear Doctor" letters in
all
, 
because we haven't examined the letters which went
on other issues.
We've looked at two letters so far.  One was on
the introduction of HIV testing 
in
 
general
 facilities
and one was on the public education 
campaigner in the
December of 1986 and I'm just going to pick up on two
more
 -- 
sorry
, 
we've looked at three so far
: 
one was the
initial information on AIDS, the second was on the
introduction of general testing and the third was on
public education and I'm going to pick up on two more.
The first I want to pick up on is at DHSC0000177
,
and 
could
 we 
go
 to page 2, please.  So you will recall
that we looked at 
a 
document showing the publicity round
that Sir Donald Acheson engaged in on 1 October 1985
when HTLV-III testing was introduced in blood
transfusion centres and it referred to 
a 
"Dear Doctor"
letter of the same date.  This is that letter.  He
refers back to his letter of 15 May with the
 "
General
 
112
Information for Doctors
"
 about AIDS.  He also refers
back to the information he'd previously circulated about
alternative facilities for providing antibody tests at
sexual health clinics and through GPs and, just below
the (a) and (b
), 
we can see that he says:
"The synchronous provision of these arrangements
is to ensure that people who believe themselves at risk
of infection do not donate blood in order 
to
 
be
 tested.
This is crucial because even 
a 
reliable test cannot
detect very early infections to which an antibody
response has not yet been generated
.
"
Goes
 on to talk about 
arrangements 
for counselling
those people.
Now this again relates back to the concern flagged
in internal briefings about the possibility of creating
an incentive for people from 
high-risk
 groups to donate
blood in order to get 
tested and that 
being 
a 
factor in
the 
way
 that testing was rolled out.  He goes on to say
that:
"It
 is 
essential that all individuals who are
found
 to have positive 
... 
tests receive
counselling
 ...
"
Then over the page he
 
talks about counselling
services, training services for 
counsellors, 
and 
he
concludes 
by saying
:
 

7 July 2022
          
          

  113
"
The antibody test 
is 
an important tool
, 
in the
control of the spread of HTLV
 
III infection
.  
If 
it
 is
to
 
be
 used effectively
, 
very
 
strict confidentiality must
be maintained in respect of positive results
 ...
"
You may reflect on the tone of this letter when
compared to the very first letter he sent out to doctors
regarding AIDS.  
It
 is
, 
or 
it
 could be 
inferred 
to
 
be
more directive and more urgent in the 
way
 he sets out
what must be done rather than saying here is some
information for your benefit should you choose to look
at 
it
.
Then there's just one more "Dear Doctor" letter
that it would be interesting to go to.
It's at BART00000728
.  
This is on 14 January 1986.  So this follows on
from the "Dear Doctor" letter that we saw in December --
no
, 
it
 doesn't
, 
I'm sorry.  There will be 
a 
letter in
December of 1986.  I've got 
my chronology 
confused.
This is 
a 
stand
-
alone letter of 14 January 1986 entitled
"
Children at school and problems related to AIDS
", and
it
 mentions that the previous autumn
, 
so in autumn 1985
,
following publ
icity
 about 
a 
schoolchild who was found 
to
be
 infected with HTLV-III
, 
the Government undertook to
issue guidance on AIDS as 
it
 affects schools and the
letter appends an information book
let
 on that topic.
 
114
If we look at the third paragraph on the page,
please, he says that
:
"
Doctors 
also 
have an important role to play in
achieving 
improved
 health education on the HTLV
 
III
infection.  Members of the general public who have
worries about AIDS and 
those
 who are directly involved
with infected people need 
to
 
be
 told about the nature of
the HTLV
 
III infection and reassured about the limited
ways 
it
 can 
be 
spread."
So when you are thinking about stigma and
combating stigma I've also referred earlier in this
presentation to occasions on which 
it
 might be 
inferred
that it was part of the CMO's role to address
misinformation as well as promote information.  This
letter is quite interesting because it's really geared
at the stigma that might be experienced particularly by
children in schools.
The other category of document which it would be
interesting to look at is that of the annual reports
which we have come to bit by bit as they are relevant to
the other themes that we have looked at.  They are set
out from paragraph 45 onwards of the written
presentation and what's interesting looking at them
collectively in relation to the risk of AIDS is to see
how the space devoted to the topic and the prominence in
 
115
which that information is placed develops throughout the
1980s.
So we looked at the 1983 annual report.  If we put
it
 back up on screen
, 
it's DHSC0007004
, 
and if we could
go
,
 please
,
 to page 61
.  
This was the part
,
 
sir,
 that you 
took
 us to in the
"
Communicable diseases
"
 section
, 
on
 "
Kaposi's sarcoma
and AIDS
", 
noting the reporting to the CDSC.
So approximately half 
a 
page there
, 
and then the
brief section that we looked at was at page 70, please,
just the paragraph that goes over to the top of the next
page noting the appearance of this new and frequently
fatal syndrome and saying merely that the cause was
unknown.
The next year
, 
the 1984 annual report is at
DHSC0007005.  This was the year that we looked at that
Sir Donald Acheson signed off the report but
acknowledged that the work had been done during the year
of Sir Henry Yellowlees' tenure
.
At page 54, please, we can see that there is
a
 
one-page
 
section on AIDS.  
It
 just goes on to the next
page as well and 
it
 notes the number of cases in the USA
and the steps taken in the UK
.
Then
, 
just over to the next page
, "
UK
 
research
"
and the establishment of the MRC AIDS Working Party.
 
116
Then at page 66
, in the "
Sexually Transmitted
Diseases
"
 section
, 
there's 
a 
further two paragraphs
giving the 
statistics
, 
noting that in the USA at that
point there had been 
a 
cumulative total of 3,000 cases
to the end of 1983
, 
with 
a 
mortality rate of
43 per cent
.  
Noting the surveillance of 
AIDS 
in the UK
by CDSC
, 
to the end of 1983 there had been 31 cases and
16 of them had died
 -- 
16 of those patients
, 
sorry
, 
had
died
 -- 
and that the cause remained unknown, but this
year it says:
"... [it] is likely to be a viral agent
transmitted 
by 
sexual contact
, 
transfusion of blood and
certain blood products
.  The 
incubation period can be as
long as three
 
years or more."
So the difference between 1982 report and 1983
report
, 
bearing in mind they are each published the
subsequent year
, 
is that the cause is set out in the
1983 report whereas in the 1982 report it was just said
to
 
be
 unknown.
Then in 1984 it's at DHSC0007006, please.  This
annual report was published in 1986
.  
The introduction
by 
Sir Donald Acheson was dated the October of 1985.
For the first time
, 
in this report
, 
AIDS is featured in
the introduction to the report
, 
so 
could
 we 
go
,
 please
,
to page 8.  We can see there that under the public
 

7 July 2022
          
          

  117
health section of the introduction it's noted that there
has been 
a major
 step forward in identifying the causal
agent
, 
that there had been an increase in the number of
cases and 
a 
reference to the need for the control of the
spread of the infection 
to
 
be
 regarded as an issue of
prime importance to the future of the nation.
So by the time Sir Donald Acheson signed off on
this introduction in October 1985, 
it
 postdates what he
said in his autobiography to have been the realisation
of the gravity of the issue in early 1985 and in his
annual report that was published subsequent to that
realisation he is saying in a public document that the
need for the control of the spread of infection was 
to
be
 regard
ed
 as an issue of prime importance to the
future of the nation.
There's also 
a 
much longer section in this report
in the 
"
Communicable diseases
"
 chapter.  That's at
page
 
41, please.  It's the bottom two paragraphs in that
page and we'll look here, before going on to the next
couple of pages.
In the 1984 report
, 
it's noted that 77
 
cases of
AIDS had been reported in the UK between 1 January and
31 December
, 
that was on top of 
a 
previous 31 cases
reported up to the end of 1983
, 
and that by the end of
1984
, 
108 cases had been reported to the CDSC.  There
 
118
had been three cases of people with haemophilia and
notes a number of patients with Kaposi's sarcoma
,
pneumocystic 
carinii 
pneumonia and other opportunistic
infections.
If we can 
go
 over the page
, 
please
.  
From this
report 
onwards
, 
there are fairly detailed 
statistics
provided in relation to various aspects of the disease.
So here we're looking at presentations and
, 
if we 
could
scroll down, please, there's 
a 
section on transmission
by blood and blood products in the UK and it's noted
that
:
"... 
three recipients were known to have become
HTLV III 
antibody positive following blood 
donations
from one donor who subsequently 
developed AIDS
.  
The
plasma from one on his 
donations also 
contaminated
a 
batch of Factor VIII.  During 1984 there were no cases
of AIDS arising from this or other blood transfusions
."
But 
three haemophiliacs had developed AIDS and two
had died after receiving imported commercial
Factor VIII.
Then the next section is
 "
Measures
 Taken to
Control the Spread of AIDS
"
 and 
this really 
picks up on
some 
of the chronology that 
we
 
have
 already looked at.
There's the establishment of EAGA
.  
Then on the next
page
 
leaflets and guidance provided by the Advisory
 
119
Committee on dangerous pathogens 
and the 
Health
Education Council
, 
and the introduction of
 -- 
or the
work done on the introduction of screening and the use
of the AIDS and blood donors leaflet in transfusion
centres, work done on heat treatment, and the work
towards self-sufficiency.  So outlining the various
limbs or 
measures
 that were at that point 
being
 worked
on to address the spread of AIDS.  There's 
a 
section on
international collaboration
.  
Then over on the next
page, please
 -- 
oh
, 
no
, 
that's 
the 
end.
So 
it
 is two and a half pages 
in
 
"
Communicable
diseases
"
 and then the another section under the
"
Sexually Transmitted Disease
s", 
or 
the "
Sexually
Transmitted Disease
s" 
chapter
, which is 
at page 56
.
It's 
a 
brief paragraph but 
it
 sets out there the
statistics
 and notes the uncertainty about how many
people who are infected with HTLV would develop AIDS.
It
 says at that point 
it
 is certain 
to
 
be
 at least
10 per cent.
When 
it
 says
 "
AIDS is discussed in more detail
",
that's the section we just looked at.
The 1985 annual report is at DHSC007007
.  
This
report was published the following year and Sir Donald
Acheson's introduction is dated July of 1986.  This
report again featured 
a 
section on AIDS in the
 
120
introduction
, 
which is at page 12.
If we just focus
,
 please
,
 on the 
"
Communicable
diseases
"
 
at
 
the
 bottom
, 
it's noted that
:
"
The spread of HTLV
 
III 
... 
within the population
of the UK
, 
and 
... 
throughout the world
, 
provides one of
the greatest challenges in communicable disease control
in this century.
"
So the emphasis and tone in this report
, 
as in the
previous year's report
, 
is really focused on the gravity
of the issue and is consistent with Sir Donald Acheson's
autobiography and what he says about the prominence and
priority which he accorded to AIDS.
He 
goes on 
to say that the key feature which makes
control of spread difficult is that infection is 
usually
transmitted by sexual intercourse with persons who are
often unaware that they are 
carrying 
the virus and notes
that there is a latent period of up to five years
between the date of infection and the development of the
illness
, 
but also says that not all carriers 
of
antibodies develop the syndrome.
Then at the bottom of the page 
it
 
says:
"In the 
absence of an
y 
antiviral drug 
or effective
vaccine we have limited means at our disposal.  
The
three most important means to control the virus 
are
first
 
informing public on how the infection is and is
 

7 July 2022
          
          

  121
not spread
, 
providing 
a 
safe supply of blood
 and blood
products and 
advising infected persons on how they might
avoid infecting others."
Then 
it
 goes on to say:
"Public education is essential.  Programmes should
be aimed at the general public as well as persons
actually or possibly at risk
.  
It
 is essential that
everyone receives accurate information and that 
myths
are exposed."
So that's consistent with Sir Donald Acheson's
preoccupation during 1986 with the need for effective
and efficient public health information on AIDS.
It
 goes on to note testing and guidelines 
being
introduced.
So that was just the introduction.  There was then
seven pages on AIDS under the 
"
Communicable diseases
"
chapter
, 
which is at page 49.  I won't 
go
 through all
seven pages but 
it
 can be seen that the 
statistics
provided were broken down in a fairly detailed manner
.
So they include
, 
if we 
go
 down please, under
"
Characteristics of AIDS patients
", 
numbers of people
who are recipients of blood who have contracted AIDS.
If we 
scroll
 out again, please, and back out, please,
and then to the next page, please, the control methods
are then set out in a great deal more detail but it's
 
122
similar information that we saw in the introduction as
expanded in the chapter.
Would that be 
a 
convenient moment to take an
afternoon break?  I'm aware that we've got 
a 
few more
annual reports to go
, 
but we won't take all of this
afternoon's allocated time
.

--Result #636--

On the HIV Litigation, we do have 
one
 minute from you,
which is at SCGV0000229_052
, 
and it is a minute that was
sent to 
Mr Forsyth 
at that time
.  
It is dated
15 February 1989
, so 
Mr Forsyth
, 
I think
, 
would still
have been the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State of
the Scottish Office and it refers to a 
Daily Record
article date 6 January 1989, 
entitled "You Gave Us
AIDS".  The reason for the minute is explained in
 

19 July 2022
          
          

  121
paragraph 1, the minister requested advice on the
Daily Record article.
A little background is give in paragraphs 2 and
 3
about a series of articles on the campaign 
for
compensation and financial support
, 
and reference is
made to the establishment of the Macfarlane Trust in
November
 1987
.  
Then at 
point
 4
, 
it says this:
"In an
 
attempt to gain further compensation, some
of the 75 haemophiliacs in Scotland who are HIV positive
have raised actions in the Court of Session -- alleging
negligence by the NHS."
Just on that paragraph, do you know where the
figure
 
of 75 would have come from?

--Result #637--

Let me turn briefly to the compensation and indemnity
arrangements for the Z8 trials.  This is dealt with in
your statement at section 50.  And you also make
reference to the relevant chapter of Lord Penrose's
report, I think chapter 24, on this.
I'm not going to go through it in detail.  It
appears that the issue is a concern expressed
,
principally by Dr Ludlam
, 
about the provisions for
comp
ensation 
for patients who suffered adverse effects
in the trials of Z8.  It was raised for several years,
not in respect of Z8 more generally, with the SHHD
before you joined.  Raised with you personally in
December 1986 and January 1987, by which stage there was
an acute risk, as it were, 
that
 it could delay the
trials.
You then stepped in, made arrangements
 
and
, it
 
131
seems
, 
were able to resolve at least the initial part
of it fairly quickly
, 
and 
then
 a 
wider
 scheme was
introduced later that autumn.
Now, from your knowledge at the time
, and from
 the
papers you 
saw
 both at the time and since, are you able
to say why it was that such a scheme 
hadn't
 been
introduced before your intervention?

--Result #638--

Yes
.  It was because it was a difficult nut to crack.
You asked earlier about whether Treasury approval was
necessary to fund surrogate testing
, 
and my answer to
that was 
no
, 
that was not one of the areas of our work
that required specific Treasury approval.  But the issue
of compensation payments to anyone are
 -- 
an agreement
to make a payment in an insurance sort of way
 
did
require specific Treasury approval.  So it wasn't
something that one often did; it was rather
 -- 
it was
rather unusual and potentially difficult
.
Secondly, the issue initially was complicated by
confusion about exactly what it was, exactly what
circumstance Chris Ludlam wanted compensation triggered
.
And I should explain that it wasn't
 
that compensation
 --
that patients were infected and eligible for
compensation; it was Chris's fear that they might be
 --
they might be hardened by the non-therapeutic use of the
product in clinical trials
.
 
132
As far as I know, nobody was harmed, and
the
 
compensation scheme which we set up was never
needed.  So it was a little difficult to pin down
exactly what Chris Ludlam wanted 
compensated
 for
 
and
before my time in SHHD, my colleagues
, 
or
 my future
colleagues
 
asked the CSA to come up with a scheme.  That
wasn't a ridiculous request because the CSA not only had
the Blood Transfusion Service, therefore conscious
 --
more conscious than the Department about the
circumstances in which compensation might be called for
,
but also the Central Legal Office
, 
which had an
understandable knowledge of the legal aspects of
compensation schemes
.
However, it -- I think because it wasn't an urgent
matter, and it was a difficult matter, nothing seemed to
have been done, or a grasp was never taken of the issue
until Chris Ludlam gave his ultimatum
: 
"
I won't try the
product on patients until this compensation scheme is in
effect."
Once
 that ultimatum had been issued and the matter
narrowed down to a particular point in the trialling of
products, 
I got a grip 
of it, it was 
easy
 to resolve,
Treasury approved it very quickly, and the conclusion of
Lord Penrose's Inquiry was that the start to
the
 
clinical trials was perhaps slightly postponed by
 

19 July 2022
          
          

  133
a matter of weeks, but the trials were completed before
the product was ready for application to patients, so 
no
time was
, 
in the end
, 
lost
.
But it wasn't the most sparkling example of
departmental administration.  And that is the reason for
it.  It was a complicated matter which required Treasury
approval.  It didn't appear urgent until Chris Ludlam's
ultimatum.

--Result #639--

-- I think
 
exceptional.  We based the compensation on
 
135
ABPI
, 
Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry
, 
guidelines
, 
so it must have been precedented
,
but I think it was very unusual, which is why we had to
break the ground with a blood product
, 
which is
a slightly out of the ordinary pharmaceutical product
.

--Result #640--

Yes
, 
and that was the point, I think, that Chris Ludlam
was most worried about.  He found it 
hard
 -- 
and one can
understand it, and I understood it at the time
 -- 
he
found it 
hard
 to recommend to patients that they
participate with 
no
 safety net of compensation if
something went wrong.  In the unlikely 
e
vent that
something went wrong and
, 
as I've said, nothing did in
fact go wrong.

--Result #641--

Not the example that I've given you on hospices because
 

20 July 2022
          
          

  37
it was within our agreed allocation, but if, 
for
example
, I had wanted to introduce a compensation
scheme
, 
which I think is where your questioning is
leading us, that absolutely would have to be approved by
the Treasury because it would involve committing
resources and it would be a marked change in the policy
as 
agreed 
with the Department of Health
.

--Result #642--

You say at paragraph 27.3 of your statement that there
were occasions when the Department of Health did not
take 
account
 of Scottish circumstances and moved ahead
without proper consultation, particularly around the
issue of
 
compensation.  And we'll come to the issue of
compensation in due course but are there any other
examples where you felt that the Department of Health
was moving ahead without proper consultation?

--Result #643--

Well, they decided that -- on introducing testing.  We
touched on this earlier.  They decided to go ahead with
that
 
and
, 
as far as I was concerned, there had not
really been any proper consultation.  I mean
, 
I think we
had about
, 
sort of
, 
six
 
weeks to turn that round
.  
But
,
I mean
, 
I 
hadn't
 got an issue with that particularly
other than the timescale, a precautionary bid had been
put in, in the public expenditure's requirement.
They did tend to
, 
sort of
, 
charge 
on, 
I mean
, 
if
you're going to come on to the issue of compensation
.
And also the extent to which compensation should be
covered
, 
they took a view which was at variance with my
own view as a junior minister and on which I don't
recall being consulted at all and on which 
my 
officials
were well aware of what my view was.

--Result #644--

So 
it's 
from Mr 
Lugton
, dated 
6
 October 1987
, 
to your
private secretary.
"
1.  
Dr Lowe has written to the Minister to
express concern about the difficulties of haemophiliacs
who have 
become
 infected with HIV through contaminated
blood products 
administered
 by the National Health
Service.  The Haemophilia Society are about to launch
a campaign for special assistance from the Government
for this group to help them with their health
difficulties, and to provide life assurance and mortgage
protection.  Dr Lowe is concerned also about the cost
s
of counselling patients and their families who attend
the West of Scotland Haemophilia Centre and asks for
specific funding.
"
2.  
There was an earlier round of correspondence
on this subject in January 
this
 year when Ministers took
the line that, while the Government have the greatest
sympathy for haemophiliacs who have been infected with
HIV, there is 
no
 
State
 scheme to compensate those who
unfortunately suffer any adverse 
[
effect
s]
 from their
medical treatment, that such a scheme was considered
,
and rejected, by an independent commission some time ago
 
51
and that compensation may be awarded by the courts where
negligence has been proved
.
"
3.  
In 
the 
light of a forthcoming campaign by the
Haemophilia Society, the Secretary of State for Social
Services minuted to the Prime Minister on 
24
 September
(copy 
of minute
 attached) indicating that, having
re-examined the case for compensation, he had concluded
that the previous line was right.  An
y
 special
arrangements for compensation for haemophiliacs would
cost at least £3 million and it would be logically
difficult to distinguish the claim by haemophiliacs from
claims of others damaged in the course of their medical
treatment.  The Prime Minister has noted the minute from
the Secretary of State for Social Services without
comment
.
"
And a draft reply is then attached.
So
 
going back to my question
, 
do you know why it
was that Dr Lowe's letter was brought to the attention
of your Private Office
?

--Result #645--

I don't remember but I agreed with much of the content
 
52
of that letter.  The response which is -- the covering
note from Mr 
Lugton
 I think makes a really important
point where he says
 
it would be logically difficult to
distinguish the claims from haemophiliacs from claims
from others damaged during the course of their medical
treatment
.
I don't know what the sequencing is here, but my
own view was that what had happened to the
haemophiliacs
, 
but not just the haemophiliacs, the
people who had had blood transfusions and who had also
had tissue implants or things of that kind, who had then
become
 infected by HIV, it seemed to me 
it 
was such
a horrendous and exceptional circumstance that a payment
should be made
.
The difficulty was that
, 
particularly in the
Department of Health and
 -- 
the advice was
, 
how could we
do this without creating a situation where a precedent
was established so that anyone who suffered from
a genuine medical accident in the Health Service would
be entitled to compensation?
My own personal view was that it was distinct and
the impact of the infection was so catastrophic and
severe on the individuals and their families concerned
that we should find a way round it and
 -- 
round that
particular problem.  So it a later stage
 -- 
just to get
 

20 July 2022
          
          

  53
this all clear
 -- 
so at a later stage, when it was
suggested that the Macfarlane Trust could be set up and
ex gratia payments made, I welcomed that, but then the
argument which
 -- 
interestingly
,
 in Mr Lugton's note
,
which he anticipates
 -- 
then the argument became
, "
Oh
,
well,
 we need to distinguish between those people who
were haemophiliacs and those people who had blood
transfusions
".  
And I thought logically there was
absolutely 
no
 distinction
 -- 
and 
fairly, 
an injustice
 --
there was no distinction that could be made
.
And that, I think, was an argument about the costs
as much as
 -- 
the argument about creating a precedent
for providing compensation where there were medical
accidents
 
was driven by cost considerations.

--Result #646--

Well
, it doesn't really matter whether it was a small
number or a large number
: 
the principle is the same.
And the issue of whether it would have been possible
 --
I mean
, 
the fundamental
 -- 
certainly
, in 
my
understanding at the time, looking at the papers, it
hasn't changed
 -- 
the fundamental problem was the belief
amongst some officials and some ministers that to do
 
56
something in this area by way of compensation would
create a precedent
, 
which would result in enormous
liabilities falling on the Health Service
, 
because it
would effectively introduce some kind of 
no
-fault
entitlement to compensation.
I didn't think that was the case
 
and
, 
now, 
with
the
 benefit of 30 years hindsight
, 
it's hard to argu
e
that that argument was sustained.  I can't just remember
the exact number but the last time I think I read about
this, I mean
, 
the Health Service is spending something
like 2 billion a year on cases which -- where negligence
has been proved.  But
, 
in this case
, 
I didn't think that
was a practical position
 
and
, 
at each stage in the
argument
 -- 
I mean
, 
this went on
, 
what, for three or
four years
 -- 
at each stage in the argument where
an
 
attempt was placed to put a ring-fence around
particular groups
 -- 
haemophiliacs or people 
who'd
 been
infected with HIV from transfusions
 -- 
in the end, and
mainly
, I would suggest, because of the strength of the
public campaign
 
the logic of the position, which is set
out in Mr Lugton's note, became difficult to resist.

--Result #647--

Well, I did what I could and didn't give up on the
argument.  But I thought the point that was made in that
letter
, 
that the numbers were small
 
and that 
we
 could do
something on our own, I didn't think 
that 
that was
practical, because it required to take on this big
argument about opening up the Health Service to making
payments regardless of blame, which I 
understood
 that
argument
, 
which is 
why, as 
I said a few moments ago,
which I why I said I thought the setting up the
Macfarlane Trust was a-- and we stopped talking about
compensation and started talking about ex gratia
payments, was the right line to take.

--Result #648--

Okay
.  
Well,
 it's possible.  There's nothing in the
papers you provided me
, 
and 
I've
 
no
 recollection of
being asked what appropriate level of compensation was,
but I certainly would have been pleased that some
 
66
progress had been made on the principle of 
actually
making a paper and finding a way often doing it which
got round the way of doing it of the issue of creating
an -- as
 some people 
saw
 
it, an 
unwelcome precedent
.

--Result #649--

Yeah
.  
Okay
.  So that reflects what I thought at the
time.  However, there was then an
 
agreement reached with
the -- I think with the Haemophilia Society as to what
the level of compensation should be, I think that's what
happened.  But I was not involved in that
, 
except
indicating
, 
as I have done, what I thought the policy
should be.  So that was a step forward.

--Result #650--

Err ... I didn't -- 
yes,
 I think it was but I thought it
was my job as a minister to communicate what I felt
about it, and I didn't -- I wasn't aware of any
pushback.  There was a
 -- 
well,
 there was 
the 
practical
issues of how do you persuade the Treasury and those
colleagues who were worried about precedents to go as
far as I and others would have wanted?  And you weren't
going to achieve that by making an
 
argument 
that
 was not
sustainable
, 
and which did not recognise that there were
financial pressures at that time.  But to my mind, in --
at that time and subsequently, too much of the argument
about who should be included 
and
 
what the level of
compensation should be
 
was looking at the cost rather
than the impact on the individuals concerned
.

--Result #651--

  
Can we go, please, to SCGV0000231_017.
This is your response
, 
as communicated by
 
86
David Binnie, your private secretary, to the minute
Mr Tucker 
sent
.  We can see 
that
 cop
ied
 to the -- 
sent
to the private secretary of the Secretary of State and
copied to others.  It says:
"Mr Forsyth has seen Mr Tucker's minute of
15 January 1991 to you and would like to record that he
is content with reactions suggested by Mr Tucker
.
"Mr Forsyth is however concerned that compensation
does not apply to others who have been infected by HIV
through deficient blood products but who are not
haemophiliacs, eg people suffering from leukaemia who
have received transfusions."
Just so that we are clear on the meaning of that
second paragraph, the concern that you are expressing
there is that, in your view, the level of compensation
or ex gratia payments should be extended to those
infected through blood transfusions and suchlike and not
that you are concerned that it would be?

--Result #652--

Yeah,
 I mean
, 
the struggle continued.  
We'd
 made some
progress, but an attempt was being made to form
 
87
a distinction
 of -- 
not just for 
the 
people 
who'd
 
had
leukaemia but anybody 
who'd
 had a transfusion or
a transplant or anything of that kind.  I could not
understand how it was possible to argue -- perhaps
"
compensation
"
 was the wrong word
, 
perhaps it was
a payment, an ex gratia payment -- how it was possible
to argue to exclude them other than on the grounds that
you wanted to save the cost.

--Result #653--

By the way, when I'm talking about the 
"
battle
"
, I'm not
referring to me
 -- 
I was just a junior minister
 -- 
but
to the outside campaigns which were going on, which were
very effective
 
and
, 
as far as I was concerned
, 
welcome
.
And
, 
informally, you know, I had some contact with some
of the MPs who put down Early 
Day 
Motions in Parliament
,
and so on.  I think this is 1991.  I'm not sure on the
timetable but, you know, there was a great deal of
public concern about the extent to which compensation or
payments were limited both as to value and as to extent
.

--Result #654--

  
I think what you've been asked about,
just to be
 
clear, and Mr Hill will correct me if I'm
wrong, is two separate issues where the Government may
have changed -- did change its approach.
The first in respect of settling the litigation in
England
, 
which had implications, obviously, for ongoing
litigation in Scotland.  The second is the question of
extending the Macfarlane Trust type of compensation to
those who did not have haemophilia but were infected
because of their treatment otherwise through the NHS.

--Result #655--

Let's go to a minute which is from the 24 July 1991
, 
so
nearly 
two
 years later
, 
which is the minute which
emerges at the end of the discussions within the
Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood at
a
 
time when the decision to introduce hepatitis C
testing is being put to ministers
 and 
being put
specifically to you.  Could we have PRSE0004608.  We can
see that this is 
sent
 to you, copied to the Secretary of
State, other ministers, and the Permanent Secretary of
the 
Home and 
Health Department.  It is again from
Mr Tucker.
If we look at paragraph 1
, 
it says:
"This minute is to inform the Minister 
of
 
108
a decision by the other UK Health Departments to approve
routine testing of blood donations for the antibody to
Hepatitis C virus/HCV from 1
 
September 1991 and
recommends that similar testing in Scotland should be
introduced from that date."
There is then a section on the case for screening
and the case against screening.  The Inquiry has already
looked
 
at -- there have been arguments that are being
made there in the context of Baroness Hooper's evidence,
and I won't take you through that.
If we look to page 2, we can see that
an
 
element -- some information is given on the
background.  Paragraph 3 states:
"The Hepatitis C virus is considered to be the
main
, though
 not only the cause of Non-A
 and
Non-B hepatitis which is most common form of post
transfusion hepatitis 
today
.  The disease may have run
a symptomless course but in some cases it can result in
chronic liver damage which may ultimately be fatal.
There is also a rare but serious acute form of 
illness
."
Paragraph 4 refers to the availability of
screening -- 
or the development of 
screening tests from
mid-1989, the early tests were said to produce many
false positives
 
and 
for 
some time there was 
no
supplementary test to indicate whether 
the positive
 

20 July 2022
          
          

  109
cases 
were 
in
fective
.
Paragraph 5:
"Despite this, routine testing for HCV antibodies
from all donated blood has been introduced recently 
in
[
the United States
]
, Japan, three Scandinavian countries
and a number of European countries.  The UK were advised
by experts not to introduce screening until the
available tests had been evaluated.  Supplementary tests
ha
ve 
proved satisfactory
 
and appropriate arrangements
for positive donors were in place.
"
There's then reference to a second generation test
that had been developed by two US manufacturers.  
It
states at the end of paragraph 6:
"Department of Health 
have agreed that the
arrangements for supplementing tests and counselling of
infectious donors should be introduced from
1 September 1991
.
"
Scottish position
"The SNBTS have been in favour of introducing the
test for Hepatitis C for some time now but on the basis
that a reliable testing kit can be supplied.  In
anticipation that testing would be introduced in 1991/92
a PES bid was lodged and this was successful.  SNBTS are
in a position to commence testing from the same date of
1
 
September as the rest of the UK.  The cost
s
 for
 
110
1991/92 will be in the region of £700,000 and as
indicated above this has already been included in the
CSA allocation
.
"
Recommendation
"As Department of Health Ministers have already
agreed to the screening for Hepatitis C, there would be
criticism if Scotland were not seen to be taking similar
action.  The testing kit now available is considered by
medical experts to be sufficiently sophisticated to give
accurate results and we recommend that the SNBTS should
be authorised to begin testing from 1 September 1991.
"
No
 specific publicity is being given by the
Department of Health Ministers to the introduction of
tests in England and Wales.  This is probably in view of
the current sensitivity surrounding blood transfusions
and HIV and the need to avoid giving an
 
opportunity for
further criticism that testing should have been
introduced earlier.  It is considered that
an
 
announcement may prompt questions about blood safety
and that it would give rise to another pressure group
seeking compensation for contracting Hepatitis C.  If
however the Minister considers that the balance of
advantage lies in assuring the public that all possible
steps are being taken in accordance with specific and
medical knowledge current available
, 
to ensure the
 
111
efficacy of blood and blood products, we shall prepare
a Press Release to this effect for the Minister's
approval."
That is Mr Tucker's minute of 24 July 1991.
If we could just turn back to the first page and
the first paragraph.  The minute doesn't contain any
information about when the Department of Health
ministers took the decision but the Inquiry knows from
other material made available 
to
 
it
 that a submission
was made to Baroness Hooper in the Department of Health
on 21 December 1990, so some seven
 months 
before this
minute
, 
and that Baroness Hooper indicated her approval
of the introduction of hepatitis C tests on
17 January 1991.
Does it surprise you, that you weren't being asked
for your view on this matter until 24 July 1991?

--Result #656--

To be fair to the Department of Health
, 
this is
Mr Tucker's speculation on what the reasons are
:
"
This 
is probably in view of the current
sensitivity surrounding blood transfusions and HIV and
the need to avoid giving an opportunity for further
criticism that testing should have been introduced
earlier.  It is considered that an announcement may
prompt questions about blood safety and that it would
give rise to another pressure group seeking compensation
for contracting 
Hepatitis C."
Now I did not like
 -- 
if that was their position,
I didn't agree with it.  We had a perfectly 
good
argument for why testing was not introduced earlier, and
 

20 July 2022
          
          

  121
I considered that by not keeping people informed about
what we were doing about blood safety we were more
likely to create questions about our commitment to that
.
And the issue of another pressure group seeking
compensation for contracting hepatitis C, there was
either a case for that or there wasn't.  And making an
announcement of this kind, which, as he points out,
is
 
where the balance of advantage lay, seemed to me to
be about reassuring people that we were doing everything
that 
we could to ensure that blood and blood products
were as safe as we could make them, and that we were
operating in a transparent manner
.
It's a good rule if you're a minister, if there's
an
 
argument about disclosure and non-disclosure, you
should always go for disclosure because
, 
if you don't go
for disclosure, people will then assume that there was
some hidden agenda.

--Result #657--

No
, I don't.  I don't recall that, and it was -- at what
stage
 -- 
when do you think that might have happened?
Because as far as I was concerned
, 
for most of the time
I was there, there was still unfinished business on the
issue of who was entitled to receive compensation or an
ex gratia payment
.

--Result #658--

Well, 
of course I was aware of it.  It's absolutely
obvious that the Scottish Office did not have the
resources of the Department of Health, which is a huge
department with a large number of people
, 
and also
,
 of
course
,
 was more affected by any decisions that were
taken on compensation or any other matters because of
its
 scale.  And it would have been foolish to try to
replicate in the Scottish Office -- and 
un
affordable
-- and if you'd done it
, 
it would be at the expense of
patient care -- to replicate the resources which the
Department of Health had
.  
Which is why it was so
important that 
the 
departments operated in
a collaborative manner, and kept each other informed and
considered the circumstances that occurred in different
parts of the United Kingdom.

--Result #659--

Only th
at 
I haven't seen this before -- until it was
supplied in the papers
.  
This 
was
 written from my
office.  
One is that 
I'm not quite sure what Sammy means
on this
, "
Secretary of State will need advice on all
this", which is 
fine
, "
and
 
the
 need to convince Scotland
to be as minimalist 
as
 possible
".  
I think Sammy is
asking the officials to give me advice of the need to
convince Scotland.  I'm not sure it was ever given to me
and it certainly doesn't reflect my view.
And Scotland anyway, by this time, had their own
scheme
, 
and the idea that I was going to be phoning them
up saying, you know
, "
This is the Department of Health
in England, I'm Secretary of State, you can't do this or
that
", 
I don't know if Sammy understood devolution but
 

21 July 2022
          
          

  33
it doesn't work that way, not in my book
, 
anyway
.  
You
have a discussion with colleagues, and we had a very
cooperative
 
discussion over the coming months, as you
can see from the papers, and
, 
basically
, we accepted for
reasons of speed
 -- 
because it was, you know, 20 years
overdue
 -- 
to give financial compensation
; 
reasons of
coherence that we thought that the same system should
apply to everyone in the UK
; 
simplicity
, 
we basically
accepted the Scottish scheme
, 
far less -- you know, far
from going to them and trying to convince them one way
or the other
.
Because if we'd have brought in a scheme that was
more generous than the Scots, 
well,
 we couldn't afford
it anyway, but if -- had we done
, 
it would have brought
about a fraction of the cohesion of the United Kingdom.
But I don't know, I mean
, 
I can't recall.  It may 
well
be that
, 
at some stage
, 
somebody 
sent
 something from
their office to Malcolm saying, "be as minimalist as
possible".  My recollection is 
that
, 
from the start
,
I
 -- 
to the best of my recollection
, 
from the start
I thought the Scots have got a template, it means it's
simpler, speedier, 
more 
cohesive, let's go on the
Scottish version
.

--Result #660--

Then if we just pick it up at DHSC0042275_005, we can
see this is from
 -- 
it looks like the Private Office of
Andrew Smith to your Private Office and those of
Alistair Darling and Paul Boateng
, 
and if we go further
down the page, we can see it records in the first
paragraph:
"Our Ministers met 
today
 to discuss compensation
schemes for sufferers 
of 
Hepatitis C.  They agreed the
following:
"The 
UK Government will introduce a scheme for
Hepatitis C sufferers in England.
"This is 
a 
devolved matter in Scotland (and almost
certainly in Wales and Northern Ireland also --
Sammy Sinclair to check this) and so it is for the
devolved administrations to make their own decisions on
this issue
.
"This decision should be communicated to the
 
35
devolved administrations by John Reid personally when
further issues have been worked through."
Then
, 
if we go over the page
, 
paragraph 3 records:
"It was stressed that it will be important for
department
s
 to work closely with the devolved
administrations 
once
 Ministers have communicated their
decision to them.  Department of Health will take the
overall lead in developing the policy along with the
devolved administrations."
So this would appear to be
, 
essentially
, 
the
formal cross-government confirmation, you having met
with ministerial colleagues in the UK Government, that
what you decided you wanted to do was essentially
endorsed by your colleagues
?

--Result #661--

Then if we pick matters up at DHSC5094083, this is
Mr Gutowski to you and also to Mr Darling, Mr Smith and
Mr Boateng, 1 July, and it's a submission relating to
various issues.  We can see there was a question about
whether this was a devolved issue in relation to Wales
,
which was ultimately resolved following legal advice
.  
If we go down to the bottom of the page, the
understanding at paragraph 5 was that the position in
Northern Ireland was essentially the same as Scotland
that it was a matter for Northern Ireland to decide.
If we go over the page, there was a discussion
about options for setting up the scheme.  We see the
three options set out in paragraph 6
, 
I'm not going to
read through those.
Then if we get to the third page, please,
Lawrence, bottom of the page
, 
under the heading
"Financial Implications", paragraph 16 onwards deals
with some of the issues relating to costing.  So
paragraph 16:
"The scheme the Scottish Executive is considering
would cost up to 
£
210 
[
million
]
 if a similar scheme were
implemented in England which is the basis upon which we
are working.  This is a worst case and assumes 
that
 all
 

21 July 2022
          
          

  37
those infected are identified and make a claim."
Then:
"If only 50% of the 5,000 unidentified people 
...
make a claim
 the 
costs are likely to be in the order of
£
140 
[
million
]
.
"
If the payments detailed in the Scottish Expert
Group proposals were accepted then the costs would be up
to 
£
600 
[
million
]
."
I'll come back to that, Lord Reid.
Paragraph 17 records the Scottish Executive
proposed payments, the 20,000 and then the 25,000
, 
which
I'm going to refer to as stage
 1
 and stage
 2
 payments.
Then if we go over the page, there's further
discussion in relation to that.  Then if we can pick it
up at paragraph 21, we can see it records:
"The proposed scheme makes 
no
 provision for making
payments to the dependants of people with Hepatitis C
who have since died.  The scheme proposed by the
Scottish Expert Group did propose payments for
dependants 
and it is
 possible we will come under
pressure to extend the scheme in such a way
.  This would
increase the costs substantially.  
It is
 also possible
that 
we
 will come under pressure to increase the value
of the scheme towards that proposed by the Scottish
Experts Group
.  
Again
, 
this could increase costs
 
38
significantly."
I'll come back again to those issues a little
later.  Then funding the scheme, paragraph 22:
"As the Law Officers have ruled this is a health
issue
, 
the costs of the scheme in England would need to
be borne by the Department of Health
.  
"
The Treasury have said that 
no
 additional funding
would be available for a hepatitis C compensation
scheme."
Then if we go to the next page, just the
"
Conclusion
", 
paragraph 28:
"At your meeting on 25 June it was decided that
once
 further issues had been worked up then
 
John Reid
would communicate the decision that the Government would
introduce a compensation scheme in England to the
Devolved Administrations
.
"
I'll come back to some of the issues raised by
that as we look through some of the later decisions
 
but
,
in broad terms, is this right: that the decision in
principle having been taken at that meeting on 25 June
,
the advice that you then receive is already looking at,
perhaps for the reasons you've already given, the
Scottish model as recently announced, as the likely
framework for what England would do?

--Result #662--

Yes
.  Um, I mean
, 
I've asked myself
: 
why did I do this
by press release and not by Parliamentary statement?
And I think the answer to that is probably the date of
it, 29 August.  Parliament wasn't sitting and
,
therefore
, 
we had to put out a press release which kind
of announced it
, 
rather than the traditional method of
doing a ministerial statement
, 
and so on.
Why couldn't we have waited until Parliament came
 
43
back?  Because the timetable was sort of dictated by
Malcolm Chisholm's requirement to appear before
a Scottish committee.  So that's why it was in a press
release
.
The press release would have gone through various
iterations, people would have had the word
"compensation" in it and somebody would have objected.
You know, you can't say 
"
compensation
"
 because that
sounds as though there's legal liability, and so on.
But I would ultimately have approved it
.  
And
, 
I mean
,
basically
, 
I think it encapsulates in a few words the
decision that we had taken.  I don't think it's
inaccurate, and I certainly would have approved this
.

--Result #663--

Now in terms of Treasury involvement, if we could pick
matters up at DHSC0014997_116, this is a letter from the
Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Paul Boateng,
27
 August 2003 to you.  It says:
"
1.  I am 
writing following our conversation of
earlier 
today
 about your proposed announcement tomorrow
of an ex
-
gratia scheme for victims of Hepatitis C in
 
46
England infected as a result of treatment with NHS blood
or blood products.
"2.  
I have real reservations about this course of
action
, 
as I have made clear
, 
but 
well
 understand the
pressures upon the government in England and 
Wales
 to
which you referred.  The risks
,
 however
, 
are real and
the precedent for other cases where there is 
no
 formal
liability
 profoundly
 
unhelpful.
"3.  
I am
,
 however
,
 reluctantly prepared to agree
to you making an announcement tomorrow
, 
subject to the
following conditions:
"- 
agree to meet 
the
 full costs of the scheme from
your current settlement
, 
and that you agree not to make
a claim on the reserve to meet these costs or seeking
additional funds to cover them in the forthcoming
Spending Review
;
"- 
that you discuss your proposal with Wales and
Northern Ireland and
, 
on the assumption that policy
responsibility is 
also devolved
 (
or the responsibility
of the 
[
Northern Ireland Office
]
 during the suspension
of the NIE
), 
reach agreement with them 
as appropriate
concerning any announcement of their introducing similar
arrangements for Hepatitis C sufferers.  This must also
be on the understanding that 
no
 reserve claim or bid for
additional resources in Spending Review is to be made
 
47
for these costs either.  If in the case of Wales legal
advice subsequently confirms that the policy is
reserved, 
and that there is therefore an issue about who
should bear the costs
, 
you must reach agreement with
them as appropriate about how the costs are to be met
or
, 
failing that, agree to cover all such costs
yourself
;
"- 
that you further agree, and secure a similar
agreement with the devolved administrations, that the
Department of Health 
and devolved administrations will
meet in full any future costs incurred should there be
a legal obligation put in place comparable payment
arrangements arising from any compensation awarded as
a direct result of the precedent set by establishment of
this
 scheme
.
"
4.  
In handling this announcement it will be
vital to minimise the risk of setting a damaging
precedent for other areas.  You will want, therefore, to
make it clear that this is a unique case whose special
characteristics justify the solution 
[proposed]
.  You
will, I know, also wish to be proactive in your
presentation strategy to ensure this message gets
across."
First of all, do you have any recollection of your
discussions with Paul Boateng in this issue now?
 
48

--Result #664--

Just to complete the documentary picture, there's
a response from 
a 
financial official within the
Department to Mr Boateng's letter, a response addressed
to you, at DHSC0004421_079.
It's dated 28 August 2003, so 
it's 
the day, I
think, after the Chief Secretary's letter and the day
before the press announcement
, 
and it refers in the
first paragraph to the Chief Secretary's letter
, 
then
says at paragraph 2:
"
I am
 content that the costs and risks are
manageable and
, 
in
 particular
, 
this scheme does not
create a precedent that will create liability for
similar
, 
future claims."
Paragraph 3 explains that:
"
We
 will be able to absorb the costs of the
proposed scheme within current DH budgets."
Then 4 and 5
 
deal
 
with the issue of the timing of
the announcement and which year's budgets
, 
which I won't
go over.
Then under the heading "Creating a precedent
",
 
54
Mr Campbell, the author of this minute, says:
"I do not believe that setting up a compensation
scheme for Hepatitis C sufferers will create a precedent
for future campaigns on similar issues for two reasons
.  
"
The payments we will be making will be ex gratia
and therefore we will not be admitting any liability
.  
"
Secondly
, 
we have already set up 
two 
similar
schemes 
(
the Macmillan and Eileen Trusts
)
 to 
compensate
patients who contracted HIV through infected blood
products
 which created 
no
 precedent."
Did it 
occur 
to you to perhaps go back to the
Treasury, whether at this stage or at some point in the
future, with this assurance from within your own
Department that it didn't have the precedent setting
risks that Mr Boateng had been worried about, and to see
whether you could get perhaps a more responsive attitude
from the Treasury?

--Result #665--

  
Hepatitis C, as opposed to the
question of compensation payments and the way they're
being administered?

--Result #666--

I'm going to ask you to look at two documents with me
which you've been given over lunch, so they are not
 
114
documents that have been provided to you before.
The first is WITN1056057
.  
This is a letter dated
2
 
September 2003 from Mrs Colette Wintle who is herself
someone who was infected and
, 
by this time
, 
was also
an
 
active campaigner.  It is addressed to you.  It
expresses concern about the level of compensation that
had been announced
, 
and then it also, if we go just to
the second page, 
in
 
the
 third and fourth paragraph,
refers to the quest for a public inquiry
, 
sets out
various matters in relation to that, and then in the
penultimate paragraph says:
"
... 
we would like the opportunity" -- 
sorry, 
this
is the last sentence of the penultimate paragraph:
"
... 
we would like the opportunity to show you
documents that fully support the need for a public
inquiry and a
 
proper compensation package
.
"
Before I ask you about it
, 
I want to show you the
reply and then I'll ask you.  If we go to WITN1056
0
60,
this is a letter from a Mr David Reay in the Blood
Policy Team.  It's dated 9 October 2003.  It refers in
the first paragraph to Mrs Wintle's letter to you, it
says:
"The Secretary of State has asked me to reply.
I apologise for the delay in doing so."
Then
, 
on the issue of a public inquiry, if we look
 
115
at the penultimate paragraph
, 
it says:
"You have requested a meeting with the Secretary
of State to 
discuss a public inquiry into this issue.
However, the Government does not accept that any
wrongful
 practices were employed and does not consider
that a public inquiry is justified."
Then there's that same sentence about donor
screening that we 
saw
 in 
your letter
 to Andy
 Kerr, 
and
then it says:
"The Secretary of State does not therefore 
feel
that a 
meeting 
is appropriate."
Lord Reid
, 
my understanding from looking at the
documents and other files is that Mrs Wintle's letter
went through what I understand is called the
 "
treat
official
" 
route
 
and was dealt with by officials, and
answered
 in the way we see here from David Reay.  Does
it follow from that that you are unlikely to have seen
Mrs Wintle's letter yourself?

--Result #667--

Well, 
yes,
 it was a different scheme and I think the
phrase I used is that
 
I would like to have approximated
towards the treatment of HIV
.  
It wouldn't have been
identical
 
because there was differences between the
nature of the HIV infection and the hepatitis C
infection.  This is a point that was made in order to
maintain the pre-existing refusal to have a financial
assistance scheme.
Now
, 
I've never denied that there were differences
between them but
, 
in my view
, 
the differences between
those two infections did not justify the payment of --
I mustn't use the word 
"
compensation
"
 -- the payment of
financial assistance to HIV while not doing it to those
who
 suffered hepatitis C.
So the scheme, even if we'd had enough money,
wouldn't have been identical to the HIV scheme but would
approximate
 
more towards it.  Because of the
affordability issues, it felt far short of that on
,
 
for
instance,
 
the dependants
 and the discretionary element
.
 
124

--Result #668--

I'm going to turn now to the calls for a hepatitis C
payment scheme, and I'm going to start with the report
that The Haemophilia Society presented to you from the
Hepatitis C Working Party.  But before we do that, I'm
just going to look at the briefing that you had for the
meeting with them on 12 June
, 
shortly after they'd
presented the report.  That's at DHSC0041305_037.
Here we have a briefing to you
, 
dated 10 June 2002
about a meeting with The Haemophilia Society and
Michael Connarty on 12
 
June and we can see from the
first paragraph that The Haemophilia Society had asked
to meet with you and to present their report from the
hepatitis C working party and that the 
report
 is being
provided to you
 -- 
and we'll have a look at it in
a moment
 -- 
and sets out briefly what the report
contains
: 
costed proposals for a financial assistant
fund for haemophiliacs who were affected with
hepatitis C through NHS infected blood
.
 
148
Then we can see at paragraph
 3
 that
, 
while the
report was received on 31 May
: 
"... 
it 
has not
 been possible for officials to
analyse it in any depth
, 
and the Society are aware of
that
."  
So that's the context in which the meeting is take
place.
Then if we go over the page, we can see that
you're given some advice on developments in Scotland
,
which we don't need to deal with now, and then handling
options, you're given two options: to adhere to the line
that compensation is not payable to haemophiliacs
infected with hepatitis C or to agree to consider the
report and respond to the Society in writing
.
So that's the briefing note.  Then if we look at
the report
, 
we can find that at HSOC0005927.  If we go,
please, to page 2, which is the 
"
Executive Summary
", 
we
can see how the working party was set up by The
Haemophilia Society in September 2001, and comp
r
ises
a QC specialising in medical negligence, consultant
actuary, several specialist haemophilia doctors with
particular expertise in the treatment of hepatitis 
and
the
 Chief Executive Officer of the Haemophilia Society
.
Then in paragraph 2:
"The 
... 
Working Party was asked by the Society to
 

21 July 2022
          
          

  149
devise costed proposals for a financial assistance fund
to recognise the loss and suffering of people with
haemophilia resulting from their infection with
hepatitis C."
Then if we go down to paragraph
 4
, we can see
that
: 
"
The brief 
for 
the working 
group
 
was
 to develop
proposals for a scheme which would provide financial
assistance on the basis of medical need, and which would
be relatively simple and swift to administer
."
It says there that the working group looked
 
at
number of different schemes operating around the world
and decided that the Canadian HCV Compensation Scheme
provided the most suitable model and this 
was
 therefore
used 
as
 the basis for their proposals.
Then if we go over the page to page 3, we can see
some explanation about the model of payments that they
are recommending
, 
paragraph 8:
"
... 
be 
made 
according
 to the stage the liver
disease has reached with a 
range 
of formulae being used
to calculate the amount of 
award.  This will allow the
payments to broadly reflect individual circumstances and
to be allocated via an 
administrative system rather than
possibly a more
, 
time
-
consuming and costly system of
individual tribunals."
 
150
Then paragraph 9 makes the point that there is
allowance for dependants and families
, 
for loss of
earnings, for 
in
convenience of drug therapy
, 
et cetera.
Then the estimated average cost of the scheme is
set the out at paragraph 10
: 
over a 10-year period,
52.26 million per year
.  
Then makes the point that
that is a movable feast depending on what is or isn't
included in the scheme.
Then paragraph 12 makes the point that the
calculations have been made on a pessimistic basis, and
that they hope that
, 
with improved treatments, there
will be an improved quality of life for those infected
that would have a knock-on reduction in the cost of the
scheme.
So if we then carry on looking through the report,
we can see at page 4, paragraph 2, the remit.  The large
paragraph there:
"In particular, the object of any scheme should be
to recompense those who contracted hepatitis C prior to
1st March 1990.  They, because they had contracted
hepatitis C from infected blood products prior to that
date, are not eligible to be compensated under the
provisions of the Consumer Protection Act ... and the
Product Liability Directive ... Some, but not all, were
parties to the HIV litigation which was compromised in
 
151
1990 when the Macfarlane Trust was used as a vehicle to
provide financial assistance to people with haemophilia
and HIV.  At that time those who were parties to the
litigation in England (but not in Scotland) waived their
rights to seek damages in respect of any of the
hepatitis viruses even though the litigation was not
concerned with such viruses."
So just pausing there
, 
the point that's being made
here by The Haemophilia Society, is that, is this right,
there are some of those infected by hepatitis C who have
no
 other ability to obtain damages for the loss that
they've suffered as a result of their medical treatment?

--Result #669--

Then if we just complete looking through the report, we
can see the levels of payment that they're suggesting at
page 10.  At the bottom, at paragraph 25
, third
sentence:
"
We recommend that payment be determined by the
level of injury at the time that compensation is
determined.  Subsequently
, 
if the compensated person
moves on to another level
 
they ought to be able to
return and seek assistance appropriate at that level
.
"
And then
 
credit would be given for payments
previously received.
Then if we go over the page we can see how that
 
is
worked through.  We can see level
 
1, that that
 
is the
model of those who are antibody positive for HCV, who
have not progressed to a
 
higher level stage of the
illness would get £7,500.  Payment level
 
2, and
that is -- 
we
 don't need to turn it up, but it's at
 

21 July 2022
          
          

  153
page 10 of the report
, 
it's those that are HCV antibody
test positive, HCV PCR test positive would get £10,000.
Payment at level 3, those whose liver shows
fibrous changes
 -- 
we get this from page 10
, 
the
definition of stage
 
3.  Those whose liver shows fibrous
changes 
or who 
have received drug therapy or meet the
criteria for such therapy will get £10,000
.  
Paragraph 30
, 
payment at level 4 is
 
set at
£40,000
, 
that's clinical proof of liver cirrhosis
.  
Then payment at level 5, it's at £60,000,
decompensation of the liver or liver cancer.
So -- and then if we look through to page 25 and
26, we can see that
, 
on top of 
those
 payments for
general damages, as it's called in the report, echoing
common law, we can see that the report is also
suggesting that there should be compensation for 
loss 
of
earnings
, 
we can see that at paragraph 3
.  
If we go down the page, compensation for exposure
to drug therapy
; 
paragraph 6, compensation for costs of
care
; 
over the page, compensation for out
-
of
-
pocket
expenses, et cetera
; 
and for the deceased prior to
1
 
January 2002
, 
for dependants
, 
and so on.  So different
categories of compensation have been set out and worked
through in that report
.
Then just completing the material that was being
 
154
provided to you before I ask you any questions, 
we
 can
see the briefing on the lines to take for the meeting
with The Haemophilia Society on 12 June.  We can see
that at DHSC0041305_038.
Again, just to put that in context and to remind
ourselves of the date, this is a document that you would
have received a few weeks into your new role as
Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Public Health, and
you're here being given the current lines to take on
compensation
:
"This Government and its predecessor have held
that compensation is only paid to patients when the NHS
has been at fault and that an
 
exception to this 
rule 
is
not justified in the case of haemophiliacs infected with
hepatitis C
.
"
We
 deeply regret that so many people 
with
haemophilia 
were infected with hepatitis C through blood
products.  But the fact is that as soon as technology
became available to make blood products free from
hepatitis C the NHS introduced it.  There is therefore
no
 justification for compensation based on legal
liability for people with haemophilia and hepatitis C."
Then a
 
little bit further on down the -- we can
see compensation schemes in other countries.  You're
given some information about schemes in Canada and
 
155
Ireland
: 
"
Canada and Ireland set up schemes because
patients in both countries were being infected with HCV
after it became possible to remove the hepatitis C virus
from blood products.  We understand that the Canadian
scheme is limited to those people infected with HCV
after 1987
 (
in England
, 
action was taken to virally
inactivate blood products 
in 
1985
)
."
Would you have understood from that paragraph that
after 1985 there wouldn't have been infection from blood
products in England?

--Result #670--

  
Can we turn over to page 2 of this annex and see
what's said there about
 "
Hepatitis C compensation in the
Irish Republic
"
.  The first paragraph deals with the
contaminate
d
 anti-D immunoglobulin produced by the Irish
National 
Blood
 
Service and, 
the point is made there,
that's unique to the Irish Republic
.
Then it
 
said 
this
:
"The Irish Government set up their hepatitis C
compensation schemes following evidence of negligence by
the Irish Blood Service.  Compensation is therefore
being given in very specific circumstances which do not
apply in the UK.  It does not create any precedent for
us."
Again 
pausing
 there, did you understand from this
that what was being said about the Irish Government
scheme was that it was set up as a consequence of
evidence of negligence, and so that was why it was
different to the scheme -- to what was happening in
the
 
UK?
 
160

--Result #671--

And other witnesses have been asked about the veracity
or the accuracy of that state
ment, 
and I'm not going to
deal with that with you, but other evidence has been
given about whether or not that statement is in fact
accurate.
Then if we move down to what you're told about
the
 
hepatitis C litigation and the judgment of
Mr Justice
 
Burton
 
which was handed down on
26
 March 2001
.  
We can see the background is set out in that first
paragraph.  In the second paragraph you're told
:
"
An 
out of court
 statement was accepted by those
claimants infected with hepatitis C after 1
 
April 1991
,
roughly the point at which the more reliable second
generation screening test became commercially available.
This settlement was offered 
because, 
with the benefit of
hindsight, NBA recognised that routine screening for
hepatitis C might have been introduced slightly earlier,
then you're told that Mr Just
ice
 Burton found in favour
of the claimants and that that has been used by
Lord Morris of the Haemophilia Society, to press their
case for compensation
.
Again
, 
just pausing there, reading that, did 
that
 

21 July 2022
          
          

  161
give you 
cause
 to question, perhaps, the line you're
being told that there is 
no
 evidence of negligence or 
no
evidence of 
fault
 on the part of Government
, 
when you've
got out of court out-of-court statements being made
because
, 
perhaps with the benefit of hindsight
, 
routine
screening for hepatitis C might have been introduced
earlier?

--Result #672--

  
Then if we look on down the page we can see
"
Compensation
 -- 
vCJD
"
:
"The Government is making 
£1 million available to
fund care packages centrally 
and is strength
ening 
the
 

21 July 2022
          
          

  165
support for the National CJD Surveillance Unit
 ...
"
Then if we go over the page, we can see:
"This does not change the longstanding policy in
this country that compensation or other financial help
to patients is only paid when the NHS or individuals
working in it are at fault.  We are 
not
 talking about
no-fault compensation but ex gratia payments for a group
of people who
 
because of exceptional circumstances, have
endured and are enduring a particularly harrowing
ordeal"
.
Again
, 
just pausing there, was it your
understanding that that's what was being sought on
behalf of those that were suffering from hepatitis C, an
ex gratia payment rather than compensation?

--Result #673--

I suppose so.  I'm not an expert in damages
.  
But for
me, when you start to talk about damages and
compensation
 -- 
I think you corrected yourself earlier
talking about recompense rather than a financial
assistance scheme.  I think those two things are quite
different.  As soon as you start talking about
compensation, then you're looked at fault and blame
.
Whereas if you talk about financial assistance, it is by
its nature discretionary and ex gratia.  And I think
those two things are very different.
 
167

--Result #674--

Not in as stark terms as you put it there, but I think
that the whole basis was about compensation
.  
And I'm
sure we'll come later to the issue of fault and no fault
and the position that was developing, but I think
the
 
fact that it mirrored a compensation scheme where
there was fault is 
actually
 an important issue.

--Result #675--

Then just finishing off here, then
, 
we've got
"
Compensation 
- 
Haemophiliacs and HIV
":
"The special payment scheme for 
those
 infected
with
 
HIV was introduced in 1988.  At that time there
were very strong public attitudes to HIV 
-- 
of stigma
,
and widespread fear of a new and untreatable fatal
infection which was sexually transmitted.  The payment
scheme
 (
The Macfarlane Trust
) 
has continued since then.
"
The same circumstances do not apply to
hepatitis C.  We accept that those infected in this way
do face difficulties
, 
as do other NHS patients and
groups of people who unfortunately suffered unforeseen
harm which could not have been avoided.  We aim to
 
168
support those with haemophilia infect
ed
 with hepatitis C
through the benefits system where appropriate, and
through a number of projects which we support through
The Haemophilia Society
.
"
So it's right, is it
, 
here to understand that
what's being said is that HIV is different to
hepatitis C and that's a justification for having
a compensation scheme for those that were infected with
HIV and not hepatitis C?

--Result #676--

It's there saying:
"P
S(
P
H)
 [that's you] should be aware that 
an
expert group set up by Scottish Health Ministers
 will

others infected with hepatitis C through blood similar
to the HIV scheme established in the late 
'80s
.  
We have
not 
yet 
seen anything in writing but this would suggest
initial 
lump 
sum payments plus ongoing support for those
infected
, 
their 
widows 
and dependants."
Then if we could go down to the last paragraph
there.  In the last sentence
, 
it says:
 
170
"In the past, the understanding has been that any
policy changes on this issue would be taken on a UK
basis.  This position can 
no
 longer be guaranteed."
Now
, 
the Inquiry has heard evidence about this
understanding post-devolution
, 
that issues about
compensation schemes would be on a UK
-
wide basis.  Do
you know where that understanding comes from, and who
generated it?

--Result #677--

It's very difficult to answer the 'what if' questions
about if I had known then, you know, what I know now.
Those are difficult questions.  I may 
well
 have wanted
to delve further into what was being presented.  I may
well
 have wanted further information
 
if that was the
case.  But I think, as we come on to the other issues
that happened, there was a certain context around all of
this, around compensation and no fault and all of those
issues, that also had a bearing on the steps
that I
 
would take and the decisions that I would make
.
 
175

--Result #678--

Yes
, I want to come on and ask you about this.
If we then go over the page
, 
we can see the
Government position as expressed by you in relation to
those people, and that's the first full paragraph down
they're
, 
you are talking about the 
constituent
, I think,
of Mr 
Stringer
, who asked you -- to whom you're
responding
, 
and you say this
, 
at the second half of this
paragraph:
"The 
[
honourable
] Gentleman's
 
constituent is not
the only person in that position
 of whom we are aware
[
that position of somebody whose claim is time-barred
],
 
178
but it would set a most unfortunate precedent in other
litigation where there are 
'
time bars
'
 if the Government
were 
to accept that as a reason for
 
awarding financial
compensation, because it would be entirely outwith the
legal framework that applies to our decision making in
such matters.  I recognise how 
hard
 that seems to
individuals 
facing 
difficulties or family tragedies
, 
but
it is important that we maintain the integrity of the
system and the rules by which we are bound."
So is it right to understand from this that what
you were saying was that
, 
for those that had not issued
claims, who had been infected within the window of
1 March 1988 to 1 September 1991, who had not issued
claims, and were now time-barred, would not be paid
compensation by the Government because the Government
was relying on the time bar?

--Result #679--

Yes
, and I think it's right that this is a very, very
difficult situation, because people obviously have been
impacted by what has happened, but this is a time bar
and
, 
obviously
, 
this would be compensation without any
acknowledgement of fault, and that's been a core issue
around all of this, you know, tragic set of
circumstances
.  
And I say there in the debate
: 
"
I recognise how 
hard
 that seems to individuals
facing difficulties or family tragedies
, 
but 
it is
 
179
important that we maintain the integrity of the system
and the rules by which we are bound."
Now, you know, to some people listening to that,
that sounds 
hard
 hearted and insensitive.  I can assure
you that I was neither
 
and very, very conscious of the
impact that this was having on people's day-to-day
lives
.

--Result #680--

Can you recall at the time that this decision was being
reached that the Government would rely on the time bar,
can you recall whether there was any discussion about
whether or not there was a moral case that would mean
that the Government should not rely on the time bar and
should pay out for those people who, just by the fact
that they hadn't issued proceedings within the relevant
time, would now not be
 
getting compensation which they
would otherwise have been able to obtain?

--Result #681--

But would you accept that follow
ing 
the judgment of
Mr Justice Burton, the category of people who had
received life-threatening infections as a result of
blood or blood products was getting smaller and smaller
.
Those with 
HIV
 ex gratia
 
payment
s, 
those 
with vCJD
ex gratia payments, 
those that had been infected between
March 
'
88 and September 1991 if they brought proceedings
could get damages, and so the moral case is getting
stronger and stronger, isn't it, for
, 
instead of looking
at the differences, to look at the similarities and say:
well,
 these people are suffering in similar ways,
they've been infected by a similar route, we ought to
 

21 July 2022
          
          

  181
rethink this compensation policy?

--Result #682--

You've told us in your statement and again in your oral
evidence that this was an important issue that was
escalated to the Secretary of State and we've heard
evidence from Mr Milburn.  There's an email from
Charles Lister
 
which we don't need to go to but which
describes the Secretary of State's stance on
compensation as being unequivocally opposed 
to
 
it
.  Is
that your recollection of his stance?

--Result #683--

How does that work?  You have an HIV compensation -- 
you
have 
an HIV 
compensation 
or ex gratia scheme
, 
the
Macfarlane Trust, which is said not to have set
a precedent
, 
because if it had set a precedent then
there would be a scheme for those that had been infect
ed
with hepatitis C.  How then is it said
 -- 
or how does
one then get to the point where you say: but if we had
a hepatitis C scheme, then that would set a precedent
for all these other people that are being caused harm by
completely different forms of medical treatment?  Why
would it set a precedent if the Macfarlane Trust and the
HIV scheme didn't set a precedent?

--Result #684--

Well, as far as I recall, the thinking was that the 
more
circumstances in which compensation is paid, the weaker
becomes 
the position 
that compensation is not paid
unless there is negligence and fault, becomes 
very
difficult to hold, and I think there are various
statements from officials and indeed from discussions
between ministers that if you have a series of
exceptions to the general rule that there should be
 
183
fault, then it becomes almost a slippery slope to the
point where you have a no-fault compensation scheme.
Now, you know, there are merits of all kinds of
compensation schemes, and I am aware that John Hutton,
referred this issue initially to the clinical -- the
review of clinical negligence that Liam Donaldson was
carrying out, that Liam Donaldson in his report 
making
amends
 decide
d
 to reject that option.  It would have
cost the NHS an extra £4 billion
.  
But 
I'd
 say that that
report was 20
-
odd years ago and it may be that there is,
you know, room for a new discussion around that.  But at
the time that I was a minister, then that principle was
absolutely, you know, held to, not just by officials,
but by Secretary of State, by Minister of State, and was
really quite a fundamental line.

--Result #685--

And how, if at all, was the moral case for a hepatitis C
compensation scheme
, 
the inequality point that the Ross
Report noted, inequality between those that had HIV and
hepatitis C, how was that 
factored
 into those
discussions if at all?

--Result #686--

We also know that
, 
following that conversation, steps
were taken to get legal advice as to whether or not the
compensation scheme
, 
the ex gratia scheme
 
was a matter
that was devolved to Scotland or not, and 
did
 
you
 have
any role in that process of getting advice
?

--Result #687--

I don't think we need to go to it but
, 
as a
 
result
,
I think
, 
of this
, 
you get a briefing which goes through
the costings of the proposal from The Haemophilia
Society
, 
and that, for those 
that
 
are
 listening and for
the record is at DHSC5320619.  That submission appends
to it letters for you to consider
, 
sending to
The
 
Haemophilia
 
Society
, 
effectively turning down the
proposal and saying, "
No
 compensation scheme
"; 
is that
right?

--Result #688--

So is it right to understand that you were having sort
of 
high
 level conversations and discussions with more
senior ministers about whether there should be
a compensation scheme or an ex gratia scheme for those
with hepatitis on a sort of broader level, but 
that 
the
question of The Haemophilia Society report and their
 
192
proposal for that scheme was a matter for you to
consider and wasn't something that was escalated to more
senior ministers?

--Result #689--

Are you aware of any examples where individuals or
groups of individuals other than those infected blood
victims have used the Macfarlane Trust as a precedent to
get compensation without proving fault?

--Result #690--

Yes
, it's the precedent point.  Are you aware of the
Macfarlane Trust being used as a precedent
, 
as the
Department feared
, 
for getting compensation without
proving fault, other than 
by 
those that had been
infected by blood with hepatitis C
?

--Result #691--

No,
 I think there were two issues.  One was the
significant cost
, 
of £500 million, but the other issue
was around acknowledging compensation without fault.  So
I think that those two issues, taken together, were
quite important
.

--Result #692--

Did you ever discuss the issue of paying financial
support or compensation to those infected or affected
with Professor Ludlam
?

--Result #693--

The next paragraph then refers to the work of Dr Gillon,
and if we pick it up again in the fourth line:
"The advice which 
I have
 received from medical and
legal staff is that as such a look-back exercise is
practicable 
then 
the Secretary of State and I have
a duty to undertake the exercise as soon as possible."
Then there's a reference to the possibility of
liability.  Then it says this:
"
I am
 conscious that the matter of a look-back
policy for HCV was considered by the 
[
MSBT
]
 at their
recent meeting
 
and that they have advised that
procedures should be put in place to identify those at
risk
 
but 
'
whatever is done, should be done equally and
uniformly throughout the UK
'
."
That's a quote from the MSBT recommendations
:
"The Committee has also recommended that guidance
should be drawn up but this leaves unresolved the
question of the timing of the introduction and the
implementation of the look-back exercise.  The advice
 

25 July 2022
          
          

  81
which 
I have
 received from my medical and legal staff is
such that I consider 
it is
 
no
 longer a matter of policy
but of legal liability, and that the look-back should
take place as soon as possible in Scotland.  
I am
informed that the 
[
SNBTS
]
 is ready to carry out such
an
 
exercise and I have 
no
 alternative but to instruct
them to proceed.
"I appreciate that there are sensitivities in
proceeding in advance of the rest of the UK, but given
that it may be some time before all parts are ready,
I consider that I have little choice but to take this
forward in view of the 
position 
in Scotland.  
I 
shall
ensure you will be kept informed of 
the progress of 
this
exercise
 
since I recognise that this may have value as
a pilot for any similar exercise elsewhere in the UK
(although I would not, of course, wish our action to be
presented or seen as a pilot exercise)."
Then
 he says:
"I accept that any exercise may encourage any
further pressure for compensation for those infect
ed
 but
we shall 
continue 
to resist this robustly in line with
our general policy."
Then this:
"We shall not of course be publicising the
look-back exercise and shall do all 
we
 can to avoid
 
82
media interest
.  
If
, 
however
, 
direct questions are
asked, it would be difficult to avoid answering them."
Then he says he hopes that Mr Sackville will
understand the Scottish circumstances make it imperative
that action is taken now.
So two questions, Professor Keel.  The first
arises out of that paragraph about not publicising the
look-back exercise, avoiding media interest.  Do you
have any thoughts or observations about that paragraph,
given what might be said to be the advantages in Public
Health terms of them doing the opposite of what
Lord Fraser is here recommending?

--Result #694--

I'm going to pick the picture up, then, in 1995.  If we
look
, 
first of all
, 
at SCGV0000165_1646.
Now this is a letter dated 
25
 May 1995.  It's
addressed to Roger Scofield 
in
 the NHS Executive at the
Department of Health, and it's from Ian Snedden
 (
and we
can see from the first paragraph that he has replaced
George Tucker
)
 and Mr Snedden is responding to a letter
from Roger Scofield about proposals to institute
a payment scheme for those infected with hepatitis C
through blood and blood products
, 
and the letter says as
follows:
"
I have
 now had the opportunity to discuss the
proposals with the Department's medical and legal
advisers, and 
we
 are of the view that the scheme as it
is proposed would give rides to a number of complex
legal and medical questions.  I can advise you that the
consensus which emerged from these initial
considerations was that whilst the 
'
no
 compensation
'
position was becoming increasingly untenable, the
proposals to link payments to social needs and the
degree of harm suffered would be very difficult to
 
111
establish and the 
(
clinical
)
 judgments 
required
 would
also make it costly and complex to administer.
"
In the circumstances, I 
feel
 I am therefore
obliged
 to seek the views of our Ministers before we
respond substantively.  In particular, I am sure that
Lord Fraser, our Minister for Health and Home Affairs,
would wish to consider these 
proposals
 carefully given
his 
earlier involvement when he was formerly Lord
Advocate, with the 
HIV settlement scheme.
"We will try to obtain the views of Ministers as
quickly as 
possible
.  I 
hope
 the inevitable delay does
not cause too much difficulty in dealing with a subject
which I am aware is creating pressure on all UK Health
Departments.  I will, of course, inform you of our
Ministers views as soon as these are known."
So 
this letter suggests that there had been some
initial discussions 
within
 the Department, including the
Department's medical and legal advisers.  Is it likely,
given the subject matter of this, that that would have
included you?

--Result #695--

We've then got the heading "No-Fault Compensation
", 
and
it's said and underlined:
"
... 
establishing a no-fault compensation scheme
would be contrary to the position which the Government
has taken to date.  The Government has opposed no-fault
compensation for 
5 
reasons."
Now
, 
I'm not going to take you through each of
 
115
those reasons Professor, but if we can go over to the
top of the next page
, 
I just want to ask your view
,
first of all
, 
about what's said at (d).  It refers to
: 
"
Negligence in the health care field not
considered to be fundamentally different from negligence
in any other walk of life
, 
where claims for compensation
are re
solved through the courts
 ...
"
Then this:
"
... 
the present system arguably has a deterrent
effect on malpractice and no-fault compensation could
conceivably make doctors less careful."
As a doctor yourself and medical adviser to the
SHHD, was that a view which you shared?

--Result #696--

Well, insofar as I agreed it 
was
 a theoretical risk
 
but
,
I mean
, 
I didn't really 
feel
 that the introduction of
a no-fault compensation scheme would lead to my
colleagues casting all care to the winds and being
cavalier in their practice.  But it definitely was
a theoretical argument.

--Result #697--

Then below paragraph (e
), 
it says this:
"The main argument against compensation is that
the treatment offered was the best available in the
light of medical knowledge at the time."
Then there's reference to the issue about the
introduction of the test for hepatitis C and it being
 
116
introduced earlier in other countries.  Again, is that
your handwriting on the right-hand side, Professor Keel?

--Result #698--

Would you accept, however, reflecting on the kind of
issues that
 
I referred to in my question to you, that
generalising -- by making an
 
assertion as the main
argument against compensation that the treatment offered
was the best available in the light of medical knowledge
 

25 July 2022
          
          

  121
at the time, is an over-generalisation?

--Result #699--

To what extent in the 1990s 
when the 
Scottish Home and
Health Department was formulating or maintaining its
various policy positions
 -- 
here
, 
obviously
, 
the policy
 
123
position is in relation to compensation
 -- 
was
consideration given to the question of whether patients
had been treated with informed consent, whether they'd
been offered proper choices?

--Result #700--

Professor Keel, just to say I'm going to pick up on that
issue
 
and
,
 indeed
,
 what you've said earlier about the
issue relating to the Scottish 
heat
-
treated product
tomorrow, because the evidence you've given is not
necessarily reflected in the evidence the Inquiry has
heard on those issues.
Can I just go back to the briefing 
we
 were looking
at, SCGV0000
165
_
035, page
 5.
So we were looking at that sentence below
subparagraph (e) about the main argument against
compensation being the treatment offered was the best
available in the light of medical knowledge at the time
,
 
126
and I've just been exploring with you some scenarios in
relation to blood products and treatment with blood
products.
Can I then perhaps test that main argument now in
relation to the position of those who received
transfusions
 
and
, 
again, suggest that it might be
difficult to generalise to the extent set out in this
briefing.
Would you accept, first of all, that the
unnecessary use of blood, so giving transfusions where
they weren't necessarily required or giving too much by
way of a transfusion, was a well-known problem
?  
Later
to be addressed by the Better Blood Transfusion
Initiative and others
, 
which I'll ask you about
tomorrow
.

--Result #701--

If we go to the paragraph that you've referred to that
says that this argument against compensation was the
best available in the light of medical knowledge, and
you said that this document refers to transfusion as
 
130
well as factor concentrates, could I just refresh my
memory on that?

--Result #702--

If we then just continue 
more 
quickly through the rest
of this document, there's a summary of the Department of
Health proposals, I don't propose to read through that
.
If we go to the next page there's a heading "Numbers and
Costs
", 
and it talks about, it gives an
 
estimate of
possible numbers and possible costs.  If we go over the
page, there's reference to CJD and human growth hormone
 
134
patients
.  
Then there's a heading "Treasury
", 
and
a reference to the position or anticipated position of
the Treasury to any financial assistance.
Then if we go to the next page, if we just pick it
up under the heading "Conclusion
", 
Mr Snedden says 
this
at paragraph 22:
"Mounting pressure in the political arena and the
pending legal actions make it increasingly difficult to
hold the line for 
no
 compensation."
Then there's reference to the
Haemophilia Society's campaign
, 
and then picking it up
in the sixth line:
"Continued adverse publicity about 
blood safety,
risks damaging
 confidence in the system.
  There is
 also
the 
question 
of whether 
the case for not offering
compensation is sufficiently robust to hold up,
particularly in view of the Baxter settlement and the
precedent set by 
payments made to those already infected
with HIV."
Then it continues:
"
We have
 
considered
 the administrative
, 
legal and
medical implications of the proposed compromise of
paying 
compensation to those infected with HCV on the
basis of need and/or the harm they have suffered but the
difficulties likely to be encountered 
... 
above appear
 
135
to make such a scheme unworkable.  Legal and medical
opinion suggests that there is 
no
 realistic option but
to compensate all those infected 
through
 contaminated
blood products 
on 
equal terms, the only compromise
possible being on the amount of the settlement and this
is the line we are taking in responding to the
Department of Health."
Now
, 
we'll see how the Department of Health then
deals with the issue shortly
, 
but that being the view
set out by Mr Snedden
, "
increasingly difficult to hold
the line
", "
no realistic option but to compensate all
those infected through contaminated blood products on
equal terms
", 
that being the advice in June
 
1995, what's
your understanding as to why it was not for another
eight years that the Scottish Government decided that
there should be some form of financial assistance to
those 
infected
 with hepatitis C?

--Result #703--

I suspect
, 
at least in part
, for 
the reasons that I have
just outlined, that HIV was seen as a uniquely awful
disease, which merited a precedent being set
.  
But
, 
in
other cases, although of course there are
 -- 
of course
there are similarities, great similarities, between HIV
and HCV, but there was a desire to maintain the HIV
assistance, financial assistance as a unique precedent
and not to set or to enshrine other cases
, 
such as HCV
,
 
136
with the same status.  Because it was well known that
there were other -- 
and 
I've already alluded to this --
other groups of patients 
out 
there suffering from
entirely different conditions
, 
who might 
feel
 that they
had a right to compensation or financial assistance in
the same way as would be offered to HCV sufferers.

--Result #704--

Well,
 there was certainly a couple that come to mind.
There was a group, I think it was called RAGE,
Radiotherapy Action Group
 -- 
I can't remember what the
"
E
"
 stood for
 -- 
but they were a group that formed to
highlight the problems that women with breast cancer 
had
encountered following radiotherapy, and they were
seeking compensation
.
Another was a product called Myodil, which was
a contrast medium for visualising the spine
.  
It was
injected into the spinal cord and caused inflammation
.
So that was another group that were looking for
compensation and there would have been others out there,
I can't remember.  So the view that HCV should not be
added to the precedent set by HIV was founded on that
 

25 July 2022
          
          

  137
context.

--Result #705--

Just to complete the picture in relation to the 1995
decision making, SCGV0000166_054.
This is a letter from the 
Department of Health,
England.  It's from a Mr Guinness to Mr Snedden,
13
 October 1995.  We can see from the handwriting at the
top that it says "Dr Keel for information
", 
so it would
have been
, 
it looks like
, 
copied to you
.  
And we can see
Mr Guinness says in the first paragraph:
"It
 is 
important that we keep in regular touch
over this issue to ensure a consistent presentation of
policy, which 
as
 
you
 
say
 is ultimately a matter for
collective consideration by Government.
"Your concerns over the operational difficulty of
any compensation scheme are 
well
 taken.  As I understand
it part of Roger Scofield
's 
intention in proposing
a problem was to expose the problems of appropriately
targeting resources in the face of a disease of such
uncertain history and variable effects.  I do think that
this will prove useful groundwork in the event that
there is a change in policy."
 
138
Then there's reference to the schemes in the
Republic of Ireland
.  
And then it says:
"As you will be aware my Secretary of State has
made it clear that there is currently 
no
 prospect of
such a change in his mind.  The expense and associated
opportunity cost of any settlement are significant
factors but the main plank of resistance remains
opposition to the principle of a no-fault compensation
scheme.  In evidence to the Health Committee Public
Expenditure Enquiry on 
19
 July the Secretary of
State
 ...
"
Pausing there, that is a reference to
Stephen Dorrell, as I understand it, the then Secretary
of State for Health in England
:
"... 
acknowledged that there was an illogicality
in the payment to HIV infected patients, given that
principle.  
However
 
he did not see this as sufficient
reason to err from it."
So I think it's right that
, 
following the exchange
of documents that we've looked at, and then there are
others that I'm not going to spend time looking at, but
in 1995, although consideration was given in the way in
which we've explored to the possibility of introducing
some form of financial support for those infected with
 
139
hepatitis C, that did not go anywhere in Scotland?

--Result #706--

I'm going to pick matters up, then, in 1998 which
appears to be
, 
at least from the available
documentation, the next occasion on which the matter was
expressly considered.
If we go, please, to SCGV0000167_178
.
This is a minute from Rachel Sunderland,
PS
/
Mr Galbraith
, 29
 July 1998, and it's addressed to
Mr Nichol, and then it's copied to a number of
individuals
.  
It's clearly copied at ministerial level
and it's copied to you
, 
although you're down as
"Mr Keel" rather than 
"
Dr Keel
" 
on that list.
It says:
"Mr Galbraith has seen your minute of 
28
 July
informing him that Mr Dobson was due to announce
yesterday that the Department of Health will not be
offering compensation to individuals infected with 
...
(
HCV
)
 through NHS treatment.  As discussed with you by
telephone Mr Galbraith is content with the
recommendation to adopt a similar position in Scotland
and with the proposed lines to take subject to the
deletion of the fourth bullpoint."
We'll see what that refers to in a moment
.
"The Minister has noted the 'if pressed' line and
 
140
would be grateful if this could be held back, however 
if
it was to be issued then the Minister would be grateful
if the phrase 'public revulsion' could be deleted
.
"
And again we'll see what that refers to
.
Now
 
"
Mr Dobson
"
 is Frank Dobson
, by this time
Secretary of State for Health in the UK
 Government
, 
and
Mr Galbraith was who?

--Result #707--

Yes
.
Then the document that is being referred to in
this minute is at SCGV
0000167
_181
.
And we can see this is from Andy Nichol, Health
Care Policy Division, to Mr Galbraith's Private Office
.
Again, copied to you
 (
you're correctly referred to as
 Dr
rather than Mr Keel on this occasion
) and 
then we can
see that the purpose of the briefing, in paragraph 1,
is:
"To advise Mr Galbraith that Mr Dobson will 
today
be announcing that the Department of Health will not be
offering compensation to individuals infected with
 

25 July 2022
          
          

  141
Hepatitis C 
... 
through NHS treatment, and to recommend
that a similar position be adopted in Scotland."
Then if we go towards the bottom of the page
, 
we
see reference
, 
under the heading "Background
", 
to
The
 
Haemophilia Society
's 
campaign.  I'm not going to
read through that
.
If we go over the page, we can see paragraph 5
describes the previous administration having rejected
claims for a compensation scheme, and then various
grounds are set out, and the first refers
,
 again
,
 to
that line to take of best available treatment
.
If we go to the next page, we can see the heading
"Scottish considerations" just over halfway down the
page, and paragraph 9 reads:
"There are 122 known cases of HCV
-
positive
Scottish parents who have been infected through blood
transfusions or blood products.  It is likely that
today's announcement will lead to a number of actions
for compensation being raised against the Government and
in Scotland there are currently 
10
-12 pending court
actions.  If Mr Galbraith agrees to adopt a similar
position to the Secretary of State for Health, we can
expect the remainder of the 122 Scottish cases to
request Legal Aid to pursue claims for damages."
Then the recommendation in paragraph 10:
 
142
"This issue has always been viewed as a UK-wide
matter which requires the four territorial Death
Departments to adopt a consistent line.  Mr Dobson
's
announcement therefore effectively binds Scotland Wales
and Northern Ireland to following the same line.
Unfortunately
 
Department of Health officials were unable
to give us prior warning of this announcement (we were
first advised yesterday afternoon
).  
However
, 
we see 
no
reason to deviate from the decision 
reached
 by the
Secretary of State for Health and would recommend that
Mr Galbraith agree to adopt a similar position in
Scotland."
And we 
know
 from that minute that we looked at
that Mr Galbraith did indeed accept that recommendation.
Then if we go over the page, the "Line to Take":
"
11.  
In the likely event of media enquiries
I would suggest the following line to take
 ...
"
The first refers to 
"
great sympathy
"
 and 
"
personal
tragedy
"
.
The second is this:
"This has been a very hard decision for the
Government to take on a complex issue which is why it
has taken so long to come to a view."
Now, just pausing there, this briefing doesn't
necessarily read as reflecting a very hard decision for
 
143
the Government to take on a complex issue.  It reads as
Scotland effectively falling into line behind the
decision of Mr Dobson in England.
Are you able to tell us whether, from your
perspective, there was indeed a long period of
consideration resulting in a very hard decision for the
Government to take?

--Result #708--

Then I'm afraid I can't enlighten you on that.  I mean
,
a
 
lot of this kind of discussion around possible
compensation schemes would have been led very much by
policy colleagues and legal advisers, rather than the
medical side of the house.  I mean
, 
obviously my view
was taken on the medical comments included in the
submissions
 
but the direction of policy was very much
driven by policy colleagues.

--Result #709--

  
Yes
.
Just before we stop for the evening, I wonder if
you could help me with something
.  
Can we just go back
to the previous page on this document that is currently
on the 
screen
., and it's paragraph 5 there, the -- it's
saying what the previous administration had done, it
had
:
"... 
rejected claims for a compensation scheme on
the grounds ...
"
And I'm just interested in the formulation of what
is said at the beginning, in the light of some of the
evidence that you have been asked about this afternoon,
and it's:
 
147
"
... that 
the patients concerned received the best
treatment available at the time, given the state of
knowledge about HCV and the lack of a reliable screening
test."
You told counsel that you
 -- 
I think by the time
that this was written, you accepted that it was known
that hepatitis C was a serious disease
, 
with potential
long-term serious consequences, which could be fatal.
Now
, 
if one were to add to that the potential for
somebody who is a carrier of that disease and isn't
detected because of a lack of an appropriate test, let's
say
, 
that would add to the reservoir of those who had
infection in the community, that would be a matter of
interest, I suppose, to Government, the Public Health
wing, because it would want to prevent that pool
developing and leading to further problems, would it
not?

--Result #710--
 Throughout this time frame of your first stage in t he 
DHSS, as it were, there were a number of memos and 
a submission to the minister about whether 
a compensation scheme, a financial assistance schem e, 
should be established for those infected with 
hepatitis C. 

--Result #711--

  
Professor Keel, I want to ask you next about
the Scottish Executive Inquiry that was undertaken
between 1999 and 2000.  I want to start
 
in the middle
of
 
1999, so before the decision had been taken to have
the Inquiry, at SCGV0000176_118.
This is from Mr Bell in the Health Care Policy
Division
, 
15 July 1999
, 
and we can see it is addressed
to the minister and copied to, amongst others, you, and
the purpose of the briefing is to brief the minister on
The Haemophilia Society's continuing campaign for
compensation for haemophiliacs infected with hepatitis C
as a result of NHS treatment using blood or blood
products.
And if we go over the page, having referred to
The
 
Haemophilia Society's campaign, paragraph 4 explains
that:
"
The
 previous administration rejected claims for
such a no-fault payment scheme on the grounds that ..."
 
2
Then
 before we look at any of those 
bullet points,
we're
,
 here
,
 looking at middle of July 1999, so would it
be right to understand that we're now in a devolved
government, exercising healthcare powers?

--Result #712--

If 
we
 pick matters up next in September, about a week or
so later
, 
at SCGV0000043_
0
47.  So this is a briefing
provided by Mr Palmer, who we 
saw
 in attendance at those
two meetings, to the Minister
, 
8 September 1999, copied
to you
, 
amongst obviously a number of others
.  
The
purpose is described in paragraph 1 as:
"To provide initial briefing to the Minister prior
to her meeting with the Haemophilia Society on
14 September ..."
If we go over the page, we can see paragraph 5
sets out what the Government's position has been,
essentially if there's no fault there should be 
no
compensation and the assertion is made there again that
patients received the best treatment available given the
state of knowledge at the time.
Then paragraph 6 says this --

--Result #713--

  
Yes
.
  Then paragraph 6 says:
"Agreeing no-fault compensation for haemophiliacs
with HCV would have major policy implications in that it
would promote the elastic concept of 'a moral liability'
on government to compensate individuals who have been
damaged, however inadvertently, by its actions ..."
Now
, 
this is Mr Palmer's briefing, professor, not
yours, but do you recall what your 
thoughts 
were at the
time about the concept of a moral liability or moral
responsibility?

--Result #714--

Well, at the time
, 
my view was that there had been
no fault attributed to SNBTS or the NHS and that that
was the
 
justification there had been for many, many
years of the Government's position
, 
with the exception
of the precedent we discussed yesterday
 
for HIV.
So my view 
was
 -- I mean
, 
Mike Palmer's language
is slightly difficult to interpret, but I suppose what
he's
 trying to say is that
, 
where patients had been
 
16
damaged but 
no
 negligence has been proved on the part of
the NHS, then for the Government to embark on
an
 
open-ended no-fault compensation scheme would be
a very major change in policy with major implications
further down the 
route on
 the amount of money to be
spent
 
and
, 
therefore
, by 
definition, the amount of money
then available for direct patient care.
I think that's probably what 
he's
 trying to get
at.  Of course
, 
it's his words, as you said, not mine.

--Result #715--

If we turn to the next page, we can see in paragraph 
(
b
)
the link being made with the possibility of
compensation
.  
Then on paragraph (c) says this:
"The Department aims to report on its
investigations within a month
 ...
"
Now
, 
as it happened, it took over a year, it's
late October 2000
, 
I think
, 
when the report was
published.  What's your understanding of why it took
that length of time?

--Result #716--

If we go to SCGV0000170_152
.
This is still in September 1999.  If we look at
the top of the page
, 
it's an email 
sent
 on behalf of the
 

26 July 2022
          
          

  33
First Minister, 
23
 September.  And again, it's copied to
you
, 
amongst others
, 
and it says this:
"The First Minister has seen your minute of
17
 September to the Minister for Health outlining a way
forward following the meeting with the
Haemophilia Society.  He was a little concerned about
the possible financial implications and fears that an
open mind could be taken to mean an open cheque
 
book.
He would be grateful for information on the likely
exposure if compensation were to be awarded."
Now
, 
before we look at anything else on 
this
document, do you have any recollection of your thoughts
when you 
saw
 this email, and the fear about an open
mind?

--Result #717--

No,
 I don't recall what I thought when I 
saw
 the email,
but clearly, any administration would want to 
be able to
quantify the amount associated with the compensation if
that were to be rewar
ded
 -- awarded.  And as we've seen
from earlier documents, in preparation for this kind of
response from ministers, the Department had already
begun to try to scope the numbers
, 
so that from -- 
who
might be eligible -- 
from those numbers we could
 
build
scenarios around the possible financial implications of
such a scheme if it were adopted.

--Result #718--

Could we look at the bottom part of the page, please.
 
34
There's a note on the right-hand side which I think says
this:
"
Ms
 Deacon's office 
advises
 that this is very much
a PR exercise and that there is unlikely to be any
compensation paid."
Now
, 
this is nine
 
days after the meeting with The
Haemophilia Society where the Minister has said to The
Haemophilia Society "We're going to be open and
transparent".  Obviously
, 
this is a matter that
Ms
 Deacon will 
no
 doubt be asked about 
in 
the course of
the week but do you maintain the answer you gave earlier
that
, 
from your perspective
, 
this was an
 
independent and
impartial investigation in light of
, 
what's said to be
here
, 
the advice from the Minister that it was very much
a PR exercise?

--Result #719--

Well,
 as I said in my written statement, I certainly
don't agree with the use of the term "PR exercise".
Undoubtedly
, 
ministers were under great pressure to
further investigate this area
 
and
 
The
 
Haemophilia
Society undoubtedly had in mind compensation at the end
of 
that
 period.  However, I don't think that means that
the investigation
 -- 
the internal investigation was not
conducted in an
 
entirely proper way
, 
as I said, earlier,
finding out the facts, detailing the chronology
, 
so that
we could really understand what The Haemophilia
 
35
Society
 -- 
whether what The
 
Haemophilia
 
Society were
alleging was true or not.  So the use of this term does
not tally with my recollection of that period around the
investigation
.

--Result #720--

Then you suggest that the paragraph could
 "
refer to the
fact that comparable developments in the commercial
sector usually take significantly longer than SNBTS's
 

26 July 2022
          
          

  53
development
"
.
I'll come back to that in a moment but if we just
go over the page, you then say this:
"Finally, as far as financial help is concerned,
you will need 
no
 remind
ing
 that DH are very nervous
about this.  Mike McGovern made a point of bringing the
issue up with me during a recent unrelated telephone
conversation
, 
during which I reassured him that we
recognised that compensation in this area would set
a very difficult precedent for the Government, given the
many claims for compensation that it receives."
Now
, 
bearing in mind Ms Dora's role was to
investigate whether there had been fault on the part of
SNBTS or negligence on the part of SNBTS, and to reach
conclusions, why was it relevant for you to remind her
that the Department of Health was very nervous about the
possibility of financial help?

--Result #721--

Well,
 because it was a material issue that was
discussed
 -- 
being discussed
 
at that time.  I mean
, 
it's
not directly relevant to the investigation but clearly
from previous documents we have seen that the
Scottish Office, Scottish Executive subsequently, 
had
over the years already done some pre-planning around the
impact that setting up a compensation scheme would have.
Not expecting that that would be the case, but in
 
54
preparation for that, should it be an eventuality.

--Result #722--

The report itself
, 
in final form
, 
was published in
October 2000 but I'm not 
going
 
to
 take time going
through that with you, Professor Keel, and we can pick
that up with 
Ms
 Deacon later in the week.
I want, then, to look at some documentation and
decision making from 2000 onwards on the issue of
financial support for hepatitis C.  Some of it overlaps
with the time period of the investigation
.  
So if we
start with DHSC0032292_045.
 
60
This is an
 
email chain in April 2000, so
 
it's
after the first draft of the report has been produced
and it's while the report is being finalised.  If we go
to the second page
, 
we can pick up the email chain
.  
So
the bottom half of the page we have, if we go just up
a few lines, please, Lawrence, further up, so I can see
who the email -- thank you, perfect
.
So 
we
 can see Ms Dora is sending an
 
email on
19
 
April to you and to a number of others and she says
in the 
body 
of the email:
"Thanks to those of you who have 
commented
 up to
now on my attempts to draft a report.  Please find
attached what I hope is now a pretty final draft
Ministerial submission with recommendations on
handling."
Then if we go to the top of the page, we've got
an
 
email from John Aldridge, and we can pick it up in
the third paragraph of the email
, 
where he says this:
"I note the issues on which 
you are
 seeking the
Minister's views.  I think she should be pointed very
firmly in the direction of not agreeing to compensation
or special priority treatment for Hep
 
C sufferers who
may have been infected by NHS treatment.  That would
have huge implications for other areas of NHS activity
,
and would
, I am
 sure be resisted strongly by colleagues
 

26 July 2022
          
          

  61
in the other parts of the UK and the Treasury as well as
by me
!
"
Then if we go to the first page, we can see
there's a name there about a 
third
 of the way down the
page, Francis Gibb.  What was the role of Francis Gibb
within the Department?

--Result #723--

Then we can see the comment from Mr Gibb, so just below
the list of attendees, is 
this
:
"I agree with these sentiments as they 
are 
in tune
with the advice we gave at the meeting.  Beware of going
down a path which could have serious repercussions for
the future
.  
We could open the floodgates if we are not
careful."
Do the views there expressed by Mr Gibb and
Mr Aldridge reflect the general thinking in the
Department in Scotland at the time, which was
,
essentially
, 
fundamentally
 
opposed to financial support
or compensation for those infected with hepatitis C?

--Result #724--

Yes
, for the reasons that we discussed in some detail
yesterday
, 
setting yet another 
precedent, 
which would
 
62
mean that other groups
 -- 
and I mentioned some of them
yesterday
 -- 
who felt that they 
would be 
entitled to
compensation
 
would not being 
allowed
 access to it
.  
So
,
yes
, this was the general
 
feeling in the Department at
that point.

--Result #725--

If we go to your statement, WITN5736003, page 44, you
were referred to that email exchange and then we can see
your answer at A76
.  
You say
: 
"
These views were held in SE 
[so Scottish
Executive] and the health department around this time
..."
Then 
in paragraph (b) 
you set out your view:
"I agreed that the establishment of a scheme 
for
compensation 
of HCV infected patients would set
a dangerous precedent."
Then you go on to explain about other possible
categories of patients
, 
and (c) says your
: 
"... 
a
d
vice to Ministers would have been along the
lines outlined above
 ...
"
Now "dangerous precedent" is, it might be said,
quite a strong way of putting it.  Does that reflect
your own strength of feeling at the time?

--Result #726--

Then if we could go
,
 please
,
 to SCGV0000171_031.
If we look at the second page, we'll see
 -- 
we
 
63
don't need to look at the detail of
 
it
, 
but this is part
of the same email chain
, 
so we've got Christine Dora
's
email at the bottom,
 
John Aldridge's response at the
top.
If we go back to the first page, we can see
, 
at
the bottom half of the page, Ms Dora's response to
Mr Aldridge
.  
She says this:
"I note what you say about pointing the Minister
away from compensation.  I'm intending to leave the
arguments about compensation and other possible action
to a future minute
, 
for the sake of digestibility.
I
 
agree that the arguments tend against the award of
compensation 
(
or hardship payments
)
.  The
Macfarlane Trust for 
people infected with HIV is an
uncomfortable 
precedent in this respect
, 
so we'll need
to marshal
 
the arguments carefully.  I also understand
that Lord Hunt at the 
Dept
 of Health has been 
reflecting
on the idea of a possible hardship fund for
 Hepatitis C
victims
 ...
"
Then this:
"
... 
I really think it would be wise to have both
Ministers discuss and at least decide whether to operate
in step with each other
 (
although I am hoping they will
decide the same thing
 
and it won't be compensation
)
."
Now this is the author of the investigation
 
64
report
.  
Why is it part of the role
 -- 
or is it part of
the 
role
 of 
a 
civil servant to hope that people infected
with a serious potentially 
fatal 
virus do not get
compensation?  Does it 
concern
 you the way in which
Ms Dora, the author of the report, expressed herself?

--Result #727--

No
, I can't say I'm concerned by it.  You have to
remember
, 
compensation was not part of the remit of this
internal investigation.  However, it was foreseen
, 
and
had been for many years, that compensation was an issue,
and could 
become
 an even bigger issue following the
publication of the report.  I think Christine Dora was
merely sharing in the general sentiment around the
Departments of Health up until that point that
 
going
down the route of a compensation scheme
, 
where 
no
negligence had been demonstrated, would be ill advised.

--Result #728--

If we move forward from April 2000 to February 2001, and
go to SCGV0000174_068, this is an email from
Christine Dora
, 
again 19 February 2001
, 
to a number of
recipients
, 
including you
, 
and it says
 -- 
records
a conversation she's had with Charles Lister from the
Department of Health in London
, 
and then the first
paragraph says this:
"Lord Hunt has apparently agreed to 
meet
Lord Morris
 (
President of the Haemophilia Society
) 
and
others tomorrow 
... 
to 
revisit
 the idea of compensation
 

26 July 2022
          
          

  65
for Hep C 
positive 
haemophiliacs.  I understand this may
be prompted by political considerations
; 
I also however
understand that Lord Hunt incline
s 
naturally towards
sympathy for the plight of the affected haemophiliacs
.
Officials
' 
advice has not changed
, 
but they
 have 
been
asked
 to 
put together costings for various options and
to offer an assessment of the extent of any 
precedent
which might be created."
Then this:
"Charles and I acknowledge
d
 that if one of the 
4
administrations should crack, it becomes
presentationally much more difficult for the others not
to, and he said he would keep us informed."
Now
,
 of course
,
 this is 
two
 years into
 -- 
or
more
 -- 
into devolution by this point in time
, 
and
Scotland has responsibility for its own health issues
and is free to take its own course.  What, if anything,
do you recall about the concern 
of
 holding a common line
between the four administrations and the 
presentational
difficulty referred to there?  Do you recall that being
discussed?

--Result #729--

Well, I can't specifically recall the discussions, but
reading this and other papers has reminded me that it
was indeed a matter of concern as to whether Lord Hunt
was going to deviate from the previously agreed position
 
66
across the UK that there would not be a compensation
scheme.  So I recall that element of it, but specific
discussions, 
no
.

--Result #730--

Now as you'll recall, Professor
, 
the Health and
Community Care Committee of the Scottish Parliament
undertook their 
own
 inquiry of forms and produced
a report into 2001
.  
 
68
That's at MACK0001929_001.
I don't propose to go through the detail of it
.
We can see the title of the report there
.
If we just go to page 23, we can pick up what the
Committee said about financial assistance.  So you'll
see, Professor
, 
the heading "
Targeted
 financial and
other assistance regardless of negligence
".  
Then the
report reads
, 
in paragraph 83:
"The more that we as a Committee have investigate
d
the issues raised in the two petitions, the more our
conviction has grown that what lies behind both is
a fundamental question of fairness and consistency.
"84.  
The individuals who petitioned us contracted
a serious and incurable virus many years ago as a result
of medical treatment, or are relatives of those people
.
Understandably
, 
they 
feel
 wronged
, 
and have campaigned
over many years for recognition and redress.  To these
individuals the relatively narrow question of whether or
not any particular agency or individual within the NHS
has been legally negligent
, 
while important and worthy
of exploration, is of secondary importance.  What 
it
they consider more important is that the Executive
recognise what they would classify as the moral case for
providing support
, 
and that it provides the concrete
practical assistance that they consider would be fair
 

26 July 2022
          
          

  69
and appropriate."
Then the paragraphs go on to set out in 85 and 86
the 
general principle about not paying out unless
there's negligence and then
 
referring to exceptions
within that, the Consumer Protection Act
, 
and then in
paragraph 86
 the 
Macfarlane Trust.
If we go over the page, and pick it up at the
bottom half of the page -- 
no
, 
in fact
, 
I'm sorry
, 
could
we
 pick it up at paragraph 88
, first
 of all, towards the
top of the page
:
"The example cited by [and the name is redacted
but it's someone on behalf of The Haemophilia Society]
is a simple and striking one.  It is difficult to
disagree that it highlights the inconsistency of the
current position
, 
especially given that the effects of
hepatitis C can, when severe, be practically as
devastating as those of HIV."
Then paragraph 90 says this:
"Having considered the issues raised in the
petitions, the Committee has 
become
 persuaded by what 
we
classified as the 
'
moral
'
 case for providing financial
assistance to those individuals infected with
hepatitis C through blood transfusions."
Then the Committee goes on to say that they're not
advocating a transition to a complete no-fault
 
70
compensation scheme
.  
At paragraph 91
, 
they say this:
"The Committee therefore wishes to stress the
narrowness of the view to which 
it has
 come.  
We are
 not
advocating the principle that all injury caused through
NHS treatment should be compensated
.  
Nor are we asking
the Executive to establish any
 
new
, 
wide-ranging
precedent on the 
management
 of risk in clinical
decision
-
making.  Instead we simply seek to correct
an
 
inconsistency in the operation of an
 
already created
and narrow precedent
; 
namely the precedent create when
the Macfarlane Trust was set up.  We do not envisage
that any ad hoc decision to provide financial or other
help to individuals infected with hepatitis C through
NHS treatment
, 
would necessarily require the NHS to
change any of its current medical policies and practices
on risk arising from treatment
.
"
So
, 
professor
, 
it's right, isn't it, that the
Committee did not share your view and the Department's
view that this would establish a dangerous precedent?

--Result #731--

Then if we just go to the 
"
Recommendations
"
 on page 26,
we can pick it up at the bottom of the page:
"We recommend 
that 
the Executive set up
 
71
a mechanism for providing financial and other
appropriate practical support to all hepatitis C
sufferers who have contracted the virus as a
 
result of
blood transfusions provided by the NHS in Scotland
, 
or
which involve blood or blood products produced by the
SNBTS."
Then if we go to the next page, I won't read the
recommendations in full
, 
but paragraphs 2, 3 and 4
provide as follows:
"
2.  
We recommend that this mechanism for
providing financial and other support comes into
operation within a period of 
twelve
 months.
"3.  
The level
 
of financial assistance awarded to
any claimant should be determined on the basis of need,
having regard to the physical or psychological loss
individually suffered, and should include redress for
practical difficulties such as the inability to obtain
an
 
affordable mortgage or life insurance."
Then
: 
"
4
.  
In determining an
 
appropriate package of
assistance
, 
and in particular 
in 
clarifying what
practical help can be offered
, 
the Executive should
consult hepatitis C sufferers
 -- 
both haemophiliac and
non-haemophiliac."
Now
, 
before I ask you about that, can I just show
 
72
you an
 
email you 
sent
 in response.  It's at
SCGV0000247_094.  This is from you, 3 October 2001, to
Mrs Falconer
, 
copied to others.  Paragraph 1:
"You were right to emphasise in our initial
response to this that we will require time to consider
its recommendation
s
!  
No
 surprises in the sense that we
were expecting the Committee to recommend compensation
for those who have contracted Hep C through blood
transfusion and fall outside the terms of the Burton
Judgment."
Then you go on to make number of points.  I don't
think I need to take you through those.  You suggest in
paragraph 2 that the Committee has underestimated the
difficulty in determining levels of compensation based
on need.
What do you recall of your response to
 
and your
thoughts about the Committee's report?  I don't mean
some of the finer points of detail
, 
but the broad thrust
of it, which is the Executive should set 
up 
a scheme for
compensation and recommending something which went
directly against the policy which the Executive and its
predecessor had maintained for a number of years?

--Result #732--

Well, 
a 
number of observations if I may.  First of all,
going back to the report, it talks about haemophiliacs
and probably recipients of blood transfusion feeling
 

26 July 2022
          
          

  73
wronged.  As I pointed out yesterday
 
and again 
today
:
those groups were not unique.  There were other groups
which we were aware of
, 
and doubtless others
 
that we're
not aware of, who were interested
 
in pursuing
compensation.  So
 
the report, in using that phase,
doesn't acknowledge the wider context and possibility
 --
nay, reality
 -- 
that others would come forward if
a compensation scheme was set up for this group of
individuals.
I've commented in my -- in paragraph 2 here on how
you would go about setting up the difficulties in going
about setting up such a scheme based on need.  How would
you define physical or psychological loss at individual
level?  I could already envisage real difficulties in
defining categories of patients and the level of their
suffering to be compensated.
So 
I guess
 my reading of the report was that it
was slightly naive in its assumption that you could just
set up a scheme and that would be very straightforward.
And I also think that their conclusion that they
didn't want to compensate everybody who had been injured
at the hands of the NHS
, 
in their view
 -- 
they didn't
want a compensation scheme that covered everybody
, 
and
that seemed to me rather illogical in singling out
hepatitis C infected individuals as a special category
 
74
for compensation when there were other groups of
patients out there who would 
feel
 equally wronged
 
and
equally eligible for such compensation.

--Result #733--

My recollection of the setting up of the Lord Ross
expert group is I really had very little to do with it.
This was a matter for officials and legal advisers to be
fully involved in.  You would need to ask ministers what
was in their minds in terms of setting up the expert
 
75
group.  Part of it certainly was, as far as I could
recollect, to get a better handle on the difficulties
I've already mentioned, and are covered in paragraph 2
here, of defining levels of compensation
 
and I think at
least part of the expert group's task was to try to
better understand those difficulties
.

--Result #734--

Can I ask you then to look at something you say in your
witness statement more broadly on the question of
compensation.
It's WITN5736003
, 
and if 
we
 could go to page 60
and it's the bottom half of the page.
You were asked in question 105 about some 
emails
regarding the costs of a scheme.  I'm not going to ask
you about that.  But you say in paragraph A105, third
line:
"I 
regretted
 that the Burton judgment had for
ced
a move
 away from the previous principal 
[sic]
 
that 
no
compensation was due where there was no 
negligence
proven
 on the part of NHS."
Now the expression of regret about the Burton
judgment is not
, I think, a view
 
that 
the Inquiry has
heard from others so far in the course of its hearings.
Why 
did
 
you
 
feel
 that way about a judgment of the High
Court?

--Result #735--

Because it seemed logical to me that the previous
 
76
principle
, 
that 
no
 compensation was due 
if there had
been
 
no
 negligence proven
, 
was a sound one.  And the
Burton judgment clearly opened
 -- 
or exposed the NHS to
much 
wider
, 
a much wider range of liabilities ie,
providing compensation where 
no
 negligence had been
proven.

--Result #736--

What was, as far as you can recall, your view about what
was being recommended by the Expert Group
, 
in
 
terms of
compensation
/
financial support?

--Result #737--

Well, I have 
no
 direct memory from that time.  I
 
mean
,
I've obviously read papers referring to the Expert Group
and
, 
certainly
, 
the levels of compensation being
proposed were perceived as rather 
high
 and therefore
unaffordable.  But I can't say that was my original
thought.  It's been derived from reading the papers.

--Result #738--

I think we can see an
 
example of the discussions that
were held at SCGV0001034_014.  There's certainly some
earlier exchange with Dr Hayes in February
 
2003.  This
now is
, 
I think
, 
October
 
2003 and it's reference
 
to
a
 
meeting on 10 October 2003.
 
84
If we go over the page, if we pick it up at the
bottom of the page
 -- 
this is a general meeting about
hepatitis C but then an
 
issue is picked up at the bottom
of the page where it says
: 
"
Aileen Keel acknowledged that in line with
David
 
Goldberg's previous modelling work
, 
the Executive
was working on an estimate of
 [
and then 
'
400
'
 has been
crossed out and 
'
253
'

]
 persons who may be
eligible for the higher level of ex
-
gratia 
payment
 of
compensation
, 
having contracted their infection through
infect
ion 
[sic]
 
blood or blood products
.  
Dr Keel
explained that she and Bob Stock were to meet with
colleagues in DH to work out a trigger for the 
2nd 
level
of payment which 
could 
include up to 580
 
patients with
30% of these being paid in the first year.  She
explained that it was not going to be easy to define the
trigger and that whatever was agreed would need to be
agreeable to the Haemophilia Society."
Then if we go to just
, 
I think
, 
one further
document
, 
SCGV000
0
265_004
, 
we've got here a meeting
which is then specifically focused on the ex gratia
payment
 
scheme
.  
This is 14 October 2003
.  
It refers to
a number of people being present and the purpose of the
meeting 
is 
to discuss the 
medical 
trigger point for the
proposed higher payment
.
 

26 July 2022
          
          

  85
Now
, 
I'm not going to go through the detail of
what was discussed
, 
but do you recall whether there was
,
at this point in time
, 
a series of meetings to discuss
issues relating to the parameters and the working out of
the ex gratia payment scheme or whether there were just
one or two such encounters?

--Result #739--

While notwithstanding the existence of this Inquiry
 
and
certainly notwithstanding the 
compen -- 
or 
the 
financial
support that has been provided for these patients, and
fully recognising the fact that they have been through
significant physical and mental problems arising from
their infection, I still believe that the logic here
would have been not to set up a financial assistance
scheme specifically with this group of patients, because
it elevated their problems to a higher level than many
other groups
, 
who were pursuing
 -- 
equally justif
iab
ly,
 
116
seeking compensation for other ills that the NHS
allegedly had inflicted on them.  I didn't see the logic
in that.
And in terms of public inquiries, 
well
, I mean
,
I hope this one will indeed shed further light on the
issues
 
but
, 
at the time that the public inquiry was
being resisted in Scotland, I believed and I still
believe that
, 
at that stage
, 
no
 additional evidence had
emerged that would have merited a public inquiry
 
and
,
therefore
, 
I think that
, 
at that stage anyway, it would
not have been appropriate for Scotland.

--Result #740--

Well, I've been seconded out of Government for 7 years
,
so I certainly can't comment on current thinking in that
area.  But as I said, I've said many times, the concern
around introducing 
the 
HCV assistan
ce 
scheme was that it
would activate other groups that we knew were already
out there, others unknown to us, to make claims.
I mean
, 
I'm not in principle against a no-fault
compensation scheme.  Many countries have them.  But
most of the payments arising from some such schemes are
 
132
relatively modest, and they take a great deal of
designing.  So
 
I mean
, 
my mind was open as to whether we
explored 
that
 possibility.  During my time in
Government, I think it was always in the '
too
 difficult'
box to really pursue and come out the other end with
a scheme that would fit with the NHS.

--Result #741--

Yes,
 
well,
 that was another -- I mean
, 
I think there are
petitions at Westminster but I don't think very much
happens with them
, 
whereas there was 
actually
a Petitions Committee in the Scottish Parliament and
when 
petitions 
were brought to the Petitions Committee
they could decide what to do with them
.  
But quite
frequently they referred them to the subject committee
.  
So the two petitions relating to the subject we're
discussing were sent to the Health Committee in the
early days of the Parliament.  I think one relate
d
 to
the issue of a public inquiry and one relate
d
 to the
issue of compensation
 (
so
, 
in a sense
, 
two of our
central issues
)
 and the Health Committee then 
had
 to
decide what to do with those petitions
.
And
, 
as I said in my written statement
, 
in the
days when I was on the Health Committee
, 
there was
really very little discussion of those petitions because
the Committee made the decision to leave detailed
consideration of those petitions until the report which
Susan Deacon had commissioned into the heat treatment of
blood products in the period 1985 to 1987 had been
 
23
completed
.
So that was the position of the Health Committee
in the time I was on it but
, 
clearly
, 
once
 I had left
it, and Susan Deacon's report had been dealt with by the
Committee, they then went on to take a great deal more
evidence, including from the Scottish Blood Transfusion
Service and Haemophilia Scotland, and 
then 
they produced
a report, I suppose, about a year after I'd left the
Committee.

--Result #742--

I'm going to turn now to ask some questions about the
issue of a compensation scheme or payment scheme for
those infected with hepatitis C from infected blood and
blood products.
Now
, 
you were appointed Deputy Minister for Health
and Community Care just after, is this right, the
internal investigation you've mentioned that
Susan Deacon commissioned was published
?

--Result #743--

October 
2000
.  
Just to be clear
, 
we have Susan Deacon
coming to give evidence tomorrow
, 
so
 
I'm going to be
asking her questions about that report
.  
But was there
a sense, when you were coming into your post, that that
question of whether or not there should be
a compensation or payment scheme had effectively been
dealt with and put to bed by the report and by the
Scottish Executive's conclusion
s
 that there'd been 
no
negligence on the part of the SNBTS and so
, 
therefore
,
there would be 
no
 compensation paid
?

--Result #744--

I'm going to pick up matters in October 2001, so just
shortly before you had 
become
 Minister, with the 
report
published by the Health and Community Care Committee,
which we find at MACK0001929_001.
That
, 
we can see
, 
is the heading of the 2001
report on hepatitis C
 -- 
if we can just go please to
page 9, we can see the point we've just been discussing
,
"
The Committee's involvement
", 
at paragraph 6:
"The Health and Community Care Committee's direct
involvement in this issue arises from two petitions
referred to us by the Public Petitions Committee."
Then it sets out the detail of those two
commissions
 -- 
sorry, those two petitions.
If we could then turn
, 
please -- 
well,
 the
Committee then sets out the background
, 
including the
handing down of the judgment in -- by Mr Justice Burton
in the
 
A and Others
 hepatitis C litigation, which I'll
come on to ask you questions about later on 
today
.
Then if we turn then, please, to page 13
, 
we can
see the main areas for consideration, and it says this:
"We found that consideration of the issues raised
by the two petitions resolved into three main questions
.  
"
Firstly
 
there was 
the
 
question
 of whether, on the
 
26
basis of the evidence currently in the public domain,
the SNBTS or any other body within the health
 
care
system could be held to have been at fault in allowing
some individuals to 
become
 exposed to hepatitis C
contaminated blood.
"
Secondly, we had to consider the call from the
Haemophilia Society and others for an
 independent
inquiry into all the relevant circumstances surrounding
the entry of contaminated blood into the healthcare
system
.
"
Finally
 
there was a question whether
 -- 
even if
negligence could not be ascribed to any relevant body
 --
it would be appropriate to award some form of financial
or other assistance, whether described as compensation
or not
, 
to help hepatitis C 
sufferers
 infected through
NHS treatment to deal with the consequences of their
illness."
It
'
s in relation to that last question that I'm
going to ask you questions.  The Committee deal with the
first and second questions, I'll just go to those very
briefly for completeness.
We can see what they say about the negligence
question if we go down the page.  They say:
"Argu
ably
 there was 
no
 need for us to consider the
first question because it had already been 
answered
.
 
27
The Executive's inquiry exonerated the SNBTS of
negligence and also concluded there was 
no
 evidence that
haemophilia centre directors 
had
 failed to give adequate
advice on blood transfusion risks to patients."
That's a reference there to the 
report
 
that 
you
mentioned from October 2000, is it?

--Result #745--

Then the Committee go on to point out that
The Haemophilia
 
Society have been critical of that
report
 
and so
, 
in paragraph 27
, 
we see that they gave
the opportunity for further evidence.
Then we can see the conclusions are at 17,
page 17, on the 
"
use of the ALT test
": 
"
The limited evidence the Committee considered
makes 
it
 difficult to reach a definitive conclusion
."  
But saying at 44, paragraph 44
:
"
We
 were largely persuaded by the case put by the
SNBTS that the decision not to use the ALT test was
predominantly a clinical one, and we acknowledge 
that
there appear to have been number of important reasons
for not using the test.  Not least among
 these 
was the
risk of running out of blood supplies needed for
essential medical treatment.  It does not appear to us
that the decision not to use the test could be described
in hindsight as unjustifiable or unreasonable."
 
28
Then the second issue on negligence they looked
 
at
was
 "
Unnecessary delay by the SNBTS
", 
and that's set out
at paragraph 46
, 
the allegation
, 
and the conclusions 
we
can see at page 19
, 
paragraph 53
: 
"
Conclusions
: 
unnecessary delay?"
"On the basis of the limited evidence we
considered
, 
we could take only a provisional view.  This
was that there was 
no
 evidence of negligent delay on the
part of the SNBTS.  It was not clear that, given the
level of scientific knowledge at the time, 
the
 SNBTS
should have acted differently."
Then it goes on to consider the failure to inform
patients fully of the risks involved, and we can see
what they say at paragraph 56:
"On this matter
, 
there appears to be a clear
difference of opinion between the findings in the
Executive's report and the personal testimony of
witnesses from the Haemophilia Society."
Then if we go over to page 20, the conclusion at
paragraph 66:
"This apparent failure of some clinicians to
disclose treatment risks openly to some haemophiliacs
might, we think, be partially mitigate
d 
by the apparent
lack of awareness of the potential seriousness of the
NANBH virus at the time.  More importantly, medical
 

28 July 2022
          
          

  29
practitioners would have been aware that alternative
treatments for bleeding, such as cryoprecipitate, or the
option of simply not treating uncontrolled bleeding,
would themselves have carried serious health risks.
This would clearly have influenced the advice clinicians
gave their patients."
They then go on to look at the second issue
,
"
Should there be an
 
independent inquiry?"
 
and the
conclusion that they reach in relation to that
 
is that
they don't support an
 
independent inquiry.
Then 
if we come on to 
page 23, 
we can see what
they said about the third issue
, 
the HCV, 
hepatitis C,
compensation or payment scheme
:
"
Targeted financial or other assistance regardless
of negligence.
"The more that we as a Committee have investigated
the
 issue
s
 raised in the two petitions
, 
the more our
conviction has grown that what lies behind both is
a fundamental question of fairness and consistency.
"
The individuals who petitioned us contracted
a serious and incurable virus many years ago as a
 
result
of medical treatment, or are relatives of 
those 
people.
Understandably
, 
they 
feel
 wrong
ed, 
and have campaigned
over many years for recognition and redress.  To these
individuals the relatively narrow question of whether or
 
30
not any particular agency or individual within the NHS
has been legally negligent, whil
e 
important and worthy
of exploration, is of secondary importance.  What they
consider more important is that the Executive recognise
what they would classify as the moral case for providing
support, and that it provides the concrete, practical
assistance that they consider 
would be 
fair and
appropriate.
"
The Scottish Executive has consistently referred
to the principle that governments pay out compensation
only when they or their agencies have been demonstrably
negligent as justification for their current policy.
There are, however, instances of exceptions to this
principle, including some in the medical 
sphere
, in
which individuals can claim damages or other financial
assistance without having to prove fault.  One example
is the Consumer Protection Act 1987."
So there, was it your understanding that they're
there referring to the decision of Mr Justice Burton in
the
 
A and Others
 case
.

--Result #746--

Then if we go down to paragraph 86, they give the
further example of that as being the Macfarlane Trust
.
Then
, 
at paragraph 87, they say this:
"That individuals who contract one type of virus
 
31
through contaminated blood transfusions should have
recourse to financial assistance on a no-fault basis,
while those infected in the same way with another virus
do not is, for the Haemophilia Society, illogical and
unfair."
If we then go over the page, please, at
paragraph 89:
"As we have already said
, 
the Executive's recent
decision to settle with all of those individuals
intending to bring an
 action 
under the Consumer
Protection Act 1987 is welcome.  If anything, however,
it merely creates a new inconsistency.  Now
, 
as we
understand it, anyone infected after 1 March 1988 (when
the Act came into force) who has instructed a lawyer
will be entitled to financial assistance from the
Executive, while anyone infect
ed
 before this arbitrary
date, or who was infected afterwards but who has not
instructed a lawyer, will not.  In our view, this only
goes to underline the need for a consistent 
and
principled approach.
"
Pausing there
, just 
to reiterate what I was 
asking
you earlier
, 
I will come back and ask you some questions
in relation to that issue later on 
today
.
Then at paragraph 90:
"Having considered the issues raised in the
 
32
petitions, the Committee has 
become
 persuaded by what 
we
classified as the 
'
moral
'
 case for providing financial
assistance to those individuals infected with
hepatitis C through blood transfusions.  
It is
 important
that we make one matter clear, however.  The Minister
for Health and Community Care has expressed concern
about establishing any principle of awarding
compensation for harm caused by NHS treatment simply
because the treatment carried a risk, and that risk
subsequently crystallised as an
 
injury.  We are 
in 
full
agreement with the minister on this matter."
Then going down to paragraph 91:
"The Committee therefore wishes to stress the
narrowness of the view to which it has come.  We are not
advocating the principle that all injury caused through
NHS treatment should be compensated.  Nor are we asking
the Executive to establish any new, wide-
ranging
precedent on the 
management
 of risk in clinical
decision
-
making.  Instead 
we
 simply seek to correct an
inconsistency in the operation of an already created and
narrow precedent
; 
namely the precedent created when the
Macfarlane Trust was 
set 
up.  We do not envisage 
that
any ad hoc [design] to provide financial or other help
to individuals 
infected
 with hepatitis C 
through
 NHS
treatment, would necessarily require the NHS to change
 

28 July 2022
          
          

  33
any of its current medical policies and practices on
risk arising from treatment."
Then if we go
 -- 
I think we can then pick it up to
page 26.
At paragraph 98:
"We have come to the view that financial and other
practice assistance
, 
awarded on a no-fault basis
, 
is the
clearest solution to the issues raised in these
petitions.  We believe as a matter of fairness that
individuals who have suffered serious, 
long-term
 harm as
a result of NHS treatment should receive some practical
assistance.  We also believe that this solution is
required for reasons of consistency, in recognition of
the fact that HIV sufferers already receive assistance
,
under clearly analogous circumstances
, 
via the
Macfarlane Trust."
Then we can see the recommendations made following
on from that analysis at the bottom of the page
.  
The
first one:
"
1.  
We recommend that the Executive set up
a mechanism for providing financial and other
appropriate practical support to all hepatitis C
sufferers who have contracted the virus as a result of
blood transfusions provided by the NHS in Scotland, or
which involved blood or blood products produced by the
 
34
SNBTS.  [That] support should be available to all such
hepatitis C sufferers whether they are haemophiliacs or
non-haemophiliacs
, 
and it should be available regardless
of whether negligence in the individual case can be
proven
 or not.  It should also be available regardless
of 
[whether] 
the individual became infected with
hepatitis C, although clearly anyone who became infected
after the Consumer Protection Act 1987 came into force,
and who has obtained adequate damages under the Act, or
who has settled adequately with the Executive's lawyers
,
should not also be entitled to further financial
assistance.
"
2.  
We recommend that this mechanism for
providing financial and other support comes into
operation with
in 
a period of 
twelve
 months."
They say at paragraph 3 that:
"
3.  
The level of financial assistance awarded to
any claimant should be determined on the basis of need,
having regard to the physical or psychological loss
individually suffered, and should include redress for
practical difficulties such as the inability to obtain
an affordable mortgage or life assurance."
And:
"
4.  
In determining an appropriate package of
assistance
, 
and in particular in clarifying what
 
35
[
particular
]
 help can be offered, the Executive should
consult hepatitis C sufferers -- both haemophiliac and
non-haemophiliac."

--Result #747--

Then we see
, 
at paragraph 1
, 
the purpose is
:
"
To seek agreement to the Scottish Executive's
formal response to the recommendations made in the
Health and Community Care Committee report, 'Report on
Hepatitis C'."
Then you set out the background to it.
And if we could go over to page 2, under
"Discussion", and look in a little more detail about
what's said there, if we see under the -- if we could
down to the 
bottom
 half of the page
, "
Support for Hep C
sufferers
", 
and it says 
this
:
"
10.  
The Committee claims that it supports of the
general principle of not paying compensation for harm
caused by NHS treatment 'simply because the treatment
carried a risk
'
 ..."
 
and so on.
And then paragraph 11 sets out the Committee's
point on inconsistency that we've just looked
 
at
, 
and
what they say that it would not necessarily require the
NHS to change any of its current medical policies and
 
40
practices on risk arising from treatment.
Then you say this:
"
12.  
This seems a flawed argument.  The decision
to compensate HIV sufferers was taken at a stage when
the full implications were not apparent.  In retrospect
it may not have been a wise move and the Executive and
UK government have consistently argued that it was
a 'special case'.  If Hep C sufferers are also
compensated then it will be very difficult to maintain
the
 '
special case
'
 argument."
Then you say this at paragraph 13:
"
13.  
It now appears to be a fairly regular
occurrence for new diseases to be identified
; 
and for
some of these diseases to have a long latency period.
This has certainly been in the case in the field of
blood transfusion, there is 
no
 reason to believe that
further such diseases will not emerge in the future.
This means that by the time that the responsible agent
has identified
, 
and preventative measures put in place,
some people have suffered serious health impairment.  We
think it would be wrong to create an expectation that
these people would automatically receive compensation
for exposure to an unknown risk for which 
no
preventative measures could be taken.  We believe that
adopting the Committee's first recommend
ation 
would have
 

28 July 2022
          
          

  41
that effect."
Then you go on to say:
"
14.  
Our proposed response to the Committee
therefore rejects these recommendations that propose
financial and practical support for all people who have
contracted 
Hep
 C ... Instead it offers to set up an
expert group to examine 
... 
whether the general
principle of offering such support is a) right, b)
practicable
, 
and if so, what universal criteria could be
applied."
I want to ask you some questions about what you
say first of all in paragraph 13.
Was it your understanding at that time 
that
hepatitis C in the 
'70s
 and 
'80s, 
during the time when
people were being infected
, 
was an unknown risk for
which 
no
 preventative measures could be taken?

--Result #748--

  
And we can see that your proposal to
the
 
Cabinet is to reject the recommendations made by the
Committee and go and get some more assistance from the
expert group
, 
and I'll come on to ask you some more
questions about that in a moment
.
But I think in earlier evidence you suggested that
at the time of receiving this report, you wanted to give
 
47
help and assistance but you were concerned, and I'm
paraphrasing, about the principle 
basis
 upon which you
could do that.
Is it right to understand this note that
,
certainly
 
at this time, 
20
 November, your first few days
in the job, that thinking 
hadn't
 developed to that point
quite yet?  You were saying 
no
 to the recommendation for
any assistance, and "We'll get the expert group to look
at whether, as a matter of principle, there should be
such compensation and
, 
if so
, 
on what basis"?

--Result #749--

Exactly
, 
in terms of financial assistance
.  
Obviously
there were other areas of assistance
, 
which we were
quite happy to advance but it was the specific issue of
what was called compensation or became called
an
 
ex gratia payment.  That was the area that we wanted
to have the expert group look at.
And
, 
of course
 -- 
of course I remind people that
the expert group
, 
and again, totally supported setting
up an
 
expert group, but obviously that was -- that had
already been proposed by Susan Deacon, and I fully
supported that.

--Result #750--

Because we weren't rejecting the case.  We were just
saying that we need to have a sound basis for doing it
.
That was our thinking at the time, as I said, a year and
a bit down the track, we weren't
 
taking the ad hoc
approach.  But
, 
at this stage, with 
thought -- with
hindsight 
we can say, perhaps, we were 
exaggerating the
extent 
to which this was 
would be a 
precedent but it was
commonly believed 
at the time 
in the UK Government, 
the
Scottish Government and 
indeed 
elsewhere
.
So we thought
, 
right, if we are going to chang
e
the
 principle of 
no 
compensation where there is
no fault
, 
we want to do this in accordance with some
equitable system which has clear criteria.  That was the
thinking behind the expert group proposal.  So it was
 
55
not rejecting the idea of compassionate financial
support; it was saying we want to do it in accordance
with some clear framework based on equitable criteria.

--Result #751--

So it's right to understand, then, that your thinking on
receiving this 
report
 was the principle that there
should be a compensation scheme is one that you agree
with.  The question then is
: 
what's the scope?

--Result #752--

I don't think 
we
 would have accepted the word
"compensation
", 
which is why very soon the term
"ex gratia payment" came into play.  But it's fair to
say that there 
was
 still resistance to the almost
universal scope of the report in terms of who should
receive payment, because the thinking in the Executive
at the time was that if you -- it was more looking like
compensation if everybody received the payment
.
So the initial response
, 
and in
 -- 
one 
indeed
which
 
persisted throughout the rest of 2002
, 
was that
payments should go to a subdivision of those people who
had hepatitis as a result of blood products or blood
 

28 July 2022
          
          

  65
transfusions, that it should go to those who were
suffering long-term harm
, 
and various other similar
language was used.  So 
that
 was certainly the response
for most of the period, although that did change in
January of 2003.

--Result #753--

I was just going to go over the page and read
paragraph 47
:
"We were impressed by the fact that the proposal
is 
well
-
grounded in terms of being properly costed and
that a source of funding has been identified.  Careful
consideration has also been given to how the
reallocation should take place and we are of the view
that the DEL capital budget would bear a reduction of 2%
over the 
three
 years of the budget
 
cycle
.  
However
, 
we
do not 
feel
 able to give the proposal our support."
Then they set out the reasons why they are unable
to say what the consequences of agreeing to the proposal
would be, in terms of budgetary consequences, and
an
 
impact on Treasury spend in terms of benefit to
sufferers in the event of any compensation scheme.
 
120
It finishes with this:
"Until these matters are clearer
, 
therefore, the
Committee, while welcoming the precedent set by this
individual proposal for reallocation, cannot progress
this matter at this time."
Now, you've told us that that was an
 
application
that wasn't repeated.  Did you consider making such
an
 
application yourself
?  
Would
 
that have been open to
you?

--Result #754--

Well,
 I mean
, 
my comment at this point would be you can
find all the things I said about Ireland.  I'm not
actually
 saying that I, or the Officials
, 
indeed
, 
got
every -- the language entirely right.  I don't know, you
would have to show me what I 
actually
 said in practice
.
But the fundamental point -- I suppose the difficulty
here is there is a fine line between being found at
fault in a judicial inquiry and being legally liable
because of what a court of law has decided.
And the debate about the Irish scheme is the
difference 
between legal liability and fault
 
but
, 
as far
as we were concerned
 
in Scotland
, 
the fundamental
difference between Scotland and Ireland
, 
was that there
was openly acknowledged fault, 
wasn't 
legal liability
but it was fault, and we -- some people may disagree
with us -- but the reality is our view at that time was
that there was no fault in the same way in Scotland
.
So that was the fundamental difference and all the
examples about the Tribunal
, 
and so on
, 
in Ireland, all
of that was true and there was mention of wrongful acts,
but it wasn't legal liability
.  
But the other thing, and
the documents on this
, 
as all your documents
, 
were
 

28 July 2022
          
          

  129
extremely interesting, but I was particularly struck by
the one from the Ireland Children and Families
 -- 
or it
may have been Children and Education Department, where
it -- it quite clearly said that the original scheme of
compensation in Ireland was because of the -- 
well,
basically it was the infected anti-D immunoglobulin
given to those women and then those women became donors
.  
And
 
it was quite clear in the statement from the
Children and Education Department that that was the
beginning of the scheme
.  
Yes
, 
it was extended to
everybody thereafter, but it 
was 
obvious -- and there
were multiple other faults that were 
delineated, 
it was
because of the various admitted faults in the way it had
been handled in Ireland that they ended up with the
scheme 
they
 did
.
So that was the distinction that I think has got
rather lost in the discussion about this between fault
and legal liability
.  
No
, there was 
no
 legal liability
in Ireland but it's clear from all the -- I think there
were two official inquiries in Ireland
 -- 
that there was
fault, and that was the distinction we were making
between what happened in Ireland
 
and
, 
in
 our 
view
, 
what
happened in Scotland
.
The language we used may not always have been
correct but I think that fundamental distinction still
 
130
stands.

--Result #755--

And if we turn over the page, we can see about a third
of the way down, a quarter of the way down, the Convener
says:
"Are you saying the payments of approximately
£300,000 that are being made in Ireland are being made
because they are prepared to put more money into the
compensation -- or whatever word you would use for it?"
You say:
 
132
"
I am
 glad that you raised that point.  In
Ireland
, 
the Government and everyone else have agreed
that 
wrongful 
practices were used.  The payments in
Ireland were compensation.  We are making 
an 
ex gratia
payment.  I know that certain people are raising
controversy about that
, 
and the Health and Community
Care Committee in the previous session of Parliament did
not, in particular, express a different 
view
.  The
payment that we are making is ex gratia and that is the
difference between Scotland and Ireland.  It is
important that people understand that."
At the point that you made that statement, looking
at -- having seen what your briefing note said about
that, was it your understanding that the payments
followed on from the acceptance of wrongful practice or
the findings of wrongful practice?

--Result #756--

So that's the context in which this email is being
written.
 
134
So if we go to page 2, please
, 
we can see at the
bottom of the page
, 
halfway down, the email from
Bob Stock
, 
18 March 2004, about the Irish Sea
Compensation Tribunal, and then there's
 -- the 
first
paragraph sets out the background that there's been
a discussion by phone and that the tribunal are going to
be asked for some information relating to an article in
the Sunday Herald.
And he says it's difficult to predict exactly what
the Committee will ask for, because it's not clear what
the documentation The Herald article is referring to
.  
And then he says 
this
:
"You will see the controversy revolves around the
fine
 line that can be drawn between being found at fault
in a judicial inquiry and being found legally liable in
a court of law
 ...
"
So that's the point you've just made
.
"
... 
and between the Irish compensation scheme
following swiftly after an adverse finding of the
Inquiry and it being a consequence of it.  We have been
question to use the concept of 'found at fault' rather
than 'legally liable' in making comparisons with the
Irish scheme and to point out that the scheme 
was
 set up
against the background of that Inquiry conclusion 
(
and
the Expert 
Group 
report before it
)
 
- 
without explicitly
 
135
stating that the two things were unconnected or not, but
with the clear inference that we think they may have
been.  Hopefully that 
is 
a correct approach and one that
you will not 
feel
 obliged to explicitly refute in any
way
 -- 
even though the official Irish Government line on
it may approach it from a different angle."
Then it says if you want to discuss do
 "
please
give me a ring".
Just looking at that email, are you concerned that
this -- 
well,
 it could be said that this suggests or
reveals 
that
 officials knew that the payments were not
being made in consequence of the findings of fault, or
the admissions of fault, but were presenting it in such
a way to you so as to invite the person listening to
your answer to draw an inference that the findings of
fault and the payments were connected?

--Result #757--
"
Then you go on to say this:
"The Minister is therefore correct in saying that
the Executive response appears to rule out financial
compensation in the terms suggested by the Committee.
Whilst that may seem a harsh stance, it is justified in
terms of the need to avoid establishing a new
wide-ranging precedent on compensation
 -- 
as detailed in
paragraphs 10-13 of my cabinet minute
 ...
"Whilst I believe 
that 
it is very important to
avoid establishing such a precedent
, 
I 
feel
 the
Executive should explore any other reasonable avenue in
terms of making the life of [such] sufferers less
difficult.  The main issue appears to be mortgages and
insurance and the proposed response therefore suggests
we explore what can be done in this area."
So it's right to understand from this, then, that
 
154
you
 -- 
during your time as a minister, 
no
 attempts were
made, because of the decision that you're here
explaining, to identify any patients who were infected
during that relevant period
, 
so March 
'
88 to
September '91, but who had not instituted proceedings
within the 
ten
 years
, 
to identify those people and make
payments to them
?

--Result #758--

  
Can we turn
, 
first of all
, 
to a document
.
HSOC0003349
, 
and it's page 7.
So I'm about to show you the terms of reference
for the Ross Group, the expert group.  
So 
if we can just
look at that:
"
The
 terms of reference of our Group as given by
the Minister for Health and Community Care and agreed by
the Health and Community Care Committee of the Scottish
Parliament are
: 
 
164
"
To consider circumstances in which a system of
financial and other 
support 
might be available to people
who have been harmed by NHS 
treatment in Scotland in
circumstances where there is unlikely to be liability on
the part of NHS Scotland and to apply general principles
with are consistent, equitable and transparent for all.
"The situation of patients who have contracted HIV
and/or hepatitis C from blood transfusion or treatment
with blood products should form part of the wider
consideration
s
."
So that's the context in which the question is
asked
, 
and the question is this: was the hope that
, 
by
viewing the blood contamination issue within the general
no-fault compensation scheme, the group would rule out
payments to the latter because 
of
 the precedent issue?

--Result #759--

No
, that's the earlier letter.  So this is the letter
which is really
 -- 
from memory, it's asking about both
the devolved powers issue and the 
social security
implications.  But the second letter I think was
18 December
, 
which was
 -- it was 
when we made the shift
and said
 we're now -- 
we'd been advised
, 
although we
haven't
 been keen on lump-sum payments up 
to
 now because
it looked more like compensation
 -- 
I'm saying from
memory
 -- 
but we've been advised that this is more
likely to be allowable under the devolution set-up, and
therefore it was raising that issue.  I think it was
18
 December to Andrew Smith
, 
which was a slightly
different one
.

--Result #760--

As we've got 
this 
on screen
, 
I've got some questions in
relation to this letter
, 
and 
then 
I've found the
 
167
reference to the 18 December letter as 
well,
 so 
we
 can
put that up on screen
.
If we look at this letter, 
so 
this is
5
 
November 2002
: 
"
Financial compensation for victims of
hepatitis C
: 
social security implications.
"
If we can turn over to the second page, the
question is in relation to what's on the second page.
And you say there:
"We have not taken any definite decision but the
scheme that currently looks the most attractive might
involve [I think 
that
 must say] the outlay 
of 
between
£1 and 
£4 million per annum
, 
reflecting 
the
 wide range
of uncertainty about the prognosis for the individuals
involved.  We would expect the monthly payment to the
individuals under the scheme to be in the order of £500
per month."
The question is in two parts.  First of all, what
was the basis of the analysis of making £500 a regular
monthly payment?

--Result #761--

I think then if we just
, 
for the sake of completeness
,
put up the letter of the 18 December 2002, from you to
Andrew Smith, and that's SCGV0000251_043.  If we go over
to the second page, so you say there:
"I understand that officials have had a further
discussions following my letter of 
5 
November, 
and
I thought it 
might 
be helpful to elaborate on the
Executive's thinking in terms of how a scheme 
might
operate."
Then you talk about preference for
:
"... 
a scheme that would make ongoing payments to
surviving
 patients
 -- 
triggered by progression to
a stage of disease that could easily be linked to the
concepts of need and suffering.  We 
feel
 that such
payments would be less likely to be perceived as
compensation
, 
and therefore as being a new departure
from the principle that the 'NHS does not pay
compensation when there is 
no
 legal liability'."
 
170
Then you say this:
"As you know
, 
our
 preliminary view is that any
scheme for making ex gratia payments to this group of
patients would lie within devolved competence.  However,
I understand that there may be an
 
argument that a scheme
based 
on lump-sum payments is less likely to be viewed
as
 involving reserved payments than one based on ongoing
payments.  We believe that a 
lump
 sum payment scheme
would also offer a workable approach to meeting the
needs of this group of people.  If it would help to
address any concerns on devolved competence, we would be
willing to go forward on the basis that any new scheme
would 
only
 involve lump sums."
Is that 
the
 letter you were 
referring
 to?

--Result #762--

Yes
, I mean that was a key turning point and paragraph 2
is 
actually
 quite interesting because I think the
Department all along felt 
--
 were worried about this
 --
we've talked about this before
 -- 
but this idea that
somehow it would be
 -- "
We don't want 
it
 
to
 appear as
compensation
, 
if we give it as a lump sum
" -- 
and then
subsequently the argument became
, "
If we give it to
everybody, it looks like compensation rather than as
relieving suffering
".  
So I think that is 
actually
 quite an
 
interesting
letter in terms of the thinking within the Department
 
171
that
 
I
 
was beginning to 
feel
 a bit uncomfortable about,
because
, 
at the end of the day, I did accept these
arguments about how it was a precedent but
, 
in
retrospective, they were probably overdone because it
was possible to make ad hoc payments, I think, as it
turned out, without it becoming, as far as I can see,
an
 
enormous precedent for lots of other groups of
people.
But they were genuine
ly
 concerns that people had
at the time, so in understanding the thinking of the
Executive and similar thinking in the UK Government,
I
 
think that is quite an
 
important point
.

--Result #763--
 If we can then just pick up Lord Jenkin's evidence to 
the Archer Inquiry.  First of all his written state ment, 
which is ARCH0002968. 
So we can see "Statement by the [Right 
Honourable], The Lord Jenkin of Roding, former Secr etary 
of State for Health & Social Security, 1979-1981".  Now, 
I'm not going to deal with what Lord Jenkin says ab out 
his own time in office but just deal with the issue
about documents. 
Towards the bottom of this page he refers to his 
letter to Lord Warner and Lord Warner's response.  If we 
go over the page we see his comments on the standar d 
lines included in Lord Warner's letter in paragraph  6. 
Then paragraph 7 deals with his account of his meet ing 
with you: 
122 "It was not until the 13th April 2005 that I was 
able to meet Sir Nigel Crisp and put the whole matt er to 
him.  Sir Nigel expressed dismay at the inadequacy of 
Lord Warner's first letter and the terms of the 
background note which had inadvertently been sent t o me, 
and he offered his very sincere apologies for my ha ving 
been treated in this way.  He then went on to expla in 
that there were indeed a large number of files held  at 
the Public Record Office and that it would be neces sary 
for his officials to extract all those files which might 
be relevant to my enquiry.  However, and this was 
perhaps the most important point to emerge from thi s 
meeting, Sir Nigel made it clear to me that all fil es 
that bore upon the issue of contaminated blood prod ucts 
had been destroyed.  He went on to explain that the re 
had been a long process of litigation by and on beh alf 
of HIV sufferers which had culminated in those who were 
identified as having contracted their disease via 
contaminated blood being offered substantial sums o f 
compensation.  He then said that when this litigati on 
had been settled and the compensation paid, it was felt 
by the Department that there was no longer any poin t in 
retaining the files about contaminated blood and th at 
they were accordingly destroyed." 
He then goes on to record his surprise at this and  
123 his difficult in understanding it, and he then says : 
"Sir Nigel could do no more than express his 
regret that this had been done but I was left with 
a clear impression that it had been done with inten t in 
order to draw a line under what was by any standard s 
a health disaster, not only for the Blood Transfusi on 
Service but for the NHS generally." 
Perhaps if I just read the other relevant passages 
of this document and then come back to ask you for any 
reflections you have on it.  If we go over the page , 
paragraph 9, Lord Jenkin records his impression fro m 
a discussion with Mr Connon.  His impression or his
suspicion that Mr Connon might have known more abou t the 
destruction of the files than he was prepared to 
disclose. 
Then if we go to the bottom of the page, 
paragraph 13, we can see in the last few lines 
a reference to Lord Warner in Parliament saying:
"... 'we regret that the papers were destroyed in 
error, which was I think explained to the Noble Lor d in 
a meeting with the former Permanent Secretary ...'. " 
Then over the page Lord Jenkin continues: 
"Since this was most certainly not the explanation 
that had been given to me by Sir Nigel Crisp at the
meeting referred to above, I found the Minister's  
124 answers deeply unsatisfactory." 
Then he describes following it up with further 
questions and communications with Lord Warner.  Tho se 
all post-date your time in office so I don't think we 
need to look further at those. 
So if we go back to page 2, the heart of 
Lord Jenkin's written statement on this issue of hi s 
meeting with you is at paragraph 7. 
We've obviously canvassed this already in the 
questions that I've asked you, Lord Crisp, but is t here 
anything further that you would wish to say in resp onse 
to Lord Jenkin's statement here as to his recollect ion 
of what you'd told him? 

--Result #764--
 There's a reference here, it's about halfway down t his  
128 long paragraph, to you explaining that the litigati on 
had culminated in those who'd contracted HIV from b lood 
being offered substantial sums of compensation.  Wa s 
that your understanding, that substantial sums of 
compensation had been paid? 

--Result #765--
 Um ... well, if I look at these papers, that would be my 
understanding now, wasn't it?  I don't know -- I ca n't 
tell you the exact timing of this.  But I -- there was 
a compensation scheme, wasn't there? 

--Result #766--
 I'm just wondering whether you might have said some thing 
to Lord Jenkin that resulted in him thinking that t here                                   
 
                             29 had been substantial sums of compensation paid?

--Result #767--
 Well, probably.  I mean, I'm sure some of these -- I'm 
sure the discussion was wider than the note shows.  So 
it may have been that -- so when that litigation wa s 
over and there had been some compensation agreed or
a settlement agreed or whatever the language was, a t 
some point after that the files were destroyed.  I mean,
I could clearly have said something like that, but,  you 
know, I really don't know.  I really don't know. 

--Result #768--
 He says: 
"... it was then that Sir Nigel -- and I remember 
his words very clearly, and I quote them in my 
statement ..." 
And then there is the extract from the statement 
we just looked at. 
"And then he said the reason was they had settled 
the HIV cases, compensation had been paid, and that  it 
therefore had not been thought necessary to keep th e  
130 files.  And I rather hung my further thoughts on th at,
that it had been a conscious decision not to keep t he 
files because it was thought there would be no furt her 
purpose." 
Now, again, is it possible that you said something 
about not being thought necessary to keep the files
because the litigation had been settled? 

--Result #769--
 Then the options paper referred to is at 
DHSC0020756_025. 
If we go to page 3, it's just the "for" and 
"against" arguments for a public inquiry I wanted t o 
explore with you.  So this is option 2, "Public Inq uiry, 
lump sum and hardship fund for all haemophiliacs 
infected with Hep C by blood".  I'm not going to as k you 
anything about the lump sum and hardship issues, be cause 
we've explored those with other witnesses in some d epth 
but the "For" argument: 
"Would satisfy lobby.
"Would establish all the facts."  
Now, the "Would establish all the facts" is 
clearly referring there to a public inquiry. 
Then the "Against" arguments, I think the first 
two deal with the issue of financial support, the t hird 
repeats the assertion that: 
"Relevant facts largely established; information 
in the public domain."
The next two points deal with compensation and 
then the last two points in that box deal with the 
public inquiry:  
147 "Lengthy time period for Inquiry to report."
Then this: 
"Public Inquiry would raise the profile of 
potential no-fault compensation at a time when 
litigation in the NHS is an increasing problem." 
Now, I flag that up and just want to tell you 
briefly, in summary forms, evidence that Jeremy Hun t -- 
obviously a rather later Secretary of State for 
Health -- gave to this Inquiry which was to the eff ect 
that his understanding was that the reason not to h old 
the public inquiry was the fear or concern that it would 
lead to the payment of compensation. 
Would that be a proper reason, in your view, not 
to hold a public inquiry, if that were the reasonin g? 

--Result #770--
 Can I then -- you can take that down.
Can I then just ask you a little more generally 
about where there is a long-established departmenta l 
position such as the position in relation to a publ ic 
inquiry, but it might also apply to decisions about  not 
paying for compensation and so on, how can those be  and 
how should they be challenged or reviewed, or 
overturned?  What can be done to prevent something 
having been decided effectively then staying as if 
written in stone?

--Result #771--
 A couple of the witnesses, the ministerial witnesse s who 
have given evidence, have talked about the benefits , as 
they saw it, of a no-fault compensation scheme, and
whether that would assist or promote patient safety . 
Did you have any views on that, drawing on, again, your 
experience both with the NHS and then your shorter 
period of time with the Department?

--Result #772--
 Now I'm going to move now to a different aspect of the 
litigation, and it's the steps taken by the Departm ent 
on receipt of a communication from the judge,                                   
 
                             09 Mr Justice Ognall. 
And just to provide the foundation for the 
questions, if we go to DHSC0046964_024. 
This was the note from Mr Justice Ognall, 
26 June 1990, in which he, as we see from the secon d 
paragraph, invited the parties to "give anxious 
consideration to the prospects of any compromise of
these proceedings".
And he talked about, if we go over the page, in 
the second paragraph, "the plight of the plaintiffs ", 
describing it as a "special one" and observing thei r 
suffering and also their entire blamelessness. 
Then if we go to the next page, we can see,
picking it up in the third line, he says: 
"It might be said that I have raised 
considerations of a political rather than a purely legal 
character.  I acknowledge that.  But I believe that  the 
legal profession has a duty to do its best to see t hat 
legal system does not become a scapegoat in the eye s of 
the public for what I fear may be perceived as the 
unjust and inhumane denial of any significant measu re of 
compensation to the plaintiffs." 
So it may be said he was making a moral case, a
case based upon a humane course, for there to be th e 
payment of a significant measure of compensation to  the  
110 plaintiffs. 
I think from your statement you don't recall you 
yourself having any particular view on the action t aken 
by Mr Justice Ognall.  Did you have any recollectio n of 
what the departmental view or feeling was about thi s 
intervention? 

--Result #773--
 I want to ask you about one point and it may be you
can't assist us but could we go to ARCH0002968, ple ase. 
It's the statement of Lord Jenkin to the Archer Inq uiry 
and it's paragraph 7 on page 2 that I want to pick up 
with you. 
Lord Jenkin explains that it wasn't until 13 April 
that he met Sir Nigel Crisp and put the whole matte r to 
him.  Then, five lines down, he says this: 
"He [Sir Nigel Crisp] then went on to explain that 
there are indeed a large number of files held at th e 
Public Record Office and that it would be necessary  for 
his officials to extract all those files which migh t be 
relevant to my enquiry.  However, and this was perh aps 
the most important point to emerge from this meetin g,
Sir Nigel made it clear to me that all the files th at 
bore upon the issue of contaminated blood products had 
been destroyed.  He went on to explain that there h ad 
been a long process of litigation by and on behalf of 
HIV sufferers which had culminated in those who wer e 
identified as having contracted their disease via  
32 contaminated blood being offered substantial sums o f 
compensation.  He then said that when this litigati on 
had been settled and the compensation paid, it was felt 
by the Department that there was no longer any poin t in 
retaining the files about contaminated blood and th at 
they were accordingly destroyed." 
Do you ever any recollection of anything being 
said in those terms? 

--Result #774--
 Then the next bullet point again really picks up on  the 
issue of resources, and then some issues relating t o the 
current payment schemes, and we'll look at the posi tion 
in relation to the payment schemes I think most 
conveniently by reference to the response to the Ar cher 
Report. 
If we just look at paragraph 18 before we leave 
this document.  It says this: 
"There are a number of examples of countries such 
as France, Ireland and Canada where trials/inquirie s 
have led to large compensation amounts.  The 
circumstances are different as fault was determined ,
though the lobby groups do not make that distinctio n." 
Now, the Inquiry has heard some evidence to 
suggest that a factor in opposing a public inquiry from 
the Department of Health's perspective might have b een 
the fear that it would indeed lead to large compens ation 
payments and a desire to avoid that.  Was that some thing 
which you were conscious of, during your time in of fice? 

--Result #775--
 Sorry, do you mean that the Department was motivate d by 
compensation payments not by -- 

--Result #776--
 And you've said in your statement that you don't th ink 
it was copied to your Private Office.  And then 
Ms Woodeson says this: 
"Well done for getting a submission up so quickly 
on this.  It is frustrating not to be there with yo u to 
help!"
Then she says:  
47 "My reading of Archer's recommendation are that 
..." 
Then I'm not going to read those out.
Next paragraph she says: 
"So on the whole the report looks like something 
we wouldn't want to spend a lot of time on. 
"I would have thought it would be best therefore 
to aim to do only a brief response and get it out a s 
quickly as possible (perhaps in about a month).  Th e 
response should basically:
"- set out our side of the story -- all the steps 
taken to make the blood supply safer as soon as it was 
recognised there was a problem 
"- say we are pleased Archer recognises this (if 
I am right that he doesn't find fault with the Gov 
actions at the time) 
"- set out all the services we provide for 
haemophiliacs and the compensation scheme -- anythi ng 
else positive we can say about what we already doin g 
"- politely reject the specific recommendations 
"- obviously it would be great if we could think 
of something to give them and we will need to think
about that.  The most likely I should think is the free 
prescriptions given ..."
So that view being expressed by Ms Woodeson is  
48 essentially not to devote very much further time to
considering the Archer recommendations.  And that - - you 
didn't see this at the time.  What, if anything, wo uld 
you have to say about it, looking at it now? 

--Result #777--
 Well, it's almost as -- again, I thank you for the 
opportunity to be able to talk about it.  And it's that 
famous saying which haunts me: don't shoot the 
messenger.  And in so many ways when people are 
uncomfortable with the establishment, the medical 
profession, the Government, when they're uncomforta ble 
that there are no solutions then surely the drive s hould 
be to find solutions in an open society and not jus t 
close ranks and think: well, we'll cover that up an d 
hope it goes away. 
And in what happened -- I mean, the whole 
responsibility -- that this Inquiry has already, un der 
your directorship, allowed very speedy compensation ;
there's no compensation for a lost life in terms of
cash.  The thing that a journalist would hope for, and 
I'm sure the people who have been affected, and an open 
society, is about changing this and learning from t he 
mistakes of the past and being open about that proc ess,
and understanding how we could do better next time and 
the next time, post-Covid, the next thing that we f ace, 
rather than thinking: well, we're not sure about th e 
solutions yet and we'll just, actually, as I said,  
72 corral everything and when we've worked out what to  do,
we'll let you know.  We're all involved. 

--Result #778--

  
Okay.  I'm not 100 per cent sure
,
I have got to be honest.  But
, 
you know
, 
on one of
those few occasions when Northern Ireland has
a
 functioning Assembly, there was 
a
 Health Minister,
Michelle O'Neill, and I remember reading something
online
 
that 
within Northern Ireland they were looking
at some compensation or recognition of people who had
been infected by so-called contaminated infected
blood
.  
And
, 
again
, 
up until that point, let's say
within the media, I hadn't heard of this at all
, 
and
it was only then that I
'd 
spoke with my mother and
 
44
said
, "
Listen, remember what was spoken all those
years 
ago
, 
that my dad received this blood which
Dr Kettle believed was infected from the surgery in
1981.  Let's get some details on the Skipton Fund and
make 
an
 application
"
.

--Result #779--

  
I don't.  I mean
, 
I think the main points I wanted
to make through this were that it is not the
 
143
rejection.  
You know, 
when there isn't the evidence --
I don't know for a fact that I had 
a
 blood
transfusion
.  
Nobody knows that
.  
And so there has to
be 
a
 tolerance set somewhere or else anybody could
write in and say
, "
Give me compensation
, 
I have HCV
"
.
There has to be 
a
 tolerance set somewhere
.  
But in
light of the fact that everybody's data has been
destroyed, everybody's records have been destroyed,
that tolerance doesn't seem to be -- and whether this
is down to what Sir Brian said earlier on about
Skipton's claim to lack of funding, whether it is down
to lack of funding or whatever, it doesn't 
feel t
o me
like 
there 
i
s due diligence 
around the process.
There's been no effort made to fully understand the
injuries 
or the conditions that so
me of the other
panel described earlier on.
I mean
, 
I was quite frankly shocked by the level
of evidence that some of the panel earlier today had,
way in excess of mine, and they still got rejected.
I was listening to them thinking
,
 well
,
 how on 
earth
can they be rejected?  It is obvious that they had
transfusions within that time frame
.  
And I would
have -- if they had explored the injury, taken my
testimony about the severity of the injury, spoken to
paediatric orthopaedic surgeons and got testimony from
 
144
them
, 
and they
'd come back 
and said
, "
No
, 
you wouldn't
have had 
a
 transfusion
",
 I would have said
, "
Okay
,
maybe I didn't
",
 and I would have felt like it had
been taken seriously, thoroughly examined and reached
a
 logical, professional conclusion.
That's what I would have expected from 
a
 fit for
purpose support scheme.

--Result #780--

  
Sir
, 
the last document 
we looked
 
at 
on the
introduction of HTLV-III screening was from March 1985
and it was that ministerial submission.  I'm going to
move forward to late June 1985
, 
when a further update,
 
95
albeit a brief one, was provided to the Minister
.
We can see that in the following document
,
SCGV0001146_042
.
20 June 1985
, 
again from Mr Davies to the Private
Secretary to Mr MacKay.  We can see from the first
paragraph that it's prompted by a recent DHSS press
notice in response to an article
:  
"
Mr MacKay will wish to see the attached DHSS
Press Notice
.  
It was 
issued
 yesterday in order to
refute
 a report in the Guardian that one particular test
[
for HTLV-III screening
]
 had already been chosen and was
about to introduced."
 
And in the second paragraph:
"The SNBTS are taking steps to ensure that the
test will be introduced in Scotland as quickly as
possible, 
once
 the evaluations have been completed and
facilities for suitable confirmatory tested are
available
.
  We are not convinced that the DHSS timetable
is achievable
, 
but the intention is that routine testing
should start at the same time throughout the
United Kingdom."
Now
, 
I don't need to go to the press notice but
,
as 
a 
summary
, 
on the timetable, what it says in the
press notice is that the DHSS hopes to introduce routine
screening in four to five months' time.
 
96
So that will take us to about October/November
.
And that's what Mr Davies appears to be suggesting might
not be achievable, and then the final important point to
pick up from this document is:
"
... 
the intention 
... 
that routine testing should
start at the same time throughout the United Kingdom."
The following months show that SNBTS and 
SHHD
officials began discussing and referring to 
an
anticipated start date for screening of October 1985.
There are also further repeated references in the
documents to the simultaneous introduction of screening
throughout the United Kingdom.
In terms of ministerial involvement, and to round
off the picture on this topic, I'm going to move forward
to 20 September 1985 
with 
one more document
,
PRSE0001516
.
This a further submission to the Minister copied
to the Secretary of State.  It's dated 20 September 1985
and it comes from Mr Liddle.  It addresses a number of
different topics relate
d
 to AIDS.  The one which is of
interest to us is over the page under the heading
"
Blood Tests
"
,
 paragraph 6
.  
I'm not going to go through
the whole of this paragraph
.
  I'd highlight the first
sentence in particular
.  
It says:
"Since AIDS can be transmitted through transfusion
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  97
of blood or blood products from an infected donor,
arrangements
 have been made 
to screen all 
blood
donations as from mid
 
October."
There is then mention of 
alternative testing
facilities, confirmatory 
testing 
facilities
, 
and
funding
, and 
then the final sentence in this paragraph:
"The commercially available test kits for the
detection of 
HTLV-III 
antibody have been evaluated by
a pan
el
 of experts from the Public Health Laboratory
Service on behalf of the DHSS and we have made a summary
of the results 
available to Health Boards."
Now
, 
that would appear to be the key documents
during the course of 1985 that seek to involve ministers
in these decisions and to inform them both 
that 
an
evaluation programme were to take place, the anticipated
timing of the introduction of HTLV-III screening, and
that it was intended for screening to be introduced
throughout the United Kingdom simultaneously.
Now
, 
a press release was 
sub
sequently issued on
the introduction of screening from mid-October 1985.
We've summarised its contents in the written note.
A bit faster than ten minutes in the end sir, but
that was all I inten
d
 to cover on the HTLV-III
screening
, 
and I am going to move on to a new topic now,
which is the Department's knowledge of and response to
 
98
the risk of non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis, and hepatitis C.
Now
, 
the Inquiry has previously heard
a significant amount of evidence on these areas,
particularly on surrogate screening, that includes the
evidence of Dr McClelland, it also includes the evidence
of witnesses like Mr Macniven.  I am not going to cover
surrogate screening in a great deal of detail.  I'm
going to attempt to highlight in particular documents
that relate to the Department's understanding of the
risks posed by non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis, dividing the
period up roughly to pre-1986 and post-1986.
I start with pre-1986
.
Relatively little evidence is available in the
documents on the Department's understanding of non-A,
non-B hepatitis before that period, about the mid-1980s.
Most of the available documents relate to officials
attending meetings or working groups.
One example that we've highlighted in the note is
from 6 March 1980
.  
It's a meeting of the re
convened
advisory group on hepatitis B testing, that meeting was
attended by Dr Bell
.  
During the course of it there was
reference made to work by the Medical Research Council
on non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis.  The minutes record that:
"Members were concerned about the 
incidence
 of
non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis and the possibility that new
 
99
viruses were perhaps being introduced through the use of
commercial blood products
, 
namely Factor VIII and
Factor IX."
So linking non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis to factor
concentrates
.
The minutes add that
:
"Members agree that the hazard from
non-A, non-B hepatitis should now be recognised and
brought to the attention of the appropriate departmental
bodies responsible for control of hepatitis."
 
The following year, 1981, another meeting
highlighted in the written note which took place on
25 June 1981, there was a meeting of the MRC's Blood
Transfusion Research Committee attended by Dr Bell.
During that meeting, Dr Gunson described the work of the
Working Party on Post-transfusion Hepatitis.
The minutes record that Dr Gunson reported that
reach was being carried out into identifying the agents
of non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis
, 
that that was complex
research
.  
And perhaps significantly, Dr Gunson noted
during that meeting that
:
 
"
... 
large
-
pool blood products were especially
likely to cause liver damage in haemophiliacs."
One more document from the first half of the 1980s
that I would highlight is from 23
 
May 1984
.  
It's from
 
100
Dr Bell to Mr Murray, so an internal departmental
document.  It's about funding for heat treatment of
Factor VIII at PFC
, 
and it will probably be 
easiest
 if
I 
bring it
 up
.  
It's PRSE0004029.
As we can see
, 
it's a minute from Dr Bell to
Mr Murray, May 1984
, 
and if we go into the second
paragraph, which is in the context of an application for
funding for heat treatment, Dr Bell said:
"At present nearly all 
'
virgin
'
 
(
newly
-
treated
)
haemophiliacs 
become
 infected with
non-A, non-B hepatitis, though not usually of dramatic
severity.  About 40% show evidence of infection by
hepatitis B.  The longer term effects of such infection
in haemophiliacs is not known with certainty because
until relatively recent years haemophiliacs had little
prospect of living into middle or old age.  However
a significant proportion of 'normal' patients infected
with hepatitis B go on to suffer severe liver impairment
which, apart from the personal aspect, makes significant
demands on health care resources."
Now
, 
that's referring both to impact from
hepatitis B and non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis.  I flag it as
one of the documents we have
, 
which are relatively few
,
providing insight into the Department's understanding of
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  101
non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis in the first half of the 1980s.
From around late 1985, the evidence we have
relating to this issue becomes closely linked to the
question of whether or not surrogate screening for
non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis and surrogate screening of blood
donors should be introduced in Scotland.
We're finished with that document
, 
thanks.
The official at the Department who seems to have
been most involved with this topic was Dr Forrester
.
Dr Forrester replaced Dr Bell in 1985.
In March 1986, Dr Forrester attended an
SNBTS
 
directors meeting at which this issue, the
possibility of surrogate screening for non-A,
non-B hepatitis, was discussed.  He prepared a note of
the meeting for his departmental colleagues, 
sent
 it to
Dr McIntyre and Dr Scott shortly afterwards.
I should say that Dr Forrester's notes of
meetings
, 
such as this one of SNBTS directors
, 
often
provide useful insight into his thinking around this
issue in the years that 
we're 
looking at.  I won't go
into the document, this one, but I'm going to go to some
later ones.
In this one, which is from March 1986,
Dr Forrester described non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis as
a medley of conditions.
 
102
He wrote that:
"
... 
any additional test 
[
like surrogate
screening
]
 
... 
must necessarily be non-specific and
could 
well
 prove expensive
 ...
"
He said that he'd made further enquiries and
discovered that the number of cases of non-A,
non-B hepatitis due to blood transfusion in Scotland was
probably exceedingly low.
He referred to a PhD thesis, and we'll come on in
a moment to which thesis that was.
He also reported that 
it had
 been argued by
directors at the meeting that urgent action was required
with respect to surrogate screening for non-A,
non-B hepatitis
, 
and that the case was comparable with
that of AIDS.
Dr Forrester said that he challenged this
comparison on the basis that the steps taken to deal
with AIDS were taken in a face of a rapidly rising
inciden
ce
 whereas the inciden
ce 
of non-A,
non-B hepatitis as far as he knew, was small and steady.
He said there was 
no
 justification for panic measures
and that there might be a justification for research,
rather than what he described as panic measures
.
Now
, 
the thesis referred to by Dr Forrester was by
Dr Dow, 
and 
was 
earned 
at the University of Glasgow
 
103
in
 
1985.  It relate
d
 to research into non-A,
 
non-B
hepatitis
 
in the West of Scotland under the supervision
of Dr Mitchell and Dr Follett
, 
and Dr Forrester obtained
a copy of that thesis.
W
e can see how it informs Dr
 Forrester's
understanding of non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis in a document
from June 1986
.  
I'm going to go to that now.
It's PRSE0000857.
Now
, 
this
 document is dated 12 June 1986.  It's
a note prepared by Dr Forrester
 
titled
:
"Transmission of non-A, non-B hepatitis by blood
and blood products
: 
is it practicable to reduce or
prevent it by introducing ALT testing of donations?"
ALT testing of donations
, 
I'm sure that everyone
who has followed the Inquiry will be familiar with
, 
is
one of the methods by which you carry out the surrogate
screening for non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis.
Now
, 
in the first paragraph Dr Forrester recorded
.
"
1.  
The information in this note is 
mostly
derived from the 
PhD
 thesis entitled
:
'Non-A, non-B Hepatitis in the West Scotland
', 
completed
in 
1985
 by Dr B
C
 
Dow
 under the supervision of Dr Follett
and others."
If we look at paragraph 
4
, 
we
 can see
Dr Forrester's description of non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis.
 
104
He says:
"
... 
it is not uncommon in the population
 ..."
The 
suggestion of an 
incidence
 in Scotland of 184
cases per year
, 
but a suggestion that might not be
a reliable figure.
"It is common among drug
-
abusers
.
"
And then:
"
But 
in association with blood transfusion it is
very uncommon in the west of Scotland.  Over the last
8
 years
, 1-5
 cases are found each year there
, 
and there
is 
no
 upward trend.  There are peculiar difficulties in
identifying its presence in haemophiliacs since their
blood exhibits diverse reactions because of repeated
administration of blood products, but 
Dr
 Dow found 
no
evidence of any substantial problem.  Dr Dow recons that
the proportion of donations infected with
non-A, non-B hepatitis may be 18 per hundred thousand."
He goes on to discuss the merits of surrogate
screening before concluding in the last paragraph that
Dr Dan Reid and Dr Follett do not recommend the
introduction of ALT testing of Scottish blood donations,
for reasons he describes in the note.
Now
, 
over the months that followed and during
further meetings attended by departmental officials,
there appears to have been an increasing emphasis on the
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  105
need to carry out further research before additional
consideration 
could
 be given to whether or not to
introduce surrogate screening.
This issue was also 
considered
 in Scotland
alongside consideration elsewhere, 
for example,
 in the
reconvened UK Working Party on Transfusion Associated
Hepatitis.
We can see Dr Forrester referring to some of these
issues in January 1987 at PRSE0001376.
Now
, 
this is dated 26 January 1987
.  
We can see at
the top 
its
 title
,
 "Material for PMO Report"
.
This morning I 
described
 one of the means by which
Dr Macdonald said that the 
C
MO and DCMO were kept up to
date with what was happening amongst medical officials
in the Department, described monthly PMO reports.  We
don't have those reports but this 
look
s
 like
a contribution to one such report prepared by
Dr Forrester.
If we go down to the second half of this document,
at 
paragraph 2
:
"Blood transfusion and non-A, non-B Hepatitis
(Dr Forrester)"
This is how he describes the condition:
"This 
'
hepatitis
'
 is a residual rag-bag when
Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A are excluded
, 
and
 
106
consequently 
no
 specific test can detect it.  It is
relatively benign.  But US blood banks have noted that
the combination of a 
liver
 function test and a test for
the core
 (
not the surface) antigen of Hepatitis B
distinguishes perhaps a third blood donations which
would convey non-A, non-B 
'
Hepatitis
'
 and allows them to
be excluded.  Exclusion 
is 
far from complete
, 
and
besides, some 2% of 'innocent'
 
donations may also be
excluded
.
"Nevertheless, US blood banks are evidently about
to adopt this pair of tests and shoulder the expense.
Here
, 
it is intended instead to enquire into the number
of relevant donations and the characteristics of the
donor, before taking any further step."
So now 
no
 doubt you may wish to consider and hear
submissions on the characterisation of non-A,
 
non-B
hepatitis 
that we see in this document
 
in particular,
the 
suggestion that it's relatively benign and how that
falls to be considered alongside all of the other
evidence the Inquiry has heard about non-A,
non-B hepatitis.
The final sentence I've highlighted here picks up
the view that further research needed to be undertaken
before any decisions could be made about the
introduction of surrogate screening.  So that's
 
107
January 1987.
In March 1987, 
on 
3
 
March of that year, a meeting
of SNBTS directors took place.  It was attended by
Dr Forrester.  The minutes of that meeting record that
the directors
, 
following a discussion, decided to
recommend to the SHHD that non-A,
 
non-B surrogate
screening should be introduced in Scotland
.  
I won't go
to the minutes 
today
 but what they record is the
following recommendation:
"To recommend to the SHHD that surrogate testing
for 
[
non-A, non-B
]
 should be implemented with effect
from 1
 
April 1988 as a national development requiring
strictly new funding."
That was a meeting attended by Dr Forrester.
Dr McIntyre picked up on this recommendation in
a minute to departmental colleagues on 6 April 1987.
I won't go to the document but he summarises the
background.  Dr McIntyre wrote that
 
in the USA
: 
"... 
largely one suspects because of the fear of
litigation, there
 has 
been a great deal of pressure to
introduce this indirect screening for
'
Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis
'
 
... 
we understand this is
likely to happen soon.  A similar situation is said to
exist in Germany."
He added that the directors of the SNBTS were
 
108
"
unanimous
" 
and that they were 
"
pressing fairly
strongly
"
 that this screening should be instituted in
Scotland
, 
while adding that
 
the directors were
:
"... 
perfectly aware 
that it would be costly and
could not abolish transmission completely, they could
then claim to have taken all steps open to them to
reduce transmission.  Before embarking on such an
expensive programme it would seem logical to participate
in 
the proposed research [that was discussed elsewhere
in the document] and to delay any further action until
the results of this were known."
What we see around this time, and later into 1987
is some uncertainty around Scottish participation in
a proposed UK study of non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis.  As well
as a concern in the Department that the SNBTS directors
might simply begin surrogate screening without direct
SHHD authorisation.
We move into 1988.  By this point little progress
seems to have been made on the introduction of surrogate
screening, or on decisions about the introduction of
surrogate screening.  Despite some of those departmental
fears, SNBTS directors did not in fact introduce
screening unilaterally.
By the time that we get to a 12 April 1988 meeting
of SNBTS directors, attended by Dr Forrester, there was
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  109
a suggestion that directors were already undertaking
their own research on this issue leaving open the
possibility that they might introduce surrogate
screening in the future
, 
and the minutes include the
following, and this passage is particularly relevant to
the relationship between decisions in Scotland and
decisions in the rest of the UK
:
"
... 
it was confirmed that it had been agreed not
to introduce ALT testing in Scotland until it 
had
 
become
UK
 
policy
, but
 Directors wish
ed
 to reserve their
position on this matter in the light of reports at the
commencement of ALT testing in at least one 
[
England and
Wales
]
 RTC."
Now
, 
by the time we get to later in 198
8, the
question of whether to introduce surrogate screening for
non-A,
 
non-B hepatitis in Scotland became interlinked
with and was eventually overtaken by developments
related to the discovery of the hepatitis C virus, and
I'm going to turn to that issue now.
That was a fairly quick move through, sir, the
evidence that we have relating to
non-A, non-B hepatitis.  There is, as ever, more detail
contained in the written note.
Now hepatitis C screening.
The chronology and our understanding of this
 
110
section might conveniently be thought of to begin with
the announcement in May 1988 that the 
Chiron 
Corporation
in the USA had discovered the non-A, non-B hepatitis
virus
, 
which of course became known as hepatitis C
.
It appears that departmental officials became
aware of this discovery by at least June 1988 through
their attendance at meetings of SNBTS directors.
Soon 
thereafter an important development in this
chronology is the creation around late 1988 and early
1989 of two Advisory Committees which worked at
UK
 
level: the Advisory Committee on the Virological
Safety of Blood, ACVSB, and the Advisory Committee on
Transfusion Transmitted Diseases, ACTTD.
Both of those 
committees played an important role
in considering the introduction of hepatitis C
screening.  
The written note makes brief reference to
their creation
.  
Their deliberat
ions 
have been
considered previously by the Inquiry.  I'm only going to
refer very briefly to the outcome of some of their
meetings
.
A point to note for our purpose is that
departmental officials attended meetings of the ACVSB as
observers.  It was usually Dr McIntyre who 
attended
those meetings in this period.  Officials don't seem to
have attended meetings of the ACTTD.
 
111
Now
, 
as hepatitis 
C 
screening was considered by
officials in the Department from 
early 
1989
, one 
of the
issues that emerges is the relationship between
a decision to be taken in Scotland on both the principle
and timing of the introduction of screening, and
decisions taken elsewhere in the UK.  What we see in the
documents from 1989 are a number of references to
a UK-wide approach to the introduction of screening.
One example of that sort of reference is in an
August 1989 letter from Dr McIntyre to Professor Cash,
which made reference to the work of the ACVSB, and in
which Dr McIntyre wrote:
"If it is considered desirable to introduce
a further routine screening test for blood donors [ie,
the screening test] I understand that this will be done
simultaneously throughout the UK
 -- 
as was done in the
case of the current HIV test."
I note that at this stage, that policy decision,
if it can be described in that way, didn't yet seem to
have been put to ministers in the Scottish Office.
I can turn to what seems to be the first time that
officials bring this issue to the attention of ministers
in the Scottish Office, in the summer o
f
 1989.
It's the document at PRSE0000558
.
Now
, 
this is a minute prepared by Mr Tucker
, 
who
 
112
replaced Mr Macniven 
as
 Assistant Secretary in the HHD,
directed to Mr Forsyth
, 
the Private Secretary to
Mr Forsyth.  We can see what's prompted this document in
the first paragraph.
"This note is to advise the Minister about an
article in today's Guardian [attached is a copy] 
...
which seems likely to prompt other media enquiries."
I note at this stage in parentheses, earlier on
this morning 
we looked at Mr Murray's description of
some of the factors or circumstances which might lead to
ministers being updated or informed of 
developments
, he
included media interest or media articles
, 
and this
seems to be an example of that happening.
Now, Mr Tucker set out the background to this
issue in the first few paragraphs.  I'm not going to go
through all of that now.  I'm going to pick up in
paragraph 4 his description of the effect of infection
with hepatitis C.
"Only a minority of those infected with HP
C
[ie 
hepatitis C
] 
display any symptoms either in the
short or long term
 ...
"
It suggests that the way this point had been
described in The Guardian article was unnecessarily
alarmist.
Over the page, there's reference to the work of
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  113
the ACVSB.  In paragraph 7 Mr Tucker wrote that:
"The accuracy of the test for hepatitis C 
has
 not
been fully established
 ...
"
Describes further work which was considered to be
essential to be undertaken
.  
And then finally, the line
to take.
"If asked to comment 
it is
 suggested that the
Minister uses the following:
"(a) 
Donors should not be deterred from giving
blood."
It highlights entry (d):
"The prevalence of HP
C
 in the population in this
country has not been established, nor has the role of
blood in its transmission."
Finally:
"This is a UK issue and D of H [Department of
Health] will be 
taking
 the lead but SHHD and SNBTS will
be represented in any meeting and the Minister will be
consulted before any decisions are taken."
Now
, 
over subsequent months the introduction of
hepatitis C screening was 
considered
 at meetings 
of
those two committees I mentioned earlier, ACVSB and
ACTTD
.  The 
Department 
was
 kept informed of their
deliberations
, in particular 
from 
Dr McIntyre's
attendance that the 
ACVSB 
meetings.
 
114
I've highlight
ed
 one of those meetings
, it's
referred to in 
the 
note
, 
on 
1
7 January 1990
 
when the
minutes of the ACVSB record a general consensus that
routine testing should not be introduced in advance of
an FDA decision on whether to licence this particular
hepatitis C screening test.  It was suggested that
scientifically
 not enough is known yet about the
screening test to justify its introduction.
One more document involving ministers from around
this time
, 
SCGV0000230_145.
Now
, 
this is from 
1
 February 1990.  It's a minute
to the Private Secretary to Mr Forsyth, copied to the
Secretary of State
.  
As will be apparent from the title
it is primarily concerned with a different issue which
we'll co
me 
back to later.  If you go over -- sorry
, 
not
over the page, to the bottom of this page, please.
There's discussion of challenges from a budgetary
perspective facing the Department and
, 
in that context,
brief reference to the possible introduction of
hepatitis C screening
:
"
All budgets are likely to be very tight next
year
 ..."
The CSA budget was 
described
 as
:
"... 
likely to come under severe pressure from
a 
number of sources which were not foreseen at the time
 
115
of framing bids
 
for 
[
the budget
].  (
Eg
 
the prospect of
a 
two year settlement for pay of ambulance staff and the
introduction of routine blood testing for Hepatitis C
which is expected to 
become
 unavoidable following expert
advice that such testing should be introduced in order
to prevent the risk of future claims against the
Government similar to those now pending in respect of
haemophiliacs with HIV.)"
So that's February 1990.  I'm going to move
forward to mid-1990
, 
when officials in the Department
became aware that the FDA had approved hepatitis C
testing, had granted a licence for a screening test
.  
In response to that, a meeting of the ACVSB was
brought forward.  We can get some insight into
Dr McIntyre's view of that development in this document
.
It's PRSE0003099.
So this is a 6 June 1990
 
minute from Dr McIntyre
to Dr Young, copied to colleagues in the Department,
including Mr Tucker
, 
headed "Hepatitis C Testing".
If we 
zoom
 in on the first half of the page,
Dr McIntyre reported:
"Things are moving very fast on the Hepatitis C
front.  The FDA have now approved the Hepatitis C
antibody test.  Until this approval was given in the
country in which the test originate
d
 the Advisory
 
116
Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood was
reluctant to recommend 
its
 introduction in the
United Kingdom.  It was agreed at the last meeting that
there should be a study to investigate the significance
of positive finding
 
using the ELISA Hepatitis C antibody
screening tests followed up with an extended study of
RIBA and PCR techniques."
We then can see the paragraph towards the bottom
of th
is 
current view:
"I am in little doubt that for a variety of
reasons, many of them non-scientific, it will be decided
that there is 
no
 alternative but to recommend the
introduction of the test."
If we go down to the bottom of this page,
Mr Tucker -- sorry, not Mr Tucker, Dr McIntyre wrote:
"As you will remember
 
one of the problems in the
litigation in relation to HIV infection of haemophiliacs
is whether or not the HIV testing was introduced as
early as 
was 
possible.  Although Hepatitis C is not such
a fatal condition as HIV infection litigation would be
possible if a patient was subsequently to determine that
he had been transfused with Hepatitis C positive
blood
 -- 
or blood which had not been tested for
Hepatitis C antibodies.  It is of course well known that
there are many patients who suffer from Hepatitis C who
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  117
never have blood transfusions.  The whole issue is
something of a minefield."
Now, the
 ACVSB meeting which was brought forward
in response to the FDA announcement took place on
2
 
July 1990.  It 
was
 attended by Dr McIntyre.  As will
be familiar to the Inquiry, it was recommended, or
rather it was agreed at that meeting to recommend
hepatitis C screening to ministers after a pilot study
to determine whether one of two tests, 
the
 Ortho or the
Abbott test, was most suitable for use in Regional
Transfusion Centres
, 
and the 
estimated 
time
scale 
for
study was around four months
.
  That's July 1990.
If we move forward to November 1990, Dr McIntyre
attends another meeting of the ACVSB.  He prepares
a note of the meeting and circulates it to colleagues in
the Department.  In that note there's some discussion of
possible start dates for hepatitis C screening.
Dr McIntyre's note of the meeting recorded that
some attendees wanted testing to start 
forth
with, while
the Chair of the Committee was said to have suggested
that 1
 
April 1991 might be more realistic.
Dr McIntyre also suggested that the Department
should wait to receive a draft submission being prepared
by the Department of Health.  So we see in 
that
November 1990 note, reference to a possible start date,
 
118
1
 
April 1991.
Now
, 
the DoH submission was finalised and put to
ministers in England and Wales on 21 December 1990
.  
It
was copied to the SHHD.  That submission recommended the
introduction of hepatitis C screening.  It recorded that
other UK Health Ministers were being asked to approve
the introduction of screening in their transfusion
services.  So that's December 1990
.  
As we'll see, and
this is to jump ahead, the submission which went to
ministers in Scotland on this particular issue, and
addressing it directly, didn't go in until Ju
ly
 1991.
So December 1990 the DoH submission is made.  The
departmental officials in Scotland had 
become
 aware
of it by January 1991.  They also became aware that
ministers in the Department of Health 
had
 given their
approval to the introduction of hepatitis C screening.
Officials in Scotland then began considering
a submission to their own ministers.
As I've said, that submission was not
eventually -- was not put in until July 1991.  What we
see over the months between January 1991 and July 1991
is what appears to be an awareness amongst officials in
the Department of the start date, the proposed start
date
, 
for routine screening of hepatitis C being pushed
back.
 
119
It seems that around late February 1991, following
an ACVSB meeting, officials in the Department came to
understand that 
the
 likely start date for screening was
being pushed back from 1 April to 1 July 1991.
It appears that by late March, they became aware
of a suggestion that that 1 July date might be pushed
back again.  We can see an example of that in a letter
from Professor Cash
, 
which is at PRSE0003692
, 
dated
27 March 1991.  It's a letter from Professor Cash to
Mr McIntosh
, 
who I understand was 
a 
general manager of
the SNBTS at the time.
If we go over the page we can see the letter was
copied to Dr McIntyre in the Department.
Professor Cash wrote, and if we can go back to
page 1
, 
please:
"You will want to know that our NBTS colleagues
are struggling
, 
on a number of accounts
, 
to meet the
1st 
July deadline
, 
as previously discussed and I thought
agreed.  We believe the fundamental problem is one of
financial resourc
ing
.
"
At a meeting of the UK BTS Advisory Committee on
Transfusion Transmitted Diseases in Manchester [the
previous Monday
], the 
following was agreed:
"
(a) 
Harold Gunson would advise DoH that the
1st
 
July start date should be delayed until such time as
 
120
an evaluation of the new generation of HCV screening
tests had been complete
d
.  If this is accepted it could
push a start date to September."
So
me
 more material
, I know, sir, 
related to these
developments and the introduction of new second
generation screening tests will have been 
considered
 by
the Inquiry previously.  We can see here the officials
in the HHD becoming aware
 -- 
being made aware of these
developments.  I'm also going to try to decipher
, 
in the
top right-hand corner
, 
a manuscript note, which seems to
be between two officials in the HHD.  I believe it
'
s
from
 Mr Panton to Mr Hogg, dated 2 April 1991.
"This is worrying.  
[
Please
]
 speak to DoH.  We
can't go to the Minister until we know the start date"
.
Now
, 
a number of other documents which are
summarised in the written note suggest that officials in
the Department continue to monitor the position in the
Department of Health and developments in the ACVSB over
subsequent months.  It became apparent that 
the 
start
date was in fact pushed back to 1 September 1991.
Now
, 
the extent to which officials in the
Department considered proposing an earlier start date to
Scottish ministers is unclear from the available
documents.  We have some evidence, some of which I've
just pointed to, of officials becoming aware of
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  121
proposals and an agreement to push the start date back.
What we don't seem to have clearly from the
documents is the extent of any thinking about whether
officials should go to ministers in Scotland to say
,
"
The start dates have been pushed back, would you like
to make a decision about whether to introduce screening
earlier in Scotland than the rest of the UK?
"
We
, 
in fact
, 
have couple of documents from
July 1991 which suggest that Dr McIntyre thought it
might be possible that the start date would be pushed
back further from September 1991.  We can see that in
a letter that Dr McIntyre wrote to Dr Metters to his
,
I 
believe
, 
DCMO in the Department of Health.  The letter
was prompted by an article that had been published in
the British Medical Journal about sexual transmission of
hepatitis C
.  
Dr McIntyre explained in the letter that
he thought that 
might 
lead to difficulties around
counselling of patients who tested positive for
hepatitis C, enquired whether that might have an effect
on the September start date and whether it might be
pushed back
.
I'm going to look at Dr Metters' response to that
letter.  It's at PRSE0001103
, 
so 11 July 1991, from
Dr Metters to Dr McIntyre.
I only need to summarise very briefly the contents
 
122
of the letter
 
in essence
 
towards the bottom of the page.
Dr Metters says that it was thought unlikely that this
recent article that had been published would have an
impact on the September 1991 start date
.
  But if we go
up the page to the manuscript notes which seem to be
between officials in the Department, it says:
"We can now proceed with the Hep C submission
.  
We
must get it up this week before Recess."
So it appears to suggest a belief that it was
necessary to get an answer to Dr McIntyre's letter
before finalising and putting a submission to ministers
in Scotland.
Now
, 
that submission was finalised and put to
Mr Forsyth
, 
as he then was
, 
on 24 July 1991.  I'm not
going to go 
to
 
it
.  It was considered in Lord Forsyth
's
evidence
.  
The URN for those who would wish to have it to
hand is PRSE0004608.
That submission recommended that hepatitis C
testing of blood donations be introduced in Scotland
from 1 September 1991, after setting out some of the
arguments for and against screening.
Lord Forsyth accepted that recommendation, 
asked
that 
a press release be prepared to announce it.  That
press release was issued by the Scottish Office on
 
123
2
 
September 1991
 
to announce the introduction of
hepatitis C screening in Scotland.
Now
, 
again
, sir, I've
 move
d
 fairly quickly through
that
 material.  As ever
, 
there's more in the written
note.  That all I inten
d 
to say for the moment about the
introduction of hepatitis C screening in Scotland.
The next topic which comes up for those following
using the written note is prisons.  It's a very short
section
.  
There's not a great deal in there.  I'm going
to suggest that those who are interested
 
in reading more
about that topic look at the written note and I'm going
to move 
to
 
a
 final set of issues/topic for 
today
:
compensation, litigation, and financial support.
Now
, 
I can pick up the chronology on these issues
in early 1987, when the Department became aware of calls
for the Government to compensate haemophilia patients
who had been infected with HIV blood products.
The documents suggest that at this stage,
early
 
1987, officials in the Department were emphasising
the importance of following
, 
at the very least having
regard to the DHSS position
, 
following it closely.
I'm going to go to a document which shows how
officials put this issue to ministers in early 1987.
It's SCGV0000229_232.
Sorry, sir, if I could just have one moment to get
 
124
the document in my notes.
  
(Pause)
Sir, we can see the document is date
d
9 February 1987.  It is addressed from Mr Lugton to the
Minister of State.  At this time that Minister was
Lord Glenarthur.  The minute describes correspondence
which had been received as part of a campaign to obtain
compensation for haemophiliacs infected with the AIDS
virus 
via
 contaminate
d
 Factor VIII.
I
n
 paragraph 2 I pick up the way in which that
infection is described
: 
from supplies which were
unwittingly provided 
be
for
e
 treatment was introduced to
minimise the risk of Factor VIII containing the AIDS
virus.
Mr Lugton goes on to explain the reasons behind
the
 
Government position at the time
, 
which was not to
accept calls for such compensation.  We can see that at
the end of paragraph 3 where he says:
"Before compensation to haemophiliacs could be
seriously considered
, 
therefore, it would have to be
clearly established that they were a unique group who
could be clearly distinguished from any other 
victims of
drug mishaps or 
other medical accidents."
It made some reference to 
a 
Pearson 
report
 
of 
1978
on no-fault compensation
, 
and at paragraph 6 it says:
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  125
"Against this background
, 
we consider that the
Minister's replies should not hold out any hope of
a change of the Government's policy on this matter
 ...
"
It also makes reference to responses which had
been 
sent
 by Lady Trumpington in the Department of
Health.
Now
, 
the written note describe
s
 Lord Glenarthur's
response to this minute in which he asks for some
changes to be made to the draft replies which had been
prepared to these letters while
,
 it seems
,
 not
challenging the substantive policy decision which was to
refuse calls for 
compensation
.
I'm going to move forward to autumn 1987
, 
by which
time Lord Forsyth had 
re
place
d 
Lord Glenarthur as the
Minister in the Department with responsibility for
Health.
What we see in the documents is the SHHD position
being maintained, refusing calls for compensation with
officials in the Department monitoring developments at
the DHSS
.  
As will be familiar to the Inquiry, the position
changed, at least to some extent, in November 198
7
, when
there was 
no
 acceptance that compensation was
appropriate, but a UK Government decision was taken to
make an ex gratia payment to haemophilia patients and
 
126
their families who had been infected with HIV.
Now, that decision was considered at a meeting of
the Subcommittee on AIDS of the Home and Social Affairs
Committee, H(A) Committee
, 
on 
10
 November 1987, worth
noting that that was a meeting and a committee attended
by Malcolm Rifkind
, 
who was at that time Secretary of
State for Scotland.  So Mr Rifkind
, 
as Secretary of
State for Scotland, was involved in the discussions and
the decision-making process that led to the announcement
of the ex gratia payment in November 1987.
The documents suggest that in 
early 1988, 
the
course of 1988, after this announcement was made,
officials in the Department had relatively little
involvement in the setting up of the Macfarlane Trust
which was to administer this ex gratia payment.  That's
1988.
We're going to jump forward again to
November 1989, the reasons I'm jumping forward will
I hope 
become
 apparent.  In November 1989,
Kenneth Clarke, the Minister in England and Wales,
announced that an additional ex gratia payment to the
Macfarlane Trust would be made.  Part of the reason for
jumping forward in the way that I did is that decision
seems to have been taken without any consultation or
discussions with officials in the Scottish Office
 
so
,
 
127
effectively, November 1989, Scottish Office officials
and ministers learn that this decision had been taken.
There then followed discussion within the HHD and
with the Department of Health about whether the
Scottish Office should be required to contribute to the
funding of this additional payment, particularly given
that the Department 
hadn't
 been consulted at all
, 
before
the decision was taken and announced
, 
if it should be
asked to contribute, how much of the funding should it
be asked to provide
.
It was eventually agreed that the Scottish Office
should contribute
, 
and that it should do so on the basis
of the proportion of haemophilia patients infected with
HIV from blood products who lived in Scotland.
Now
, 
that agreement to contribute to this funding
was obtained by officials in the Department from
Lord
 
Forsyth in early February 1990, following
a submission which was put to the minister setting out
the background to the announcement, setting out the
discussions which had followed it about the Scottish
Office's contribution or potential contribution to the
funding, and we can see that Lord Forsyth accepted that
the Department should contribute to this additional
payment.
I'm moving 
o
n now, sir, to the HIV Litigation.
 
128
Moving back slightly in time from November 1989
,
when the additional ex gratia payment was announced
, 
to
1988, and the documents show that claims in the
HIV Litigation began to be lodged in the Scottish courts
against Scottish health boards, the SNBTS, and the
Secretary of State for Scotland.
Now
, 
those three individuals and bodies referred
to in the Scottish litigation generally as defenders.
What we can see in the document summarised in the notes,
during the course of 1988, representatives from those
different defenders, so the Secretary of State, the
Health Boards, the SNBTS, met to discuss their responses
to the claims.  The documents suggest that at this time
they
 shared the view that the actions should be
defended.
In early 1989 the Health Minister in the
Department, Lord Forsyth, asked for an update on the
litigation in light of 
a
 
newspaper
 report.  And I'll go
to that document
 
in which he was provided the update
now.  It's SCGV0000229_052.
Sir, this is advice provided by Mr MacNiven to
Mr Forsyth.  We can see that the article was prompted
by -- sorry
, 
the advice was prompted by an article in
the Daily Record
, 
January of that year, that said, "You
gave us AIDS".  In response
 to it
, 
the Minister made
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  129
a request for advice.
Mr MacNiven begins by summarising the background
and the nature of the claims.  If we go down, we can see
that in paragraph 5
.  
Paragraph 6
, 
the number of claims
to date is outlined
.  
Then in paragraph 7
, 
at the
bottom, Mr MacNiven noted that the Department was
working with the Solicitor's Office to prepare defences
on behalf of the Secretary of State for keeping in touch
with the other defenders in the action.  Then over the
page:
"Should the Minister be asked to comment on any of
these cases I would advise him to point to the 
£10m
ex gratia payment
 (
which was evidence
 
of the
Government's concern and sympathy for the plight of the
haemophiliacs infect
ed
 with HIV
) 
and to say that the
cases alleging negligence are a matter for the courts to
decide
.
"
In other words
, 
reflecting the UK Government
position that compensation was not to be paid in
response to these claims.
 
Now
, 
as we've seen 
in 
late 1989, the additional
payment to the Macfarlane Trust was announced without
any consultation with the Scottish Office
, 
and then
during the course of 1990
, 
the following year, officials
continued to monitor the Department of Health's position
 
130
on the HIV Litigation, particularly in light of their
experience with the announcement of the additional
payment to the Macfarlane Trust, to try to understand
the position of the Department of Health and the
possibility that any further payment might be made.
Now
, 
there is some suggestion in the documents
that in early December 1990, the Scottish Office came to
believe that there was some possibility that a payment
might be made to settle the litigation.  That's a brief
handwritten reference in some of the Scottish Office
SHHD documents we have rather than anything formal from
the Department of Health to the Scottish Office.
Then on 11 December 1990, the Prime Minister
announced, in response to a Parliamentary question, that
the Government had agreed in principle to settle the
HIV Litigation
.
Now
, 
similarly 
with
 the announcement 
of
the additional payments to the Macfarlane Trust, 
the
Scottish Office does not 
seem
 to have had any
involvement in the negotiations leading to this
announcement.  The documents indicate that this resulted
in difficulties for the Department's attempts to settle
the Scottish claims.
As well as Scottish Office officials expressing
their concern to other UK Government officials, the
 
131
documents show solicitors acting for the litigants in
Scotland expressing their dismay at being excluded from
the negotiations leading to this announcement
.  
What
became clear was that negotiations had been taking place
in England and Wales between the lawyers, 
the
 litigants
there, and the Department's representatives.  The
parties of the lawyers in Scotland
, 
as well as the
officials
, 
had been excluded from those negotiations.
We can see that dismay being expressed in a letter
from Mr Tyler
, 
who worked at Balfour and Manson
solicitors
, 
and who was also chair of the Scottish
Haemophilia HIV Litigation Group.  That was an
association of Scottish firms representing individuals
in Scotland who were involved in the litigation.
One point to 
note, my 
understand
ing 
here is that
the procedural 
rules that applied in 
Scotland at th
is
time didn't allow for a group litigation claim
, 
as was
the case in England.  Instead, you had 
a 
number of
different claims but which were coordinated through this
association of which Mr Tyler was the chair.
Now
, 
from December 1990
, 
after this announcement,
officials in the Scottish Office, both in the Department
and in other department
s, 
like those in the Scottish
Legal Office, worked on preparing and negotiating
settlement terms for the Scottish claims.  That involved
 
132
a number of challenges, and this is a trite point for
which I apologise, but
 
Scotland having a separate legal
system, it was not simply the case that the terms could
be proposed, agreed in England and Wales
, 
and be
transposed to Scotland.  Work had to be undertaken in
Scotland to make any potential settlement work there.
One of the key issues that became apparent in the
months that followed, so from December 1990
, 
in the
first few months of 1991, was that additional time was
going to be necessary for this process to take place
and
, 
in particular, for the lawyers representing the
Scottish litigants to be able to investigate their
clients' claims.
Issues related to funding for lawyers, the
availab
ility 
of Legal Aid and other funding, meant the
re
had been relatively little investigation of the facts
underlying the claims.  This was a point considered
internally by Scottish Office officials, discussed with
lawyers representing Scottish litigants.  It became
apparent that it was going to be necessary for the
Scottish lawyers to have some additional time to those
in England and Wales to investigate and consider their
claims.
Now
, 
this issue was addressed in a minute from
Mr Tucker to Mr Forsyth and the Secretary of State who
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  133
at the time was Ian
 Lang
.  That minute came about
following a suggestion from Mr Forsyth that the
Department should try to move speedily towards
a settlement in Scotland.  Mr Tucker described some 
of
the factors I've just outlined, 
and 
suggested that
additional time be given for litigants in Scotland to
consider the possibility of settlement.
Now
, 
in order for that to be possible, it was
suggested that ministers and
, 
in fact
, 
the Secretary of
State for Scotland get in touch with his counterpart in
England and Wales in order to ask for additional time
for litigants in Scotland.
We can go just briefly to a couple of documents
before the break on this issue
.  
The first is DHSE0003660_009.
This is a letter dated 17 January 1991.  It's from
the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Lang, to
William
 
Waldegrave
, 
the Secretary of State for Health.
If we go down, we'll see in the first paragraph
the letter describes some of the 
back
ground
 to
the 
recent agreement in principle that had been reached
in England and Wales to settle the litigation
.  
Then
, 
on to the next paragraph, the letter sets
out that there are separate Scottish legal 
actions 
for
compensation that 
hadn't
 progressed as far as the
 
134
English 
claims
, that the Scottish lawyers concerned were
not represented on the Steering 
Committee 
and had not
been party to the preparation of the proposals nor
involved in the discussions which had taken place with
the Steering Committee
:  
"
This ha
s 
placed the Scottish Office in
a difficult position since all the discussions on the
details of the settlement 
have
 been in relation to the
English plaintiffs and 
there 
have already been
representations made to me by the Scottish lawyers that
they were not consult before the offer was made public.
They consider that they are not in a position to advise
their clients on acceptance or otherwise until they know
and can assess the contents of the offer and conditions
of acceptance
 
but also until they are fully investigated
their clients' claims."
That summarises some of the points I was just
trying to make.
If we move down to the bottom of this page, and on
to the next one, we see that the letter sets out 
that
the Scottish lawyers
 
estimate that they would need some
additional time
, 
over the page, to carry out the further
assessment of the acceptability of the proposals for the
settlement.  Mr Lang proposes that a reasonable further
period be allowed to the lawyers in order for them to
 
135
consider the settlement offer.
If we go just briefly to Mr Waldegrave's reply,
which is at DHS
C
0003660_010
, 
30 January 1991.
The letter records that a deadline of the
acceptance of the offer made in England and Wales 
had
not yet been set.  Down the page, the Secretary of
State
, 
Mr Waldegrave
, 
comments:
"... 
I quite understand the difficulties you would
face in trying to complete 
a
 settlement in Scotland in
the same timescale
 [
as has had been proposed in England
and Wales
]
.  I have 
no
 objection
,
 therefore
,
 to your
proposal to set a reasonable period for Scottish
litigants to be 
advised
 by their lawyers 
on
 a response
to the offer."
Then in the next paragraph:
"While differences over timing are manageable,
I think that the terms to of the settlement must be the
same for all to avoid reopening the whole issue."
Then the bottom of this paragraph
, 
the final
sentence:
"I hope, therefore, you will accept that the size
and categories of payment on offer must be com
m
on to all
litigants wherever they have pursued their action."
So an emphasis on the need for the nature of the
settlement
s
 in Scotland and England and Wales to match,
 
136
even if some additional time might be needed in Scotland
as a result of the way that the compromise announcement
was made.
Sir, I note the time.  I have a few -- a number of
further documents and 
issues
 to highlight in relation to
litigation, including one I prefaced right at the
beginning of 
today
, 
this morning, the question of the
waiver which applied in Scotland as against the waive
r
which applied in England and Wales.  I wonder if it
might be a convenient moment
.

--Result #781--

  
Sir, we'll seek to bottom out some of those
differences that I've described and that you've alighted
on.
For today's purposes, we can turn next to the
formal offer that was made by the Scottish Office to
solicitors representing litigants in Scotland to settle
the litigation, which took place nearly two months, six,
seven weeks after this document of 24 
June
 
1991.
Can we please go first to DHSC0003635_065.
So a document dated 24 June 1991, addressed to
Balfour and Manson.  It comes from Richard Henderson,
from the Scottish Solicitor's Office.
If we look at the second paragraph, Mr Henderson
wrote:
"I
 am 
authorised on behalf of the Secretary of
State to offer formally to you terms of settlement for
individual claims 
at 
the 
instance
 
of pursuers listed
 in
Annex A to this letter and for 
the settlement of 
claims
for
 damages against the Secretary of State on behalf of
those claimants listed in Annex B.  The terms of
settlement are set out in the document labelled Anne
x 
C
 
146
attached with this letter.
"I also attach a copy of the Macfarlane (Special
Payments)
(No
 2) Trust dated 
3
 May 1991 
[
the document we
just looked at] together with a copy of revised draft
Schedule 4 to the 
Deed
 of Trust.  Arrangements are being
made to vary the terms of the 
Deed
 of Trust to
facilitate payments in terms 
[
I think that should say
'
in terms
'] ... 
of settlement
.  
This will entail
substitution 
of
 Schedule 4 and also Schedule 3 
(
Form 
of
Undertaking
)
.  The appropriate Form of Undertaking is
set out in Schedule 1 to the terms of settlement.
I
 
understand that you will arrange for the offers to be
communicated to the individual pursuers and claimants
through their appropriate legal advisers."
Just over the page, the first paragraph there,
Mr Henderson writes:
"Upon receipt of that pro forma letter and
schedule, we will issue the appropriate certificate to
the Macfarlane Trust
.
"
So outlining the procedure for claims to be
settled.
"We understand that thereafter the Trust should be
in a position to release payments to individual
claimants."
Now, the detailed terms of settlement with the
 
147
proposed substituted undertakings 
which 
accompanied this
letter, we understand to be the document at BNOR0000329.
Now
, 
we can see in the top right-hand corner
,
annex C, which was the same annex letter referred to in
that cover letter we just looked at, the title of this
document
:
"Detailed Terms of Settlement of HIV
/
Haemophilia
Claims in Scotland"
Now
, 
we don't need to go through all of the terms
that are offered in this document.  If we could please
go through to page 11, we have an undertaking which
, 
as
we'll see
, 
is different to the undertaking contained in
the 3 May 1991 declaration of trust.  The title
:
"Undertaking to be given by a qualifying 
person 
to
receive payment from the Macfarlane Trust"
If we go down to the bottom half of the page:
"I hereby discharge 
the 
said Secretary of State
[
Secretary of State for Scotland
] 
and all other
Ministers of the Crown, Government departments 
and
 other
bodies 
from
 any 
liability
 that they may have in
respect of 
the 
infection of X person with
immunodeficiency virus
 ...
"
No
 reference to hepatitis viruses
:
"... 
alleg
edly 
arising out of treatment with
Factor VIII or Factor IX
, 
whether cryoprecipitate or
 
148
concentrate."
The remainder of the undertaking sets out other
forms of wording, discharging parties from agreeing to
give up the right to bring future claims.  Again, it
seems relating 
only 
to HIV and not hepatitis viruses.
S
ir, 
we seem to see, in this document, a different
undertaking and a waive
r
 that's different in its scope
addressing only HIV and not also hepatitis
.
I can then move on, please, to the variation to
the 
deed
 of trust which took place in September 
1991
.
A
 
minute ago
, 
when we looked at the cover letter that
was sent to Scottish litigants' representatives, it
pointed to the fact that
 -- 
or suggested that it was
going to be necessary to vary the 
deed
 of the
Macfarlane Trust
.
And we can see that document at MACF0000083_003.
So
, 
19 September 1991, 
deed
 of variation relating
to the Macfarlane (Special Payments) (No 2) Trust
.  
And
over the page, following an introductory wording, at the
bottom of this page, now this 
deed
 witnesses as follows:
"
Substitution of schedule 3
.
  
For
 schedule 3 to
the Trust 
Deed
 there 
shall
 
be 
substituted the
following
 ...
"
And if we go over the page, a different schedule 3
is proposed.  For current purposes, going to focus on
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  149
page 7, where there is substitution for schedule
 
4
, 
and
this schedule 4 appears to be in the same terms as that
which 
we just considered, in other words only containing
a waive
r
 for HIV
, 
also containing a waiver for
hepatitis.
What that suggests is that waiver 
which 
applied in
Scotland rather than England and Wales, applied only to
future 
payments 
relating to HIV and not also to
hepatitis.  We are going to come back in the note that
we're going to disclose to 
try and 
trace in a bit more
detail how it was that came about, if indeed that's
right
, 
as well as addressing, sir, the points that you
raised in our discussion earlier.
Now
, 
one of the issues that arose following the
settlement of the main HIV Litigation claims in Scotland
related to a category of claims which was termed
"Category G".  The written note sets out some detail 
o
n
this issue.  It arose around September 1991, concerns
Category G claims.  Broadly put, these were claims for
compensation by spouses, 
parents 
and children of
HIV
-
infected haemophiliacs
, 
who 
had
 not themselves been
infected with HIV, but were at risk of doing so because
of their close and regular contact with an infected
haemophiliac.
Now
, 
those claims were restricted by certain
 
150
criteria because of differences in the way the
litigation in England and Wales proceed
ed
 and that in
Scotland
.  
Because of
 
ways related to
 
the settlement was
being reached
 
the restriction on eligibility for
Category G claimants 
had 
the effect of 
ex
cluding more
claims in Scotland than England and Wales.  This issue
arose
.  
It was considered by officials in the
Scottish Office.  There were discussions between those
officials and representatives of the Department of
Health.
What appears to have happen
ed
 is that the
eligibility criteria in Scotland 
were
 changed.  As
a
 
result, more claims became eligible, and this was at
least an attempt to mitigate or reduce the disparity
that seemed to have arisen for this category of claims
between Scotland and England and Wales.  There's some
detail contained in the written note and I'm not going
to address it any further today
, 
sir.
Now that concludes what I intended to cover 
today
about the HIV Litigation.  I'm going to finally address
quite briefly compensation claims and decisions related
to HIV infection through blood transfusion.
Now
, 
if
 
we go back in time, we can see in the
documents that around the time of the additional payment
to the Macfarlane Trust in November 1989, consideration
 
151
was given within the HHD to the question of compensation
or other payments for patients who ha
d
 been infected
with HIV through blood transfusions rather than
treatment with factor concentrates.
In early 1990 Lord Forsyth, who was the relevant
minister at the time, was advised that the UK Government
position was that compensation would not be paid to such
individuals.  So 
no
 doubt you'll recall Lord Forsyth
gave oral evidence on this issue.  He described, if
I can paraphrase it, being unconvinced by some of the
reasons that were put to him by officials for this
position.  Nonetheless, the overall policy position of
the Home and Health Department remained in line with
that of the wider UK Government
, 
and the position was
that 
no
 money would be paid to such patients.
This issue arose again a little while later in
early 1991 in the context of the HIV Litigation.  The
document suggested that around this time when the issue
came up again, Lord Forsyth effectively reaffirmed the
view that he'd expressed previously that the
distinctions that were being sought to be made between
haemophilia patients and transfusion patients didn't
stack 
up.
We can see a number of documents that are
summarised in the written notes in which this particular
 
152
issue was discussed by departmental officials, discussed
with lawyers in the Scottish Office, and that some of
those discussions were prompted by correspondence which
had been 
sent
 by campaigning groups 
to 
the Department of
Health and responded to by Department of Health
Ministers.  The HHD became involved.  There was some
criticism we can see in the documents summarised in the
notes of the distinction which was being maintained
between haemophilia patients and transfusion patients.
Nonetheless, the position continued to be that of
the wider Government, which was 
no
 payments would be
made.  We can get an insight into Lord Forsyth's views
from a contemporaneous document at SCGV0000234_198.
Now
, 
it's dated 2 May 1991.  I haven't gone to the
minute which preceded this document, but it was one
which reaffirmed the Government position that 
no
 money
was to be paid to individuals 
who'd
 been infected with
HIV through blood transfusion
, 
and it records this.
It's from Mr Forsyth's private secretary:
"Mr Forsyth has seen Mr Tucker's minute of
2
9 April 1991 and your minute of 1 May 1991 about whole
blood transfusions.  Mr Forsyth considers that this is
an extremely serious matter and that the Government's
position is indefensible.  He has commented that we are
in danger of losing a lot of goodwill carping over
 

21 September 2022
          
          

  153
a small financial obligation.  Our refusal to release
information on records leaves us particularly
vulnerable.  Mr Forsyth hopes we might try to change the
Government's line on this matter."
Now
, 
despite the view that was expressed there on
behalf of Lord Forsyth, the Government position adopted
by the Scottish Office was maintained for most of the
rest of 1991.
The position changed in December 1991 when the
Secretary of State for Health in England and Wales
recommended a change of policy to the Treasury that was
accepted.
Now
, 
similarly to other examples we've considered
today
, that change of policy appears to have happen
ed
with little or 
no
 consultation between the
UK Government's Secretary of State for Health and
ministers and officials in Scotland.  Despite that lack
of consultation there was again a request for Scotland
and the other departments in the UK to contribute some
of the funding that would be required for this change of
policy, and there are a number of documents in which
officials and subsequently ministers address this
question of how much
 -- 
whether and how much they should
be expected to contribute to the payments to these
individuals, despite the lack of consultation from
 
154
Central Government.
These issues were set out in a minute,
a submission from Mr Tucker to ministers in
December 1991, which proposed that the Scottish Office
should accept the change of policy and also 
that
a financial contribution should come from the
Scottish Office to these payments.  That was accepted by
ministers.
Now, there was then over the next few months work
to 
finalise 
and set up the scheme through which payments
would 
be made to individuals who had been infected with
HIV by blood transfusion or tissue transfer.
In the last document I'm going to bring up 
today
,
I'm going to highlight how the document describes the
scheme, which was agreed and set up, but also link back
to the waiver issue we were discussing earlier.
It's dated April 1992 and it's at SCGV0000239_024.
Now
, 
this is a minute dated 9 April 1992 from
Mr Tucker to the chief executive of the NHS in Scotland,
I believe it was Mr Cruickshank at the time, seeking his
approval for the Scottish scheme for payments to HIV
infected recipients of blood and tissue and we can see
that
 from the first paragraph.
The remainder of this document sets out the detail
of the scheme, the background 
to
 
it
 and I'm not going to
 
155
go into that detail now.  I'm just going to pick up on
page 2
, 
the section headed
 
"Differences with English
Scheme"
,
 and then paragraph 9.
"I should also draw to your attention the terms of
Annex 1 to the Scheme which sets out the form of
undertaking to be given by the applicant.  Our form does
not require an undertaking discharging the Secretary of
State in respect of liability for infection of the
applicant with hepatitis virus.  In that respect it
differs from the English form of undertaking.  However
again we consider ourselves to be bound by the terms of
the haemophilia settlement which did not limit
an applicant's rights in connection with hepatitis
infection.  We have had strong representation against
extending the undertaking into this area.  Our medical
and legal advisers specifically support the exclusion of
reference to hepatitis from the undertaking
.
"
So again, difference in the nature of the waiver
undertaking applicable in Scotland as with England and
Wales, to be explored further in the note which will be
prepared by the Inquiry team and disclosed as soon as we
can.
So that completes the material I intended to cover
today.  We've covered a large number of documents
,
a
 
large number of documents.  
I 
hope it's been of
 
156
assistance in setting the framework and the structure of
the detail which is contained in the written note, which
has already been disclosed.

--Result #782--

  
In terms of the letter from your
haematologist, I think it would be helpful to put that
up so 
that 
we can look at it
.  
The reference is
COLL0000010
, 
and I think it is page 45 that we want
please.
Just picking up from the third paragraph and I'm
going to read quite 
a
 chunk of it out
, 
Steven.
"
Mr Towsey first 
received
 Factor VIII in 1979 for
seven days.  This was in the context of 
a
 bleed in one
of his hips.
"His notes are unfortunately incomplete in that
they no longer contain records of his early review
visits, and that none of the biochemical screenings he
 
31
would have undergone in the early 1980s are in his
notes.
"There is 
a
 period
,
 therefore
,
 between 1979 and
1985 when it is likely that Mr Towsey had
a
 transaminitis, but we are not in 
a
 position to prove
this or 
indeed
 disprove that he had 
an
 active
hepatitis C infection at the time.
"Regular records of biochemical screening, in the
form of 
a
 summary sheet, are not available until 1985,
and have been normal since, noting that our results in
Lewisham stop in 2000
, 
when his care was transferred to
Addenbrooke's.  Mr Towsey was first noted to be
hepatitis C
 
antibody positive in 1992 and his first PCR
result was in 1995 and negative.
"In addition, and even though his hepatitis C PCR
has been undetectable on the four occasions when it was
tested, most recently in 1999, there is no guarantee
that the 15% or so 
of 
hepatitis C patients who become
PCR undetectable without undergoing any treatment will
never reactivate.  There is certainly evidence
,
 however
,
that some 5% or so of hepatitis C positive patients who
become PCR undetectable after treatment, will
reactivate.
"Given that Mr Towsey first became aware of his
hepatitis C status in 1992, there were at least
 
32
three
 
years during which he had no reassuring
information in the form of negative PCR as the
technology was not available.  
[... redacted ...]
.
"The psychological distress caused to Mr Towsey
under the circumstances has been considerable, given his
knowledge of his own infection by the same or similar
agent.  I would therefore recommend Mr Towsey very
strongly for compensation under the Skipton Fund
scheme."
That was the letter that was provided by the
Lewisham consultant?

--Result #783--
1989 to 1991, it was established in '89.  We made
regular payments to some individuals, not to all
individuals.  It was very much based on an assessment
of individual need and people's individual
circumstances, and people really were struggling, some 
    14people were really struggling.  So regular payments
were made to those who needed them until 1991 when, in
fact, a further tranche of compensation was paid.

--Result #784--
 Now, the second main plank of financial support for
those who were infected is the compensation tribunal,
and so I just wanted to ask you a little about how
that --

--Result #785--
That's correct.  We employed a legal team from 1989
and worked with them and we were looking at
the Society actually funding a test case.  But as this
was going on and on through the course of 1990, it
became apparent this was not going to see a courtroom
at any time in the immediate future and in the
meantime the number of people dying of AIDS and
getting AIDS was increasing rapidly.  We then saw that
the -- the compensation paid by the John Major-led
Government in the UK, and we decided the time was
right to try and settle this politically.  So at
the time the minister asked the Society for
a submission to settle these legal cases and we
entered, again, into a four or five-month political
and media campaign, culminating in an offer of
compensation in 1991.

--Result #786--
That's correct.  Obviously, when the hepatitis C virus
was identified in 1989, it became a topic where --
which we discussed out our conferences in '89, '90,
'91, '92, we were doing quite a bit of work on this,
and the first treatment for hepatitis C, Interferon,
there was actually a monthly charge for this, which we
felt they should certainly not be charging to people
who had been infected through blood products supplied
by the state.  So we had a series of meetings with
the Health Ministry to discuss removing that charge
for people with haemophilia, and we also initiated
discussions on compensation at that point.

--Result #787--
 So the Department agreed to set up a hepatitis C
compensation tribunal, and that became a statutory
tribunal under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal
Act of 1997.  If we just look briefly at that.
WITN7418010.
So we've got the arrangement of the Act there.  If
we go, please, to page 4, we can see, bottom of the
page, section 3 establishes the Tribunal: 
"... a Tribunal to be known as the Hepatitis C
Compensation Tribunal to award compensation ..."                
     25And to a class of claimants.
Now, just before we look at who could claim from
this Tribunal, this uses the term "compensation"
rather than  "ex gratia  payments", so was that
significant to your mind, that this was an acceptance
of compensation, rather than the making of a payment
to dispose of litigation?

--Result #788--
Yes, because there was no litigation ongoing at
the time in relation to hepatitis C infection, and
the word "compensation" was used very clearly by
Government and, in fact, they're not going to put
the word in an Act without thinking it through,
whereas in 1989 the word was banned, they talked about
"recompense" or  "ex gratia  payments" without admission
of liability.  "Compensation" was clearly understood
to be compensation in --

--Result #789--
That's correct.  And in fact it's worth, I think,
reiterating that the compensation tribunal -- that
the first payments under the compensation tribunal
were made a year before the Lindsay Tribunal terms of
reference were even -- the discussions started
four years before the tribunal started hearings and
six years before the report.  So I think they had 
    26clearly -- I think the Government put their hand up
and accepted responsibility at that point.  Yeah,
there was no legal admission of responsibility but,
clearly, they were paying compensation.

--Result #790--
 Then is it right to understand that the claimant
making the claim to the compensation tribunal could
elect for a lump sum, so an assessment of their
compensation once and for all, or for provisional
damages?

--Result #791--
Yes, the majority elected for a one-off lump sum
award, but there was also the option to take an
initial award, especially if the individual was
concerned about progression of liver disease or what
they were facing in the future.  And then there would
be specific wording in their tribunal award which
would allow them to go back for further compensation
in specified circumstances.  For example, an
individual who had cirrhosis might have wording in his
award saying that if he or she required a liver
transplant and there were costs associated with that, 
    31they could then go back to the tribunal for a further
award.  So I think a number of people -- also some of
the younger claimants whose career path had not been
set, where the impact of the hepatitis C on their
medium to long-term future could not be wholly
ascertained, would often have a provisional award and
then go back later on for a full award.

--Result #792--
 Is it right to understand that the approach that
the tribunal was required to take to the assessment of
compensation was to apply the same approach that
the courts would apply in a claim, a tortious claim,
for damages for personal injuries?

--Result #793--
In 2002 we had an election coming up, again, and we'd
had the hearings of the Lindsay Tribunal, including
the very powerful public testimony of members, during
the course of the tribunal, and in the two years
leading up to the tribunal and during the course of
the tribunal we had constant meetings with Government
on various issues.  But one of the things was pressing
for was that we felt that the 1991 awards, while very,
very welcome at the time, were -- were -- they were
not fair and equitable compensation for people who
got HIV.  We felt, really, that those individuals had
been shortchanged, and in particular -- in
particular -- the families of those who had passed 
    34away prior to 1991.
So it basically came about, I think, as a result
of our discussions with Government and, frankly, the
public impact of the very powerful public testimony at
Lindsay.

--Result #794--
 So if we go back to your statement, so WITN7418001,
pages 28 to 29.  If we start at the bottom of page 28,
we can see there was an amendment to the 1997 Act
through the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal
(Amendment) Bill, 2002.  
Then if we go to the next page, you've listed in
paragraph 59 those who could apply for compensation
following the amendment.  So, similar to what we've
seen previously, but now encompassing HIV and the
children or spouses of those infected with HIV,
dependants and carers, HIV as well as hepatitis C?

--Result #795--
Yes.  And I think the significant part of that for us,
really, was if you look at the section e, that the:
"Widows or Dependants of those who had died."
So the individual was no longer disadvantaged by
the fact that they'd passed away prior to the 1991
Act, their families were getting the full compensation
that they would have been entitled to had they
survived to that point.

--Result #796--
That's correct, and bear in mind, however, that all of
those were infected with HIV were also co-infected
with hepatitis C, so they had been compensated
previously through the '91 settlement, but also
through the 1997 Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal
Act.  But this broadened it, really, to give more
compensation to people with HIV and, particularly, to
the families of those who had passed away.

--Result #797--
 In terms of who sits on the tribunal, I don't mean by
name, but what are the kind of -- what kind of
individuals are appointed to the compensation
tribunal?

--Result #798--
   In terms of the success of the scheme, as
well as the features you've identified, would it be
right to understand that perhaps the major hallmark of
success has been that it's resulted in the payment of
substantial amounts of compensation to those who were
infected and whose lives were devastated as a result?
So they have received an award which is deliberately
designed to compensate them for their losses?

--Result #799--
Yes, I mean, I think the process has been very good
for the vast majority of people but some cases have
taken several years to get to a hearing.  If
the individual who was infected was a child, then you
can't really ascertain their loss of earnings or their
future potential career possibilities for many, many
years, so there may be a provisional award, an award
later, and that has meant that the process has taken
quite a long time for some people.  And, you know,
even though it's a very good process, it does delay
closure.  So until an individual has finished entirely
with the compensation tribunal, it's kind of hard to
bring some closure to the issue.  So I think that's
the -- the big disadvantage is the time required.

--Result #800--
I'm aware of the interim payments made here,
Sir Brian, and I think that was greatly to be
welcomed, and I think if we were starting off again at
this point -- it's 20 years later, and our population
is 20 years older than they were when compensation was
awarded in 2002 -- I'm sure we'd have gone for interim
payments initially as well, because there can be
a long prime before the final case is heard.
So I think our system has worked very well for our
members, but I think -- in looking at this, I think it
is wise to reflect on the potential for delay in
hearing individual cases.

--Result #801--
It was not a hard battle.  Unlike the compensation
battles, that was not a hard battle.  I think the fact
that you had a couple of hundred people with
haemophilia; you had several hundred people who had
been infected through blood transfusion; you had in
excess of 1,000 women who had been infected through
anti-D; all of these groups collectively wanted access
to better healthcare.  
So I think it was, very much, a case of coming up
with a solution for, in a sense, in relation to
the total population, a relatively small group of
people, 3,000 or 4,000 people in total.  So I think
that's -- one of the reasons the card was put in place
was because the number of people who would benefit
would be finite and wouldn't be increasing.  So it
wasn't a hard battle to have it put in place.

--Result #802--
I would have said if we were speaking back in '95,
'96, '97, our members were much more concerned about
compensation on these issues and the forthcoming
inquiry than they were about the HAA card.  But when
I look back on it now with the benefit of hindsight,
the HAA card has been absolutely crucial because it
gives people prioritised access to a lot of
the healthcare and services and support they need on
an ongoing basis.  It has been invaluable for people
when they run into trouble health-wise.  And when
people are at the point where -- if they are getting
near to the end of their life, it has been absolutely
amazing in terms of the help and support we can put in
place very quickly.

--Result #803--
 And same question as with the compensation tribunal. 
    63If you were setting up the scheme again from scratch,
would you make any changes to it or has it worked in
the way you would have wished it to?

--Result #804--
 But I don't think we need to look at those. 
    68If we go back to that guide that we were looking
at earlier, because it's got a section on insurance,
and think it might be a convenient way of picking it
up.  
WITN7418011, please, page 23.
So we've got the heading "Insurance Scheme",
travel insurance, mortgage protection insurance, life
insurance for persons who were infected through blood
or blood products within the state.
Then we've got the general rules for the insurance
scheme, and if we just look at the whole page for
a moment, we can see there is a heading at the bottom
half of the page:
"Eligibility.
"To avail of the insurance scheme you must have an
eligibility certificate."
Then there is a description of how you get that.
Then, in terms of getting an eligibility
certificate, if you've got an HAA card or you've been
awarded compensation by the tribunal, you get
the eligibility certificate automatically?

--Result #805--
I think it's been very important because it means that
individuals can take out life insurance at
a reasonable cost; they can provide for their family,
their dependants, in the event of their death up to
the age of 65 or 75, depending on when they took it
out; and it also means that if they do get
compensation they can actually use that compensation
to live their life and not necessarily have to salt it
to away to provide for their family in the event of
their death.

--Result #806--
 Then just a final question from me for now, Brian.
Those three types of scheme that we've been looking
at, so the provision for compensation through
the tribunal, the HAA card and then the insurance
scheme, these are all measures that have been taken by
the state --

--Result #807--
I think hugely important.  When I look at the Lindsay
Inquiry and I think a couple of things come to mind.
The personal testimony was hugely important.
The public understanding of what had happened to
the community was very, very important, and the public
understanding was, frankly, helped by very responsible
media coverage in the Irish media.  All of the main
daily newspapers covered it, you know, in great
detail.
I think the apology from the Government after the
report came out, the compensation which was put in
place without having to wait for the Inquiry report,
the HAA card, the insurance, the tax concessions,
these were all really important in an overall view
that: look, this happened, this was an awful thing
that happened to you, we're really sorry and we're
going to make it up to you in any way that we can.

--Result #808--
No.  Not at all.  And, in fact, quite sadly, I think
the organisation which represented the women infected
through anti-D imploded.  The transfusion group have
just -- they really have just concentrated on
the issues around the card and on compensation but
they haven't got involved in any sense in terms of
policy.
But, of course, haemophilia is different.  If you
had a blood transfusion, you had an underlying                
     85condition which could be anything.  With haemophilia
and bleeding disorders there was a core set of the
same treatments, the same ideals, that go right
through that.  So -- but I think none of the other
organisations have been involved in policy in that
sense, although we do have a statutory hepatitis C
consultative council which does include
the organisations whose members were affected, and we
sit with the Department of Health and we monitor the
implementation of the HAA card and also the council
would organise information days every couple of years.

--Result #809--
 Then just going back to the work of the Compensation
Tribunal.  Do you know what approach is taken to
the assessment of compensation if there is a dispute
between family members?  So there may have been --
there may be competing claims in terms of care or
dependency.  Do you know whether that's arisen at all
in the Tribunal?

--Result #810--
 And in relation to taxation, you've explained
the position in your statement, but for the benefit of
those who may not have been able to read through your
statement, what in short is the position in terms of
taxation and the compensation awards?

--Result #811--
The compensation awards are tax-free.  That's clear.
But we also made submissions to the Revenue that there
is a section 189 in the Taxes Consolidation Act which
states that if an individual is permanently and
totally incapacitated then the income arising from
the award can also be tax exempt or exempt from
capital gains tax.  And we made a submission which was
accepted that, in fact, every person with haemophilia
who got hepatitis C or HIV would fall under
section 189, so their awards are tax-free but also any
income or capital gains earned from the awards, income
from the awards, is also tax-free.

--Result #812--
   When they do go to the PIAB, to what 
    88extent does the process there differ, if at all, from
the process that you're describing in the compensation
tribunal specifically for HCV and HIV?

--Result #813--
   -- in respect of their haemophilia
treatment or their transfusions, with the process that
would be applied in the courts.
The next question you may not be able to answer,
but I'm given to understand that there may be moves in
Ireland, in the Dáil, to introduce legislation which
will effectively reduce the amount of money which is
paid out in terms of compensation payments for those
who succeed in claims.  Do you have any awareness of
that or can you enlighten me on that?

--Result #814--
   There are not, but I have one further issue
I've been asked to raise with you, Brian.
Do you know whether the Irish Government had any
discussions with the pharmaceutical industry -- pharma
companies who had supplied concentrates that had
caused infection -- at any time, in terms of trying to
secure a contribution by pharma to the funding of
the compensation schemes?

--Result #815--
When we started our legal cases back in 1989, 1990 --
and these were proceeding very, very slowly -- then,
I mentioned earlier that at the end of 1990 we started
a political and media campaign to get the Ministry of
Health to agree compensation, and, you know, again,
there was a total lack of response from the Government
for several months, culminating at a point when,
actually, an offer was made on the same evening that
I was due to appear on a live TV debate with
the Minister.
But one of his rationales for the delay was that
they were engaged in negotiations with the 
    94US companies to see if they would give a contribution
to any eventual Irish compensation scheme.  My
understanding is that they were unsuccessful in that
attempt.
Now, we did assist our members -- a number of our
members in taking legal against some of the US pharma
companies and some of them did receive an award
separately.

--Result #816--

  
I 
just want to thank the Inquiry for the amazing
work 
that 
it's done and how 
it
 has raised the profile
,
and how it's actually managing to get us all
compensation and make things
,
 you know
,
 as well as
they can be.

--Result #817--
   Can I just add one aspect, as well as just
prompted by what Jayne has said, that as well as an
apology, where appropriate, and also incorporating the
lessons learned, obviously in some cases steps need to
be taken quickly to try to right the wrong and provide
what compensation is appropriate, and obviously that's
been a particular aspect of this Inquiry that I wanted
to comment on as well.

--Result #818--
   Sir, good morning.
By way of introduction, Lord Robert Winston,
professor, doctor, scientist, was entirely right to
describe the contaminated blood scandal as the worst
treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.
Disaster is a good word to connote the severity of
what happened but in certain usage it can connotesomething terrible but unavoidable, a natural disaster;
that is not what this was, we invite you to find.
This was a scandal, as we and others have long
described it, precisely because it was avoidable, it
need not have happened, and we will invite you to
conclude in your report that it should not have
happened.
Language is important and we expect a Prime Minister
to be careful with their words, and when she granted
this Inquiry in 2017 Theresa May described it as
an appalling tragedy which should simply never have
happened.  Jeremy Hunt, now Chancellor of the Exchequer,
agreed when he gave evidence to you on 27 July 2022.
Thousands of men, women and children have died or
have had the trajectory of their lives unavoidably
altered for the worse.  Families have been shattered.
This was a brutal, unacceptable, unforgivable and
unnecessary travesty visited upon patients in the
grossest breach of medical trust imaginable, with truly
devastating consequences.
A theme running through our submissions and those of
all the other Core Participants who have given you
written submissions for the infected and the affected is
individuals have been stripped of their dignity.  They
have been forced to lead lives they did not choose.  Ourtheme is that governments have, over the years, delayed,
denied and have degraded those who are infected and
affected by how they have subsequently been treated.
We will invite you to find in your report, as we
have done in writing, that all the concerns expressed by
our Core Participants and others, over decades, about
the blood products and the transfusions they were given
and the treatment they received and how they have
subsequently been dealt with will be fully borne out.
We analyse the totality of our submissions, we
reduce to one paragraph if we may in this way, we say
this preventible catastrophe arose from the combination
of pharmaceutical companies' greed and unsafe practices;
the skipping of known safety steps for blood products;
insufficient regulation, foresight and planning by
government; overenthusiasm on the part of clinicians
blinding them to the obvious risks and dangers of large
pool blood products; failure on the part of the
government and clinicians to recognise the long-standing
danger of non-A, non-B hepatitis, hepatitis C as it
became to be known, and their failure to respond
appropriately and quickly to HIV, HTLV-III as it was
initially called; and most significantly, failure to
apprise the patients, or, when they were children, their
parents, of the true state of affairs at the time or ownup quickly afterwards.
That, in a nutshell, is our summary.  Failing to
apprise the patients or their parents of the risks and
the options denied them the power to exercise their own
informed choice over treatment.  It turned them into
mere passive recipients of what others wrongly decided
was best for them.
Those affected and infected have battled for decades
to lay bare what we have now heard in the last
four years of evidence.  But we pause at the end of the
introduction to ask this: why, in the United Kingdom, in
the 21st century, did it have to come to this?  Why has
the truth had to be squeezed out of government by
campaigners through litigation and through public
Inquiry?
Here's an answer.  Jeremy Hunt, formerly Secretary
of State, now Chancellor of the Exchequer and, we
presume therefore, partly involved in decision-making
when you report, sir, had reflected on this before he
gave his evidence to you, and he said honestly in his
oral evidence to you, sir, "I am afraid that
institutions and the state close ranks around a lie
sometimes and I think that's what happened in this
case".
For those who weren't here to hear him, we should                
      5pause and let that sink in.  He thinks the institutions
of the state closed ranks around a lie.  And that is
a conclusion we invite you to draw in your final report.
Also at the outset, sir, if I may, a few words about
the word "liability".  I said a moment ago that language
matters, and indeed it does.  We recognise that in your
report you cannot determine civil or criminal liability
but we invite you in careful language to appropriately
emphasise what we describe as catastrophic failings,
woefully inadequate decision-making by government and,
in many cases, utterly unacceptable treatment of
patients.
We say there have been egregious failings of the
grossest kind on the part of pharmaceutical companies,
civil servants, ministers and clinicians.
You will recall and we note in passing here, we will
come back to it later if we have time, the unequivocal
view of Professor Savidge in his contemporaneous expert
report that the treatment of at least one of the boys,
of one of the witnesses who gave evidence to you,
Susan Hallwood at Alder Hey Hospital was, in his words,
negligent, negligent, negligent.
Without yourself determining negligence, you, sir,
have seen and can record in your report how others such
as Professor Savidge described it at the time.  Whileyou may be restricted by the Inquiries Act from yourself
reaching a conclusion of negligent, that is how we
describe it.
The Inquiry has heard the line peddled by
governments for decades that this was all done in
accordance with the standards of the time and that
patients got the best possible treatment.  That cannot
possibly be sustained after the evidence you have heard.
They did not.
So let's go back again to the Prime Minister
Theresa May in 2017 for a moment of clarity.  She said:
"Thousands of patients expected the world-class care
our NHS is famous for, but they were failed."
And we invite you to express those failings in the
strongest terms when you report.
Sir, after that introduction, let me pause for
a moment and step back before we dive in.  You know
that, with Mr Cummins and Dr Burin, instructed by
Collins, I represent more than a thousand of the
infected and affected Core Participants.  Our
Core Participants also include campaigning
organisations: Factor 8, Families and Friends of
Haemophilia Northern Ireland and The Fatherless
Generation.  And within those individuals are
a considerable number who have campaigned tirelessly fordecades as part of other groups such as Tainted Blood.
And we also represent the vast majority of the surviving
pupils and bereaved families of those who attended the
Lord Mayor Treloar school in Hampshire.
Now, some of those present, and perhaps more of
those watching online, whether the infected and affected
or members of the press, may not have watched every day
of the live stream.  We all know, here, that a public
inquiry is an unusual creature.  It is not litigation
between two competing parties in front of a judge
deciding between them.  You, sir, and your team of
counsel to the Inquiry, led by Ms Richards KC, have been
investigating -- and continue to investigate, as we
receive further documents from you even yesterday.  We,
by which I mean those Core Participants we represent,
have the role of being able to help, to assist, to offer
evidence, to invite you to look at particular issues.
You invited us to give you written submissions at
the conclusion of the oral evidence.  You asked us not
simply to regurgitate or recite back you to the evidence
you had heard.  You asked us to give you our Core
Participants' views on the issues which most concerned
them, both on what you should make as findings in your
report and what you should make as recommendations, and
we have tried to do that.Having seen the very substantial amounts of material
produced by all of the Core Participants, we can see you
have received submissions on all of the issues from
every perspective.  You have several thousand pages of
written submissions in total.  There may be differences
of emphasis and perhaps differences of some detail among
the recognised legal representatives who act for the
infected and affected, but I discern very little real
difference of substance among us.
I anticipate that each of those who represent the
infected and affected will bring a slightly different
perspective to what we say over the course of the next
three weeks.  For today we won't be repeating everything
we have said in writing, we know you have already read
it, but, like the approach of counsel to the Inquiry
when delivering presentations, we are fully aware this
is a public inquiry and a process by which what is said
is said in public, so we will touch on or allude to what
we wrote and we will spend a little bit more time on
some parts of it.  So we are trying to do what we did in
writing, only with even more focus, emphasising and
highlighting in this public forum what matters most to
our Core Participants.
So our intention today is to first of all summarise
very briefly what we've said in writing, emphasising key                
      9points, to dip in a little more detail into some areas.
We can't do them all but we are confident that you will
hear from other representatives over the next
three weeks on every area that concerns you.
Significantly though, today should be a chance to
respond to what the non-infected and affected Core
Participants have said in writing.  By that I mean
principally the Department of Health, as we call them.
Most of the time you will be hearing from me.  My
junior, Mr Cummins, is going to deal with the section
dealing with Lord Mayor Treloar school, probably after
the coffee break.
But before we begin, we do want to say, as we said
in writing -- to convey the thanks to you and to counsel
to the Inquiry publicly from our Core Participants.
Some have fought for more than 30 years for this
Inquiry, others for shorter times but no less
vigorously.  The analogy of David and Goliath, which of
course is the obvious one and is used in our
submissions, is entirely apt.  Long campaigning was
relentlessly pushed back against again and again and
again by governments -- and this is not a party
political point, by governments of all colours --
resisting an Inquiry until 2017.
Those campaigning have tried to piece together what 
    10some initially believed and, indeed, some who gave
evidence to you until very recently believed was simply
their own tragic experience.  That grew through
knowledge of others into an awareness of how widespread
this scandal was, with growing outrage, collaboration
and campaigning.  Even now though, attempts to get hold
of records, Freedom of Information Act requests, and so
on, are pushed back.
What you, sir, and your team have done and what my
Core Participants are enormously grateful for is
something like assembling a jigsaw.  The better analogy
perhaps is it is like assembling a jigsaw whose pieces
have been scattered through every room of the house.  So
you have our thanks for that: for what you have done,
for what you will do and, more significantly, for how
you have done it.
Let me tell you, if I may, briefly, what we are
going to focus on today.  I'm going to, in a moment,
focus on candour engagement from the Government and the
Government's response.  Then I'm going to spend
a moment, if I may, on the framework, we say, wraps
around the duty that rests on the Government and that
underpins its responsibility.
Then, I'm going to address you, time permitting --
or we are going to address you, time permitting -- on 
    11the topics which we have titled, in our written
submissions "People", that is the experience of the
infected and affected; "Myths and Lies", which is how we
have titled those assumptions, those unwritten
presuppositions that have grown up over time around this
scandal.  We are going to talk to you very briefly about
the Government and clinicians' response, about Treloar's
and, towards the end, we'll highlight aspects of what we
suggest you should find as recommendations and to do
with compensation, and then we will end, in time for
a further Core Participant to give his submissions this
afternoon.
Now, some parts we won't repeat in any detail today,
so, if you will forgive me, I am merely going to,
largely for the purpose of conveying them publicly,
emphasise some aspects of what we have said in writing
but won't delve deeply into.
First of all, the HIV Litigation.  We, the broad
point is, invite you to find the Government's approach
was wrong.
You can take comfort in so finding because of the
highly unusual intervention of the trial judge, Sir
Harry Ognall, into the litigation and the way in which
Lord Justice Ralph Gibson expressed his comments in the
Court of Appeal in September 1990.  Sir Harry Ognall 
    12said this:
"A Government which takes upon itself the role of a
public provider of medical advice and clinical services
is in a very different position to any commercial
organisation.  It is clearly arguable that their duty to
innocent citizens, who suffer injury under the aegis of
such treatment, has a moral dimension to it, which
should distinguish their assessment of their position
from the criteria to be adopted by defendants of
a corporate character.  Governments owe a duty wider
than to shareholders or insurers.  It should mean the
public may be entitled to expect from government
an appraisal of their position which is not confined
solely to legal principles to be found in the law of
negligence."
In the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Ralph Gibson
said this:
"It appears to be not in dispute that there was, in
fact, a failure to protect plaintiffs from the dangers
of using blood products, whether imported or supplied in
this country, which were infected."
Sir, the broad point, we say, is that those
plaintiffs, as they were then, claimants as they would
be now, should never have been made to litigate.  We are
not going to invite you and we don't invite you to go                
     13through the merits or demerits of the litigation; that
will be no part of your report I am sure.  But as
a matter of principle of approach and of the
government's attitude, we invite you to conclude that it
was wrong, inappropriate, as Mr Justice Ognall
indicated.
We note, a note in passing, sir, what now Sir Rupert
Jackson, then Rupert Jackson QC, said in his witness
statement before to you.  He said it is unfortunate that
the government of the day did not face up to its moral
responsibility in the same way the present Government
has, he said.  We wait with bated breath to see whether
that will be borne out.
Moving from the HIV litigation to self-sufficiency.
Again, in the briefest of summaries, as, sir, I hope you
understand, so we can then focus on other points in more
detail in due course.  What should self-sufficiency have
been?  We say it is very obvious from the evidence you
heard that, through the '70s and '80s, there was a drive
to provide as much factor concentrate as possible, in
part due to the business and the marketing efforts of
pharmaceutical companies, which stood to make
substantial profits from their sales.
In part, it was due to clinicians, whose enthusiasm
for being able to deliver what they believed were 
    14transformational products seemed to have blinded them to
the risks of those products.
In part, perhaps, it may indeed have been due to the
demands of patients who had been told that factor
products were miracles, without being told of the risks
associated with them.
Whatever the reason for which it occurred, it was
felt this perceived level of need -- which the Inquiry
knows was reported by UKHCDO clinicians to be rising,
year on year, from the late '70s, through the '80s -- it
was felt that was legitimate, desirable and unstoppable
and had to be met, whether by domestic production or
importing commercial products.  Our broad point on
self-sufficiency, which, sir, you will have seen
developed in writing, is that that is an example of the
tail wagging the dog.
We propose a counterfactual scenario in which the
clinicians and government ought to have appreciated that
all pooled factor concentrate carried a significantly
higher risk of harm through viral infection than single
donor cryoprecipitate.  They ought to have appreciated
that commercial products made in the United States
carried a very significantly higher risk of harm than
smaller pool UK factor concentrates, because of the
nature of the donors, the source of the donors, the pool 
    15sizes, these were all inherent features in the
commercialisation of blood and the sale and scale of the
manufacturing processes adopted in the US to maximise
yield and profit.
They ought -- "they", that is, the Government and
clinicians -- ought to have been aware that the viral
risks included what was then known as non-A, non-B
hepatitis -- we will come back and deal with this in
a little more detail later -- which should not even then
have been assumed to have been modest, mild, transient
or short-term.  No other hepatic virus was; why should
this one have been assumed to be?
Sir, we therefore say that the proper approach to
self-sufficiency ought to have been to have either not
used factor concentrates at all, unless and until such
time as the viral risks of non-A, non-B could be
eliminated, or, at worst, to have reserved concentrates
for the very most serious situations and most
exceptional cases of clinical need.  They should not
have been used daily, regularly, "thoughtlessly", is the
word we use.
When should that position have been appreciated, the
counterfactual scenario, and when, therefore, should
self-sufficiency on that basis have been achieved?  We,
sir, as you know, in writing take it right back to 1967 
    16when Dr Rosemary Biggs, respected doctor at Oxford,
wrote to the then Chief Medical Officer, Dr Godber in
August 1967.  She pointed out that the United Kingdom
had pioneered factor concentrate treatment, that there
was a shortage of it in England but her concern was that
US companies would shortly begin production.  Their
products would be expensive.  Everything should be done
to expedite the manufacture of these fractions in
England and in Scotland.
She considered that having pioneered the treatment,
the UK had the personnel who knew how to make it and had
enough plasma.  Although she expressed it in that letter
as a financial argument, her warnings about the
intrusion of United States companies must, to anyone
with clinical knowledge, such as the Chief Medical
Officer, have been understood to have included concerns
over the viral safety of the products, given what was
already known about the process of commercial blood
donation, collection and pooling in the States.  It is
possible, we say, that she framed her argument as
a financial one believing that was the language the
Government would best understand.
We say that was the first call to arms and the
self-sufficiency on the terms we have described it
should have been considered, thought about and                
     17implemented in or not very long after 1967.
We have urged on you in writing the retrospective
view of Dr Cash.  Sir, you will, I know, have seen that,
you will have remembered the article and you will have
recalled how it was addressed during Inquiry hearings.
He considered that there were a series of errors and
we urge you to consider them all in respect to
self-sufficiency.  But he described it this way: he said
the United States, US-imported products between 1972 and
1982 were "dirty blood, a sewer of viruses", and that
comes from a medical professional.
Moving from our summary of self-sufficiency to viral
inactivation.  Today is neither the time nor the place
to explore the details of our case on viral
inactivation.  We set that out in writing and we commend
that to you.
In respect of pharmaceutical companies, we summarise
again very briefly what we have said in writing in
chapter 11 of our written submissions.
The main impression that the Core Participants will
have taken from the evidence relating to pharma
companies during this Inquiry is, in fact, their failure
to participate, despite the fact that, we say, it must
be clear that they knew about the transmission of
hepatitis through blood products in the decades before 
    18the '70s.  They knew about the virtually universal
contamination of products with non-A, non-B hepatitis in
the '70s and '80s.  They were aware, as aware as
doctors, clinicians and regulatory bodies, of the
developing position with AIDS and the fact that it may
be transmitted by blood and blood products, and they
failed to give any or any adequate warnings in respect
of their products.  But we observe that those companies
have, we understand, watched but not actively
participated in any meaningful way in this Inquiry, and
we invite you to reach your own conclusions about what
we don't hesitate to describe as a cowardly stance.
Transfusion, sir, again ever so briefly.  We have
addressed that at chapter 12 of our written submissions.
We commend those to you.  The short sentence is this: as
one witness has told you, the safest transfusions is the
one not given.  The overall approach to transfusion, we
say, should have been to have considered the risks and
to have reduced blood use many decades before steps in
that direction were taken.
We have also set out some submissions in respect of
what you have heard described throughout this Inquiry as
"PUPs", previously untreated patients and, in respect of
other nonconsensual testing trials, studies and
experiments, again, sir, we commend to you chapter 14 of 
    19what we have written.  Today is not the moment to go in
detail through it but two points to pick out, really,
from it if I may.
First, is that, so often, you will have seen in
documents and even heard from witnesses language which
suggests that patients were commoditised for the
purposes of testing.
They were treated as a group.  They were treated as
a clinicians cohort, rather than as individuals.  They
were, in a sense almost traded with other clinicians
conducting trials to be offered for those clinicians'
trials.
We also flag up, as a second aspect of the testing,
Dr Craske's persistent and long studies.  Knowing what
he and other clinicians then knew or ought to have known
about non-A, non-B hepatitis, we say it is simply
unacceptable to have carried out long testing programmes
to see how individuals responded to hepatic risk.  The
simple point should have been they shouldn't have been
carried out at all.
Finally, in way of brief summary of what we say, I'm
not going to dwell at any greater length on consent,
communication and information sharing, which is how we
described chapter 15 of our written submissions to you.
We simply summarise it in this way: the evidence you 
    20have heard about the communication of adverse diagnoses
and, as well as that, that withholding of information on
diagnosis and risk demonstrates every variety of bad
practice.  The evidence you heard about how teenagers,
children, their families and spouses were told of fatal
diagnoses demonstrates an astonishing lack of care and
that diagnoses were communicated callously.
You have heard, sir, that they were communicated in
hospital corridors by nursing staff, they were
accidentally overheard, they were communicated months or
years after being known, they were discovered sometimes
by stickers on fridges or notes being left lying around.
We chose not, in writing, to summarise, and I won't
again orally, any further the evidence of the infected
and affected because, sir, I know you have that in mind
but we simply say this, we invite you to draw the
conclusion that the infected and affected suffered every
conceivable example of unethical practice about
communication or the absence of communication.
Sir, that's a summary of the things I'm not going to
dwell at any further length on, with an eye on the time
and hoping that we are heading in the right direction.
What I would like to do, if I may, is take you back to
the preliminary hearing, under the rubric of candour and
engagement from the Government.                
     21Sir, if we go back for a moment to September 2018
when you gave us the opportunity to make opening
statements at the preliminary hearing in Westminster
Hall.  We will suggest that what we then began to
outline to you, and others did too, has been entirely
borne out by your Inquiry and what evidence has been
unearthed over the last four years.
We suggested that complete trust placed by men,
women and children in their clinicians and in the State
has been broken, in that they were, without consent,
given products and blood, the risks of which were not
explained.  They were given no alternatives, no choices.
That, we say, has been borne out by the evidence you
heard.
We suggested to you then, even on the dearth of
evidence we had, that they had been subjected to
clinical tests and trials without proper consent or
proper knowledge and that again is borne out by the
evidence you have heard and we invite you to so find.
We suggested then that doctors were, at best,
mistaken and, at worst, took steps which were
substandard and unacceptable.  That also is borne out by
the evidence you have had heard, some of which evidence
shows catastrophic errors of judgement, ignorance of
accepted methods of treatment and even ignorance of 
    22material being disseminated by the UKHCDO.
We suggested to you then that the Government
response was disingenuous and inadequate and, again, we
submit that's borne out by the evidence that you have
heard.  You have seen, and we'll come back later this
morning to deal with, inconsistencies in the ways in
which civil servants dealt with information and their
communications with ministers.  
You've seen how assessments of clinical risk and
danger, most acutely in relation to the risks attendant
on HIV, were either unintentionally or intentionally
misexpressed so that an impression of far lower risk was
conveyed than was really warranted.  We suggested then
that politicians responsible for health took wrong
decisions in conjunction with their civil servants and
have since been covering up.  Again, we suggest that is
borne out by the evidence you have heard.
I chose to address you at the preliminary hearing on
what I then called the narrative of necessity and
I suggested you should look at it with real scepticism.
That is the account which has developed that factor
concentrates were a wonder product that simply had to be
developed and deployed, that they were life saving, that
haemophiliacs would have died without them.  Whereas, we
suggest then and we suggest now, that they are not truly 
    23needed at all, still less when compared with the risks
they carried.  We said then and we continue to say, and
I will develop later this morning, that the existing
treatment of cryoprecipitate was significantly safer.
Again, we suggested the shift from single blood
donors to buying commercial factor concentrates brought
with it entirely foreseeable and hugely increased risks
of viral transmission and infection, and that the
consequences of those viruses were appreciated in the
1970s and before.  We will come back again to that later
today.
Let's turn, if we may, to what I said at the
preliminary hearing about candour and engagement.
Lawrence, I wonder if we could have COLL0000025, please,
page 3.  Sir, you will recall we took you to the report
of the Right Reverend James Jones, the former Bishop of
Liverpool, into the experiences of the families who had
been involved in the Hillsborough disaster, and we
suggest that his conclusions are all the more resonant
today, having heard the evidence from the infected and
affected, which you have heard over the last four years.
May we look at page 7, please, where, sir, you will
see if we go to the third paragraph please.  He said
this -- and, sir, this touches, first of all, on candour
but, secondly, on how you yourself will in due course 
    24express your report and your conclusions:
"In this report I do not pretend to speak for the
families.  But I have listened to what they have said to
me.  I urge you [the Prime Minister and Home Secretary
to whom he is writing] to help ensure that those
responsible for our national institutions listen to what
the experiences of the Hillsborough families say about
how they should conduct themselves when faced by
families bereaved by public tragedy."
The situation is clearly analogous to that which we
are in today.  Could we turn over to the bottom of
page 8 and the penultimate paragraph:
"The Hillsborough families [he said] are not the
only ones who have suffered from [what he called] 'the
patronising disposition of unaccountable power'."
A term which resonates with the experience of the
Core Participants in your Inquiry.  He said there:
"The families know that there are others who have
found that when in all innocence and with a good
conscience they have asked questions of those in
authority on behalf of those they love the institution
has closed ranks, refused to disclose information, used
public money to defend its interests and acted in a way
that was both intimidating and oppressive."
Again, sir, we say that clearly resonates with the                
     25experience of our Core Participants here.
Could we please turn to page 13, internal page 7.
Sir, you will recall that in the opening in the
preliminary hearing I took you to this, which is what he
proposed as a charter for families bereaved through
public tragedy and we laid down the challenge to
Government bodies to comply with that in your Inquiry.
They said they would and we are entitled, therefore, to
scrutinise whether they have done and do.  You will see
there that he invites the public body to: 
"... commit to ... becoming an organisation which
strives to: 
"1.  In the event of a public tragedy ... support
the bereaved and to protect the vulnerable.
"2.  Place the public interest above [its] own
reputation.
"3.  Approach forms of public scrutiny -- including
public inquiries and inquests -- with candour, in
an open, honest, and transparent way ...
"6.  Recognise that we are accountable and open to
challenge.  We will ensure that processes are in place
to allow the public to hold us to account for the work
we do and for the way in which we do it."
So at the outset, sir, I'm going to look at the
Government's response, first at what they have done 
    26during this Inquiry and what the Government has said in
Parliament and elsewhere, and done or not done in
respect of the recommendations of Sir Robert Francis as
to a compensation framework; and, secondly, what they
have said in their submissions now.
I will deal with the first, more briefly perhaps,
than I intended.
How Government has acted so far.  We say that
candour is not simply giving up or surrendering
documents or providing witnesses.  We say that it is
being fair, open minded and treating the Core
Participants in this Inquiry with respect, and that that
has not been done.
Sir Robert Francis, sir, as you know, was required
by the Government to produce a wholly independent report
into a framework for compensation.  He felt it vital to
say the infected and affected should be involved in and
have confidence in that process and we say that is what
has been missing so far in the Government's interaction
with campaigners and with the infected and affected
during the latter course of this Inquiry.
I don't hesitate to describe the government's
approach in this respect as the combination of the two
words "patronising" and "condescending" that we have
used elsewhere in our written submissions.  Their 
    27approach has been to brush away concerns and to give no
detail, in effect saying: Don't worry, we're treating
this seriously, we'll do the right thing.
And they have said to a community of people to whom
the government had self-evidently not done the right
thing for decades, so it is something of a hollow
promise.
We have been told that the government can't say
anything about the shape or scope of the compensation
scheme which Sir Robert proposed, which you and counsel
to the Inquiry have scrutinised, which we as legal
representatives for the infected and affected have
scrutinised, on which we have spent days of time.  Yet
we are told that multiple departments of government have
been beavering away for months, but, strikingly, no sign
of involvement of the infected and affected and no clue
of what they have been working on, save again to say:
Don't worry, we are doing the right thing.
The question of recommendations and compensation is
a huge part of your work, of the work of this Inquiry.
Sir, we ask how difficult can it really be to see that
a public inquiry is precisely the forum in which the
government's past performance should be called into
question, and there should be all the more reason to be
open, frank, candid, helpful and proactive about those 
    28very significant issues of compensation, redress and
other recommendations.
We'd been promised the government would respond to
his report with a response.  That is, setting out the
government's view.  Before Sir Robert Francis gave
evidence, they didn't.  They haven't since.
In terms of timescale, sir, you know the government
got Sir Robert Francis' report in March of 2022, almost
a full year ago.  We were told by the then Paymaster
General that they would publish the government's
response alongside Sir Robert Francis' report.  That
then changed, in a letter to the all-party APPG, to the
government publishing its response in time for you, the
Infected Blood Inquiry and Core Participants, to
consider that government response before
Sir Robert Francis gave his evidence.  That didn't
happen.  Another broken promise.
The government only published his report
three months after they got it and four weeks before he
gave his evidence.  Again the Paymaster then, the
Paymaster General, said the government was considering
his recommendations and it was most important that the
government could reflect on his evidence and that of
others.  We pause for a moment and wonder: Who?
We are not told.                
     29Finally, after a Westminster Hall debate, we have
a statement in the House of Commons.  And I emphasise
this again only because it is such a key part of the
work of your Inquiry and is so concerning, as you will
appreciate, to the Core Participants, the infected and
affected.
The statement in the House of Commons was a formal
statement on 15 December 2022 from Jeremy Quin, current
Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General.
That, funnily enough, was the day before the deadline
for closing submissions to be lodged with you.  We say
colloquially the government has form for that.  It
announced parity in the vaguest of terms just before
Matt Hancock gave evidence to you, and it increased
payments, press release, just before the first day of
the victims' evidence in 2019.  Those, we say, are signs
of a government not willing to act proactively for the
benefit of the infected and affected.  What do we know
from December and the House of Commons?  We know
precious little actually, and I'm doing this to
foreshadow how little we can add to it from the
government's response to you in this Inquiry.
We know that the government for the first time
recognises a moral case for the payment of compensation.
We see that the government say they want to be prepared 
    30to act quickly when you report.  It tells us they have
committed to use the Sir Robert Francis study to prepare
for the outcome of the Langstaff Inquiry.  One asks
rhetorically: What does that mean?
Sir Robert's report is detailed but not complete.
It is a framework, it is not the finished article.  So
where, we ask, is the difficulty in saying in principle
whether it is accepted in full or in part or which bits
or which aspects or which heads of loss?  Or, even at
the basic level, Sir Robert's proposed uprating and
harmonisation of annual payments.  It is not clear still
whether the government proposes to include or would
commit to including parents who have lost children or
children who lost parents within the scheme.
We simply cannot explain why we are in the dark.
They have made interim payments but one asks again
rhetorically: Interim to what?  They haven't told us
what comes next.  The only impression we say can be
taken is they don't want their views on compensation,
most of which must surely be formed by now, to be
subject to scrutiny, question and analysis in as public
a forum as this Inquiry.  Is that good faith?  Is that
candour?  Come back to Bishop Jones, is that supporting
the bereaved, protecting the vulnerable, approaching
public scrutiny with candour or allowing the public to 
    31hold them to account?
Sir, we see a real risk that this Inquiry -- sir,
you have set yourself a mammoth task, we know that --
will necessarily take some time to report.  And your
conclusions may then not be swiftly or properly accepted
or implemented.  That will all take time.  But time, as
you know from the beginning of our written submissions,
is something that many of those most grievously injured
and affected simply do not have.
So at the very end of our written submissions and at
the end of today I am going to make two suggestions
about how to deal with that uncertainty which bedevils
the Core Participants, and with the delay likely to be
inherent -- likely, I say, from the way the government
have behaved so far.  We will suggest two things.
First, that you might take the approach of issuing
a further interim report recommending further interim
payments now.  Secondly, perhaps more dramatically, the
possibility of an early interim report in which you set
out a full -- your recommendation as to a full
compensation scheme, so that before the Inquiry closes
finally you will have set out your views on
an appropriate compensation and redress.  That could
then be responded to by the government before the
Inquiry finally wraps up.  And you would then preserve 
    32the ability to call before you the authors of the
government response so that we can then all publicly
scrutinise in the way that they promised we would at the
outset.
Let me move from that, if I may, to the government's
position in its written submissions to you.  That
discussion of candour and openness leads directly to
this topic.  First of all, we describe it as sitting on
the fence or, more colloquially, having their cake and
eating it.  Sitting on the fence is committing to
neither option.  Having your cake and eating it is
enjoying both.
The blood transfusion services have given you
a detailed response throughout parts of which they
accept they could have done this sooner or that later,
they could have done this in a different way, they may
not have done.  There has been a detailed analysis and
a presentation of their case.  That is what they say.
The UKHCDO have given you essentially a very long
chronology, although we say it is curiously sparing in
places.  There is simply one paragraph identifying the
critical Heathrow meeting and saying no more about it
than that.  And they offer you no help on conclusions.
But our most significant issue is the response of the
Department of Health and the government.                
     33With the greatest of respect for their advocates,
their submissions seem to seek to face two ways at once,
and it is, we say, wholly inconsistent with adopting
a position of neutrality or sympathy.  On the one hand
they say the current government has no case or
position -- that is page 15 of their submissions -- and
that it is entirely for you to make your mind up.  But
then they devote 600 pages to restating and seeking to
justify the position of government witnesses and the
politicians who gave evidence.
We pause to observe that, sir, you will recall,
almost all of the witnesses, for instance
Baroness Hooper springs to mind, say that they
themselves actually have no recollection at all of any
of this, and what they have done is simply been provided
with a lot of documents by the government legal
department and then produced a detailed statement
crafted from those records.
Sir, the distinction, we say, between the current
governments and previous governments is both artificial
and spurious.  It is and always has been the
government -- or the Department of Health, under
whatever name it traded -- throughout the years through
which you are concerned.  It has been a continuous
entity. 
    34We ask where is the self scrutiny or the reflection
or any sign that they have listened or taken account of
their evidence in their submissions?  There is none,
because they seek to steer between saying, on the one
hand, "We present no case", yet on the other dissecting
the evidence.
We, it's fair to say, expected something candid.  We
expected a position from the government.  Perhaps that
they knew this by then, or they should have realised
that by then, or perhaps done better in this respect, or
that they support their position in other respects by
other reasons.
Now, Ms Grey KC accepted at the preliminary hearing,
she said:
"... on behalf of my clients, I [say these] words,
the acceptance that this should not have happened, is an
acceptance that things went wrong.  Things happened that
should not have happened and so, on behalf of my
clients, I say, unreservedly, that we are sorry.  We are
sorry that this should be so, that this happened when it
should not have done."
What things?  What is the "it"?
You can search their submissions, as, sir, I know
you will have done, and we found no significant
concession or acceptance or identification of what went 
    35wrong.  What the things are that should not have
happened.  All we can see on the analysis we have done
is they accept that it was wrong to have lost
individuals' medical records and it was probably wrong
not to have held an Inquiry sooner, although it was
reasonable not to have done so in the circumstances.
That is, with respect, we say, hopeless.
We know that David Cameron apologised at
Prime Minister's Questions in March of 2015, after the
Penrose Report, using similar sorts of language.  He
said at the end of what he said:
"To each and every one of those people I would like
to say sorry on behalf of the Government for something
that should not have happened."
Reading these submissions, one wonders what he was
apologising for.  It is not as cheap -- it cannot
possibly be as cheap or as meaningless an apology as,
"I am sorry that you are upset".  It just can't be.
An apology is only an apology if it accepts that
something was indeed wrong or should not have happened
and that the person responsible for that wrong accepts
what they did and knows what they did.
So what, in these submissions, does the government
accept responsibility for?
We aren't told. 
    36The government's submissions attempt to hold the
utterly unsustainable line that they support and endorse
the Inquiry but at the same time have no case.  How can
that be?

--Result #819--
   Yes, but we are not told what the wrong is.  We
don't know the respects in which they accept things were
wrong.  Which makes it very difficult indeed for us to
address you today in respect of our case.  We have all
heard the evidence.  We are telling you the conclusions
we invite you to draw from it.  They don't.  They simply
say: We have no case and this is what the evidence said.
So, sir, I do it this way, if I may.  I express the
hope that we will hear from Ms Grey tomorrow in relation
to, for instance, compensation or recommendations.
Because we note that at paragraph 1.11 of her
submissions she accepts that those ministers she
represents, the current DHSC ministers, will be involved
in decision making on recommendations.  She is in
a position to comment.
So what we do is this, we invite Ms Grey tomorrow to
answer for us and for you and so that those who
represent the infected and affected, who will speak
after me over the next three weeks, know what the                
     37position is.
Question 1: What did David Cameron apologise for in
2015 and Ms Grey continued to apologise for on their
behalf in 2018?  May we have the detail?
2: What things do the government accept happened
that should not have happened?  Let's have the detail.
Let's see what is accepted.
3: What things does the government accept went
wrong?  Again, let's have that detail.
4: Can she confirm, as Matt Hancock said to you when
he gave evidence in his role as Secretary of State for
Health, that the government will implement whatever
recommendations for compensation the Inquiry makes?
As part of that, can she confirm whether
compensation will extend to parents who lost children,
children who lost parents, and carers, all categories of
people who have been excluded from the support scheme so
far?
5: And let's take a detailed example on which they
were silent, on what date does the DHSC accept that its
predecessor knew that non-A, non-B was a condition which
could have serious and long-term consequences?  Let's
know what they say.
And finally 6: When and on what date does the DHSC
accept that its predecessor knew that pooling plasma 
    38increased the risk of post-transfusion hepatitis?
Those will all have been things it would have been
enormously helpful to have known before today.  So we
could see where there's common ground.  So we can see
where there are issues and we can address them.
Sir, that's the challenge, with the greatest of
respect, for my learned friend, for Ms Grey, for
tomorrow.
What else do we say about the government response?
Well, sir, you have read the first 20 pages of it.
Apart from the recitation thereafter of what the
witnesses say, there are some areas which we can
identify as submissions and which you have asked us and
other Core Participants to respond to.  That's part of
the purpose of standing here on my feet speaking to you
today, is to respond to what each of us has put in
writing.  There are some areas where the government
actually advances a case and asks the Inquiry to take
a particular approach.  What do we say about them?
First of all, there is considerable reference to delay,
to the passage of years and the fading of memories, and
an urging upon you of caution.
Now, we pause to say for a moment that's hardly fair
because that's their fault.  If it is right to grant
an Inquiry in 2017, it would have been right in 2007. 
    39It would have been right ten years earlier, in 1997.
The suggestion that it is right now but was reasonable
not to have done before is not really understood by us.
It cannot be right -- and, sir, you know from your
long judicial experience that in Common Law it is not --
to allow a party responsible for a delay to profit from
it.  In other words, the government can't be allowed to
say that it should have the benefit of any doubt or
uncertainty in what is now old evidence, missing
documents and faded recollections when it itself caused
that delay.
We suggest that not only would that be abhorrent on
the facts of this Inquiry, it would also set the most
unfortunate precedent, because most public inquiries
consider whether the emanation of the state is at fault
for something; it cannot be right that the same state
which decides whether an inquiry should be held at all
should receive any evidential benefit from delaying the
holding of that inquiry.
Their submissions invite you to keep the events in
perspective.  The events of the day.  The standards of
the time.  Sir, we simply say in response to that that
we invite you to consider that that is no problem.  That
is what judges do all the time.  Part of my practice has
involved litigating over industrial disease cases, where 
    40one looks at the evidence, the standards, the procedures
of 30, 40, sometimes even more years before.  It is
a task that falls regularly to judges.  You are no
stranger to it and so we are confident you will do it
well.  So that is the short response to that
encouragement from the Department of Health.
Finally, they urge upon you by reference to a case
called Gestmin -- and now is not the time or the place,
again, for legal analysis of propositions of law -- but
I urge upon you to consider the passage of time on
recollection and accuracy.  In a sense, as I understand
their submission, it is to be more lenient on their
witnesses who had no particular recollection or told you
they had no recollection on certain issues.
Now, with the greatest of respect, again, we say the
analysis of that case is mistaken, in that it cannot be
elevated to some binding principle circumscribing how
you should approach the evidence.
Sir, there are more than I will mention but a number
of recent authorities providing a riposte to the
overplaying, as we say it is, of the Gestmin case.  Most
significantly it is a case called Solicitors Regulation
Authority v Day, 2018, where Lord Justice Davis says:
"Gestmin, helpful though it is in providing
guidance, does not demand rigid and unqualified                
     41acceptance by the court of the literal meaning of a word
in a contemporaneous document if the true analysis of
the circumstances in which it was used, including [where
it appears and so on] suggests that it was the wrong
word to use ..."
So there is no rigid principle that you must
approach evidence in a particular way.  Similarly,
Lord Justice Floyd in a case called Kogan v Martin:
"Gestmin is not to be taken as laying down any
general principle for the assessment of evidence.  It is
one of a line of distinguished judicial observations
that emphasise the fallibility of human memory and the
need to assess witness evidence in its proper place
alongside contemporaneous documentary evidence and
evidence upon which undoubted or probable reliance can
be placed.  Earlier statements of this kind are
discussed in Lord Bingham in his well-known essay The
Judge as Juror ..."
I will take it no further than that.
Sir, insofar as there is a submission to respond to,
this is our response to it.  You are not bound to do
anything other than the normal job of a judge, to see
things in their context, to assess all the evidence in
its proper surroundings.
Sir, that's all I intend to say about the 
    42government's response.  What I'm going to do is to move
very briefly, I hope -- let me check our timing -- very,
very briefly to consider the framework for a moral duty
or a duty on the government.
Sir, you have seen how we set this out in our
written submissions.  Former minister after former
minister gave evidence before you and there was
an acceptance that the government owed and had breached
a moral duty.  For instance Matt Hancock on 21 May 2021.
He referred to the errors that led to this harm on
people's lives but a sense that redress was not properly
considered.  Ms Richards asked:
"Do you consider -- and this is a question addressed
to you, Mr Hancock ..."
You will recall that Mr Vineall sat beside him.
"... that there is a moral responsibility on
Government to address the impact of what's happened to
those infected and affected?"
Mr Hancock:
"Yes, I do."
Now, we suggest, and other Core Participants suggest
more, that there is indeed a legal duty, but we know
that you won't find civil -- you are precluded from
finding civil or criminal liability, so we leave it
there for now, but in our written submissions we develop 
    43the framework for moral duty, looking at, first of all,
the constitution of the NHS.  We look at the World
Health Organization constitution and other things.
It may be helpful -- yes, if time permits, we will
look at the World Health Organization constitution,
which is COLL0000020.
Sir, I put it on screen now, I will take us only to
a couple of pages because it hasn't been touched upon by
the Inquiry before and, insofar as ministers accepted
responsibility, I think it is important for us to see
where that acceptance may stem from.
You will see, sir, this may be familiar to you,
I know it will be because you have read our submissions,
the World Health Organization came into being
immediately after the Second World War in 1946.
We see that the document I'm taking you to is the
records, the final minutes and acts, what was done at
the International Health Conference in New York in
July 1946.
Can we look at page 5, please, top left, please.
You will see, six lines down:
"The Conference, recognising the vital importance of
health as a factor in the promotion of 'conditions of
stability [remember this is just after the Second World
War] and wellbeing' for the nations of the world, 
    44included 'health' among the fields of co-operative
endeavour with which the United Nations system should
concern itself."
If we can then -- we will skip through some of the
rest but we will look, if we may, please, at page 100,
where we see in the top half of the page:
"Text of the Constitution of the World Health
Organization."
Sir, we commend this to you, insofar as you feel you
need to undertake an analysis of the duties or
responsibilities of a State, the State, our State, being
developed and being rolled out through clinical and
governmental services.
Sir, you will see there:
"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and
social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease
or infirmity."
This is the Constitution of the World Health
Organization to which, as a nation, we signed:
"The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of
health is one of the fundamental rights of every human
being without distinction of race, religion, political
belief, economic or social condition."
The final of those small indented paragraphs:
"Governments have a responsibility for the health of                
     45their peoples which can be fulfilled only by the
provision of adequate health and social measures."
Sir, that's our starting point: on the international
stage, there is a responsibility on the Government to
secure the complete physical, mental and social
wellbeing, not merely the absence of disease or
infirmity.
May we look, please, at COLL0000021.  Again, we see
the front page, just for the moment.  This is the NHS
Constitution for England.  Simply touching on and
developing, if I may, what we say in our written
submissions, there is a constitution.  It has been
revised periodically.  It will continue no doubt to be
revised periodically but, insofar as there is
a constitution, we say it represents and must represent
what always has been understood to be the role of the
NHS and its duties, in the broadest sense.
It also, this constitution, refers not only to
duties and rights but pledges, which it recognises go
above and beyond legal rights.  Sir, what I hope I'm
illustrating or laying out for your consideration is
a structure by which, as a nation, we have taken
responsibility for procuring these aspects of our
citizens' health and wellbeing and then, on a closer
level, within the NHS. 
    46If we look at page 3, please, we see at the top of
the page there:
"The NHS belongs to the people.
"It is there to improve our health and wellbeing,
supporting us to keep mentally and physically well, to
get better when we are ill and, when we cannot fully
recover, to stay as well as we can to the end of our
lives.  It works at the limits of science -- bringing
the highest levels of human knowledge and skill to save
lives and improve health.  It touches our lives at times
of basic human need, when care and compassion are what
matter most."
Sir, you will see -- I won't take you to the rest of
it -- but over the successive pages there are pledges
and expressions of rights.  We say, first of all, that
this represents, and has always at the material times
this Inquiry is concerned with, represented a pledge,
a commitment and an obligation of one sort or another,
whether truly legal or whether moral or both, on the
part of the Government and the NHS, to safeguard the
population in the broadest sense of that word.
We say, as you will have seen from other aspects of
the NHS Constitution, which I won't take time on at the
moment, if you fail you come clean: a duty of candour.
In that respect, I would like to take you, if I may, 
    47very briefly to three short documents in respect of
candour and engagement, when a government has breached
its basic duty of supporting our health and wellbeing.
Can we go to JEVA0000096, please.
This is a note, sir, you will see, from the bottom
of the page, 26 September 1985, written by someone in
the Department of Health, notes about a diary meeting.
Middle paragraph:
"My own feeling on this is that the Prime Minister
should [steer] clear of AIDS (!), even when it is
a question of opening laboratories to help innocent
victims.  I think this is ... something for Norman
Fowler.  If she is going to do a medical visit, I should
prefer to suggest opening a hospital, or a home for
children with incurable diseases, etc.  Furthermore,
I do not think we could entertain the idea of a visit to
Elstree shall (where the lab is) [and we all know what
they're talking about there] without existing it with
something else."
So, sir, what we have here is, at a stage at
which -- a critical stage after AIDS has become
apparent, we have a reluctance to be involved in
scrutiny or to engage openly or to be seen to be
associated with things which might be considered to have
gone wrong. 
    48Can we have, please, DHSC0003961_011.
This, sir, you will see is a letter of
2 November 1987, written from -- you will see the name
at the bottom -- John Major, then Chancellor, to Tony
Newton, Minister of State in the Department of Health
and Social Security.  You have seen this in the course
of the evidence that you have received in this Inquiry
but it relates to the suggestion that the Minister
should meet with campaigners from The Haemophilia
Society in 1987.  Sir, again, you will see there the
penultimate paragraph:
"I therefore suggest that you and John Moore should
listen only at this stage, and that the most you should
say is that you will consider the points made by the
Society, with no implication that the Government will
take action."
Sir, that's not engaging.  That is not accepting
responsibility.  That is not engaging with candour.
Finally, on this topic, may we look at COLL0000023,
please.  This is the then Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher herself, on 28 June 1990, writing to David
Watters of The Haemophilia Society, and this is perhaps
one of the first occasions on which a request for
an Inquiry was rebuffed:
"Thank you for your letter of 1 June asking for                
     49a special inquiry into the haemophiliac claim for
compensation."
Bottom paragraph on that first page, please:
"I am, therefore, not clear precisely what question
you envisage a special inquiry would be asked to
examine.  If an inquiry were to attempt to establish
whether there had been any negligence, either in general
or for particular categories of claimants, it would need
to sift through exactly the same kind of evidence as the
present legal action.  It is not clear that this would
either lead to a quicker outcome or one more generally
accepted as fair.  If, on the other hand, the inquiry
were to consider whether, in this special case,
compensation should be given without proof of negligence
that would open up some very broad and difficult issues
and could indeed require reopening the whole question of
no-fault compensation.  Again, it is not clear that this
would result in a quicker outcome than the court
action ...
"I am sorry if this is a disappointing reply."
Sir, we put those before you, that accumulation of
material, some of which you have seen before some of
which you haven't, to, we hope, make good our contention
for the underpinning of the duty that politicians have
accepted rests with them; the duty that they now have 
    50and accept to compensate; and the paucity of response to
it to date.
Sir, one final point and that simply is this, and it
is a legal point, so I mention it only briefly, as it is
not my intention to lecture today.  We say, in our
submissions, that not only is this a commonsense
approach, that if you are responsible for something and
it goes wrong, you say sorry quickly and you make
amends, but you are responsible for it.
We say it also chimes with judicial authority, for
instance, the position of rescuers at Common Law.  Sir,
you know what I mean and I don't need to deploy it any
further than that.  Put simply, you are liable if you
make someone else's predicament worse and we say that is
what the Government, through its Civil Service, through
the Department of Health, through the clinicians, have
done in this case: they have made the position, the
predicament of the haemophiliacs and others worse.
Sir, I'm not going to say more about that aspect.
Sir, I have an eye on the time, I have been learning
from watching Ms Richards how one stands here and what
one is supposed to do.  I'm about to start something
which I think will take more than five minutes.  Would
you like to break now?

--Result #820--
   Sir, yes, I'm going to pick up with where
I left off.
The next section we're going to deal with is one
which in our written submissions we used the curious
title of "Myths and Lies", and it was chapter 3 of our
written submissions, which, again, I know you have in
mind, sir, having read it.  Not everybody here will
have, and I'm going to explain what we mean by that in
this way.  
40 years or more have passed since some of the key
events this Inquiry is considering, and we and my Core
Participants believe that over that period of time,
either intentionally or unintentionally, certain
inaccurate and untrue points of view and assertions have
taken root and become entrenched as established
thinking, sometimes seemingly unchallenged as gospel
truth.  And those are the sorts of things that we refer
to as myths and lies in this section.
Sir, as you know, the Inquiry has already
scrutinised many of these, not only the truth with the
benefit of hindsight, but by assessing what was known at 
    62the time when these assertions were first made.
Our Core Participants asked us to identify a number
of these so that you could focus on them, deal with them
specifically and, again, if you forgive the vernacular,
call them out for what they are.
It is important to our Core Participants as part of
the function and purpose of this Inquiry that the record
is set straight on these issues unequivocally and
finally.
Again, sir, I approach this on the basis that you
invited us not simply to regurgitate evidence to you but
to focus on the conclusions we invite you to draw.  So
just to summarise or identify the sort of things I mean
as myths and lies, I will list them, and then we are
going to look at two of them in a little bit of detail,
and then in 16/17 minutes' time I will hand over to
Mr Cummins.
The sorts of things we are talking about, sir,
I know you will have read, are the often promulgated
story -- you heard it from Lord Kenneth Clarke -- all
this was just unavoidable.  We are very clearly inviting
you to conclude that that is simply untrue and
inaccurate.  It was not unavoidable.  It was not in line
with the best possible standards of the time.
Again, other examples of other myths and lies that 
    63have taken hold is that factor concentrates were
essential.  Again, sir, that is harking back slightly to
what I called the narrative of necessity in our opening.
We will come back to look at that in a little bit more
detail in terms of consideration of the respective
merits and demerits of cryoprecipitate as against factor
concentrates.
There are some substrata to that, that factor
concentrates were essential, one is the oft-repeated
story that haemophiliacs would die if not given
concentrates.  And you saw that played out in the
evidence of Lord Glenarthur, Lord Clarke and others,
whose understanding was any move away from concentrates
would be fatal for a very large number of haemophiliacs.
Another aspect of the cryoprecipitate story is that
it is often said that it wouldn't have been desirable to
go back to it.  Patients didn't want to go back to it.
You heard that from some clinicians, although whether
based on fact or based on supposition it's not clear and
wasn't clear in their evidence.  The suggestion that
cryoprecipitate was too old-fashioned, too cumbersome,
fraught with problems or that it simply couldn't be
done, that we wouldn't have had the processes to make
it.
So that is part of the cryoprecipitate bundle of 
    64myths and lies.
Others, though, are that patients themselves were
aware of and chose to run the risk of concentrates.  We
talked about that already, so that scarcely needs to be
said to be dismissed.
That there was "no conclusive proof" of the link
between blood, blood products and HIV infection.  Now,
that is a very big story which, as you know, you heard,
and it was examined in detail by counsel to the Inquiry
with Lord Clarke and others, as to how that line to
take, of no conclusive proof, was maintained for so long
and in such a misleading way.
Tying in partly with what I suggested was the first
lie or myth, that this was all unavoidable, is that
the -- another one is the risks of viruses in
concentrates weren't known.  Those two tie together and
I will deal with those together in a moment.  Another
oft-repeated one is that there would have been
insufficient blood donors to have done anything else.
We see that, and into an assertion at several
stages, that there were fear that we could not restrict
the groups of those who could donate when surrogate
screening was being considered for HCV and so on.
Lord Owen, his evidence to you was that, as far as
he was concerned, he believed sufficient voluntary                
     65donors would step up.  And there is, in fact, no -- we
say no cogent evidence at all to support the suggestion
that there would have been insufficient blood donors had
a different course been taken.
Other myths and lies: it has not been possible to
offer compensation because legal liability has not been
admitted.  Suggested that we couldn't do it because
legal liability had been admitted in the Republic of
Ireland.  But Mr O'Mahoney, in his evidence, told you
that was not so; a proper compensation scheme was set up
there despite the non-admission of legal liability at
the time.
Further myths and lies: haemophiliacs were fully
compensated by the combination of the settlement of the
HIV Litigation and the funding of the MFT.  We know that
simply not to be true.  A simple cursory look at the
figures, and your record of the evidence shows that.
Another, that no-fault compensation simply could not
be paid for fear of setting of precedent.  Again,
Lord Waldegrave, David Mellor and others expressed the
view that no-fault compensation could indeed have been
paid.  Lord Waldegrave explained that it might have been
in the government's interest that it was capable of
moving with the times, understanding concerns and making
an exception to a general rule. 
    66One more, before I come back to the detail of two of
them, is that throughout the last year, or two or three
or four, that the Inquiry has been going, the government
has been providing support for all the affected and
bereaved.  Sir, again, you know, but we invite you to
record specifically, that is simply not the case.
Parent who lost children, children who lost parents,
adult carers for their own parents, for example, are all
excluded from current support schemes or at least from
the majority of them.
I'm going to dip back, very briefly, into two of the
myths and lies.  The first is the combination of the lie
that this was all inevitable and that the risks and
viruses weren't known.  Now, again, sir, I'm very
mindful indeed of not regurgitating back you to the
evidence that you have heard.
Sir, others have tracked it through perhaps in
a little more detail than we did in our written
submissions, so it's simply to summarise the position
for those listening in this way.  We go right back to
1946 -- sir, as you will no doubt recall yourself -- the
British Medical Journal article linking serum hepatitis
and pool sizes.  Nothing has changed in the science
since 1946.  The science has always been that for
jaundice or hepatitis, the larger the pool the greater 
    67the hepatitis risk.  So the basis of any assertion that
there was no risk obvious or it was all unavoidable,
depends on using a product which is derived from large
pools.  If you don't do that, the risk is gone.  So
that's the foundation for that argument.
We then would take you through a series of steps,
all of which I am sure, sir, you will be familiar with,
so I simply say them so they are recorded on the
transcript as being the way in which we see the
knowledge of non-A, non-B developing and of its
seriousness.
The next step we would particularly refer you to
would be Rosemary Biggs' letter of August 1967, we've
mentioned it earlier, warning that the market would be
flooded with US commercial concentrates from more than
a million donors a year -- I don't think that is
an individual pool; I think that might be the totality
of the donors in the States -- and that if we in the UK
did not get our house in order we would be obliged to
buy it from the States.  It was extraordinarily
prescient in 1967.  It is, in fact, one of the
underlying keys to the scandal of what happened.
Next we would take you to -- and, again, sir, I am
sure you will have all the references; if not, we will
provide a short list of them in due course -- an 
    68April 1974 letter from Judith Pool at Stanford Medical
Centre in California, to the United States Government,
when they were considering relaxing their National Blood
Policy.  She described it as a new National Blood Policy
that in no way requires or even encourages volunteer
blood for this purpose but assumes the continuation of
what she described as "dangerous, expensive, wasteful
and unethical purchase of plasma by pharmaceutical
houses to provide this therapeutic material".
Even in 1974, clear references to the danger of
going down this route.  We then have, sir, as you well
know, the Prince paper in The Lancet, in August 1974,
identifying non-A, non-B.  Linking of significantly
greater incidents of non-A, non-B to blood from
commercial sources.
We have, in January 1975, again, from Stanford
University Medical Centre, Garrott Allen's letter of
6 January 1975.  Simply, if I may, to read out loud, so
that, again, we are in the public domain, he says this,
in the midst of his letter -- he is talking about
a particular product, Konyne, Factor IX product produced
by Cutter.  He says:
"As you know, Cutter's product Konyne, for Factor IX
deficiency, has proved extraordinarily hazardous, 50 to
90% rate of icteric hepatitis developing from it.  About                
     69half of these cases prove fatal.  Cutter's source of
blood is 100% from skid row derelicts [he says]."

--Result #821--
  Between 1976 and 1984 he was treated on
three occasions with Factor VIII concentrate, a product
developed to treat haemophilia.  At least one of the
Factor VIII treatments he was given was contaminated
with hepatitis C.  In 1994, he was diagnosed with
hepatitis C.  As a result of the infection with
hepatitis C he suffered a variety of mental and physical
symptoms which impacted on his university education, his
career, his marriage his ability to have children.
There was little or no support available and the stigma 
   140of the virus created isolation, frustration and sadness
at the loss of a life imagined.  He subsequently
developed cirrhosis, a recognised complication of
hepatitis C.  He was also diagnosed with cancer of the
liver and portal hypertension.  Both conditions are
complications of cirrhosis."
There is then a further description of the medical
treatment that was involved in the final days and hours.
If we scroll down to the very bottom of the screen as it
shows at the moment:
"Stephen Dymond's death is the direct consequence of
being given Factor VIII between 1976 and 1984 which was
contaminated with hepatitis C."
Again, I sought express permission to show this and
Ms Gorman told me that Steve would have been pleased
that something more comes of his death and his inquest.
But that is the sort of verdict which is not only
helpful but right and what we do in our written
submissions is we invite you to be involved, in liaison
with the chief coroner, to encourage the chief coroner
to draw up some guidance, to allow the chief coroner to
recommend that, when your report is produced, coroners
can refer to it and to facilitate the production of,
where appropriate, narrative verdicts like this, which
properly, truly and honestly, and helpfully, record what                
    141happened.
So that is all we say on coroners for now.  In terms
of recommendations, coming close to conclusion, if
I may, we have expressed our Core Participants' feelings
on recommendations and compensation using, again, three
words and we invite you to use language like it, if not
the same language, in your report.  What they seek is
closure, reassurance and financial security.
Closure will come from a combination of, we hope,
the findings of this Inquiry and the recommendations
made.  Reassurance is likely to come from the
recommendations made in respect of future treatment and
care, and that things will change.  The financial
security is an aspect of the compensation, obviously,
but it is the combination of those three things as we
express it in our written submissions, which is what our
Core Participants seek.  It is to restore their dignity,
to preserve their health, and to provide the security
that was taken away.
One of our Core Participants, in giving his
evidence, said this to you: 
"This has been my whole life, even though I try not
to let it consume me, this has identified me and has
become me for as long as I can remember, even though
I have tried hard to live independently of it all.  It 
   142affects almost every facet and decision in life.  There
are no winners, no happy ending to this morally
impoverished situation.  What has happened cannot be
changed, the damage done to my community is
irreversible, there are depths of pain, you can scarcely
imagine until you actually get there.  It has often
taken my physical health and, more recently, it has
taken my emotional and mental fortitude.  It has left me
a shell of a human being at time.  I have often felt
broken.  I'm just tired."
We say sir, we invite you, and I know you will take
up the opportunity, to arrive at a combination of
recommendations of practical steps, of recommendations
in respect of apologies and memorials, recommendations
in respect of compensation, to do insofar as is possible
the right thing in respect of the individual -- the
cohort that he typifies, so far as possible to remedy
that situation.
Sir, I'm not going to dwell, in light of the time in
any real detail on many of our recommendations.  We
provided a number, all of which will reflect back to you
what our Core Participants have said to us.
You will have observed that at paragraph 799 of our
written submissions we identify some as being the more
crucial ones to our clients than others.  First, is 
   143an apology.
Now, sir, again, you heard what I said about
an apology earlier on.  We still don't know quite what's
been apologised for.  We are none the wiser, at the end
of the exchange of written submissions, at least.  We
may be a little wiser tomorrow, who knows, I hope we
will be.
But, we set out in some detail there the strength of
feeling amongst our Core Participants about what should
be included in an apology.  It is not simply saying
sorry, there must be some change of perspective.
An apology involves change of behaviour.  A reflection
that something has gone wrong and is to be changed.
So we look for an open apology in the House of
Commons by the Prime Minister and published alongside,
to evidence the genuineness of that apology, a long-term
commitment to remedy and make reparation to all of the
victims of this scandal, the government undertaking not
to seek the enforcement of any previous compromises or
settlements, as Sir Robert Francis has recommended that
what's in the past should be left there and people
should be allowed to step forwards, free of it.
A Government commitment, accompanying that apology, to
create and fund a body comprised of a representative
cross-section of Core Participants and groups to 
   144consider annually and review the process of
identification of infected and affected persons, their
treatment, welfare, their care, their eligibility.  If
you like, a commitment that an apology means doing
something seriously different in the future, that steps
should be put in place.
We deal at greater length with the apology in
writing.
Memorials.  You heard Mr Cummins talk about the
stained glass window at Treloar's.  That isn't right and
it isn't enough.  So, again, we describe the
significance that would be attached to memorials not
simply to be a point of reflection or contemplation or
remembrance or grieving, but a memorial also will stand
as a reminder or a warning to us all of what can happen
when things go wrong.  So, in a sense, it is not simply
to be a looking backwards and grieving moment, it is to
be a salutary reminder to take care for the future,
something that can be achieved by a memorial in a public
place and the significance that goes with the erection
of that memorial.
We also invite you to make recommendations in
respect of improved patient treatment, consent, record
keeping, tax and practical implications, coroners, we
have talked about, and then, having reflected on the                
    145written submissions put in by others, we are very happy
to endorse others' recommendation that there be a task
force of some sort to ensure that such recommendations
as you do make are properly and thoroughly and
completely implemented.  So those, in brief, are the
recommendations we seek.  There are others, of course,
in writing.
In terms of compensation, may I spend a moment or
two on this.  I think I still have 10 minutes left.  We
come back to the themes, if we may, of closure,
reassurance and financial security and this is the
financial security aspect.  What we suggest is that
there is a world of difference, as the Inquiry knows and
has heard, between the systems which have pertained to
date, which have been no more than support, and the
language of compensation, which even in its language
recognises that something has gone wrong.
We know and, sir, you know that High Court judges
regularly recognise in their judgments in claims in tort
for catastrophic personal injuries the possibility of
turning back the clock or of undoing all of the effects
of a tort, negligence or a wrong, and judges, as indeed
you when sitting as a judge would have done, recognise
that a financial award of damages in a civil court can
never truly compensate an individual for their suffering 
   146of a life-changing injury.
But, we suggest that this Inquiry is in the
fortunate and better position than the average High
Court judge in that it can improve on the remedies and
interaction amongst the remedies that would otherwise
not be available to a judge.
By giving closure through your conclusions, by
giving nonfinancial remedies and compensation, we use
not quite religious but close to religious language and
suggest you can achieve, you could achieve, this Inquiry
should achieve something closer to the concepts of
reparation, or restoration, or restitution, not in
a legal sense, and perhaps even using the language of
the Reverend David Armstrong in the Haemophilia
Remembrance Service, redemption.
You will remember, sir, the evocative language used
by Professor Sir Jonathan Van-Tam who referred to his
hope that people would be able to create a new future.
It is all evocative language but with our -- the
submission we make is this Inquiry can come as close as
possible to achieving that for those who have been we
say so badly wronged.
Coming to some of the detail of the compensation
arrangements, we in the very broadest of terms, support
the framework devised by Sir Robert Francis.  He was 
   147instructed by the Government as an independent reviewer.
He has, sir, as you know, immense experience of medical
legal work, in conducting inquiries himself.  He is
utterly impartial.  We observe today that there is no
obvious good reason for, if you recommend it, the
Government not to follow a recommendation made by you
and by their own independent reviewer.
As I say, in the broadest terms, we agree with the
recommendations he makes.  We make it clear, as one of
our Core Participants pointed out to us that we hadn't
in writing, that we include, as he did, naturally
clearers within the compensation scheme for an award
that is appropriate for the wrong that they have had
done to them, recognising that it will inevitably be of
a shorter scale and of a lesser magnitude than others.
We recognise that Sir Robert's proposed framework
has many points of reference to how courts work in civil
claims, to how personal injury damages or fatal accident
damages or clinical negligence damages are assessed.  We
recognised that what he suggests and we endorse is
rather like what those of us with long memories will
recall how the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board
initially operated when it was set up.
We recognise though that the tension, and we know,
sir, that you recognise the tension between something 
   148which can be operated still fairly but swiftly, as
quickly as possible, as efficiently as possible, as
against, at the other end of the spectrum, a long drawn
out complicated unsatisfactory adversarial process.
We don't recommend anything at either of that
spectrum but we do recommend something on that scale
closer to the legal process, for the very reasons that
Sir Robert himself recognised, which are that to have
the confidence of those who will be receiving
compensation through the scheme, they should be
reassured and recognised that it reflects what society
as a whole considers to be reasonable and that is
reflected in the way the courts themselves assess
damages.
I see with some trepidation, sir, that you have
removed your mask, which suggests a question is coming.

--Result #822--
   Aspects of the Irish system might take too
long.  Our concern though, or the concern that has been
expressed to us by the majority of our Core
Participants, and, sir, you will appreciate that amongst
a cohort as large as ours we have a huge range of views
on how compensation schemes should operate, to an                
    149extent, I am trying not to impress my own views on top
of my clients' views, my Core Participants' views, to
express them to you.  
The question of whether a system takes too long is
a matter of two factors, is it not?  One is how
complicated the system itself is to take any case
through it and the other is how many cases come crashing
into it all at once, how many drivers arrive at the
traffic lights all at the same time?
What Sir Robert has tried to do as we read his
report and what we encourage you to do, and what you
have already done in part through the first stage of
interim payments, is to, so far as possible, seek to
satisfy as many of the potential claims as might be
possible in a quick and expedient way.  What we hold
back from encouraging you to do is to say the whole
system should be so simple that it becomes so removed
from the measure of damages that a court would award.
The system by which it is awarded could change but
different in measure, we say, would be wrong and would
feel wrong and wouldn't give the Core Participants who
are going through it the same reassurance that
Sir Robert intends them to have.

--Result #823--
   Yes, we would.  We would.  He, of course, has
identified -- we make a number of technical submissions
which, sir, I know you will have read and I have no
doubt you will have understood but which are probably
not appropriate to be explored in technical detail here
today about, for instance, the damages figure as we
might call it.  The award figure and what correlation
that bears to an award of general damages in Common Law,
the function and the purpose of an award of general
damages in Common Law and, sir, I probably bored you 
   151slightly with page 242 and a number of observations
about the retail prices index and how things rachet up
from the figures which Sir Robert used to derive his
figures for the range of his proposed impact awards.
Sir, just to dwell for a moment, because I do like
the technicalities of these kinds of things -- to dwell
on that for a moment.  RPI, of course, is released by
the Office of National Statistics every month, there's
a further release due tomorrow, in fact.
Paragraph 874 of our submissions, page 242
identified that, at the date at which we wrote it, never
mind the Simmons v Castle uplift, which is a matter for
you to decide, and we've put down in writing what we say
about that and the reasons why we say that would be
appropriate to achieve parity, comparability with Common
Law damages, but never mind that, as at today's
calculation, rather than increasing Sir Robert's figures
by 19.3 per cent, retail index prices takes us to
a 19.9, virtually 20 per cent increase on the figures he
has there.  
So, sir, that you can get a sense of the comparison,
the top of the bracket -- and I bear in mind it is only
the bracket Sir Robert proposes while he suggests that
a panel might be better suited to assess the precise
figures -- the top of his bracket comes out as a shade 
   152over £377,000 as a damages award figure.
Sir, of course you will know that the most
catastrophic cases proceeding through the court of
utterly life transforming brain or spinal injury, in the
worst possible situation, today attract awards in the
region of about £470,000.  So somewhere on the scale
between a broken finger and the most catastrophic injury
one can imagine, we say it is absolutely right to put
these figures very much closer to the top end of that
scale and that's where Sir Robert's figures would fall
on the current evidence.
Sir, we make some other submissions as well about
the form of the award, which again are technical in
their nature, in relation to periodical payments, the
possibility for capitalising, as opposed to annualising
payments under a scheme like this but, to put it simply,
sir, it reflects a principle which you will have been
familiar with in practice and as a judge, which is that
while the development of periodical payments in Common
Law cases for clinical negligence and personal injury is
hugely helpful, in that it can provide a long-term and
guaranteed stream of income, it doesn't suit everyone.
Some people wish to be cut free from their tort
fees, some wish to be cut free from the annual
accountability, some people do wish to say "I want once                
    153and for all to have this settled and done and put behind
me, turn 180 degrees and march off in another direction,
metaphorically".  Allowing people the choice of one or
the other or a combination of those, we say, reflects
an individual's own preferences and reflects their
personal autonomy and that must be, we suggest, a clear
component of any compensation scheme.
Sir, I'm not sure there is very much more I can
assist you with in respect of the compensation scheme
itself.  Two further points though.  One is this, that
a number of our clients have made -- we haven't made in
writing -- a substantial number have made strong
representations that you should recommend further going
back and revisiting of equalling up or parity under the
various existing support schemes.  That is not to deal
with compensation at all, or rather not -- not to ignore
compensation but, as a quite separate aspect from
compensation, to go back and recommend further changes,
or levelling up or parity.  Once one starts down that
route, it is difficult to see where one can stop, save
that there is, perhaps, one step down that route which
might be recognised, which is that there are clearly,
as, sir, you know, categories of people who have been
excluded to date: parents of children, children of
parents who died. 
   154Sir, there may be, we urge you to consider whether
there is, scope to recommend that levelling up,
retrospectively, would be appropriate in respect of
those classes of people.  I say that in the broadest of
terms and I say it briefly because I don't want to
distract to the main submission which relates to
compensation.

--Result #824--
   We make no specific points about that ourselves
but are very happy to endorse the points made by others.
The only thing that then remains is to deal with
what I alluded to at the beginning of my submissions,
which is the potential that, of course, your report is
going to take some time to write, and rightly so, but
the potential that there may be yet further delay and
passage of time after that before any sort of
compensation scheme is implemented and before anyone can
apply and benefit from it.  So we have suggested, and
I'm happy to expand on or happy simply to mention and
leave two possibilities.
One is that adopting interim submissions on interim
payments, which, sir, I know you have and I won't repeat
here, we in that document proposed a logical rationale 
   155falling within Sir Robert's proposed framework, by which
interim payments of £100,000 could, we suggested, also
and should also have been made to estates and, in that
sense, would then benefit some of the groups currently
excluded from compensation or support.  Parents would be
able to supply in respect of the bereavement of the loss
of their child, children in respect of a parent.
Sir, that's the first argument that we put before
you.  We have already put it in writing.  I don't seek
to expand on it any further unless you ask me to.
The second is a more radical and slightly broader
point which is this, if it is going to take some and if,
sir, you share enormous discomfort with the attitudes so
far adopted by the Government or the lack of progress
towards or the lack of information about progress
towards a compensation scheme, and if, sir, you share
our real concern that, by acting in that way they have
evaded the scrutiny of all of the infected and affected
of your team of counsel to the Inquiry and indeed of
yourself, in respect of any scheme they propose, then
an alternative might be this: that in the course of
thinking about and considering your recommendations,
insofar as it is possible, you focus first on
compensation and that perhaps, as well as recommending
further interim payments, you make an interim report 
   156which is about a final compensation scheme.
So, insofar as you, sir, and we anticipate you
probably are, going to devise and flash out a scheme,
whether it is Sir Robert's Francis's or slightly
different, that, as early as possible, that is
published, so that while your Inquiry still technically
remains extant and there is, therefore, the possibility
of calling people back before the Inquiry, you can see
and can weigh up the response of Government to your
proposal in respect of compensation and can, if
necessary, apply the scrutiny that we would invite you
to apply to any schemes proposed.
We simply leave those both before you as options.
Sir, I'm not sure beyond that if there is anything
usefully I can say with respect of compensation.  Of
course, we remain very happy indeed to answer further
questions on it if you have those but, if not, sir,
I was going to do only two things in ending.
The first being to restate -- and I won't restate
because it is already on the transcript -- but remind
all who are listening here that we invited Ms Grey
tomorrow to answer six questions, to clarify six issues
for us.  That invitation remains open.  We will be
delighted if it is taken up.  If it can't be taken up
tomorrow, we might, in due course, invite you to find                
    157some other time in the next three weeks when the
invitation could be taken up.  But, sir, we are very
serious about our concerns that things should be
articulated and made clear in a process such as a public
Inquiry.
Sir, finally, we are going to end with a video clip.
We are going to end with a video clip of a little boy,
a little boy called Lee Turton, the son of Colin and
Denise who gave evidence before you.  I pause because
I don't wish it to be invidious that we picked one Core
Participant to particularly remind you of.  You know,
sir, and you have heard and you remember the heart
rending evidence of each and every infected person,
bereaved spouse, bereaved child, bereaved parent.  There
are many other examples we could have chosen, Susan
Hallwood, the Smiths in Cardiff, John Peach who
Mr Cummins mentioned who, for the first time, became
involved in anything to do with this Public Inquiry when
he gave evidence about his boys who died, having been
exposed at Treloar's.
We could also have focused on others who typify
aspects of this scandal which have not yet been
remedied, for whom no redress whatsoever has been
available, like Lauren Palmer who lost both of her
parents. 
   158But this particular family story, which you will
remember, so I do no more than summarise it, illustrates
so many aspects of what we have said in our submissions
today, Mr Cummins and I.  It represents the huge number
of children who were infected by this scandal.  He, Lee,
was one of the estimated 380 children who were given
HIV.
He, Lee, typifies the story of children being given
concentrates when they should not have been.  His
initial assessment was that he was no more than a mild
haemophiliac, 7 per cent, initially on cryoprecipitate
as a baby, his parents were then told it wasn't
available and they had to have concentrates from
March 1982 when he was ten months old.
He continued to be given concentrates through '83,
'84 and '85.  He was HIV negative in February '84,
positive by March '85.  That story resonates with so
many others that you have heard and so many other
witness statements you will have read.  But the family
story also illustrates the stigma for the family, press
intrusion about his school.  Despite asking the GP not
to tell the school, the school found out, the family had
to move to avoid stigma and abuse.
It also represents the fact that the child's life
has not yet been recognised for compensation, the 
   159parents who lost children who have been excluded from
support schemes.  Their story represents the long-term
effects on parents, as you heard them give their
evidence, and I won't repeat it now.  It reflects that
there have to date been no interim payments for those
parents.
Lee died at the age of 10.  He died 31 years ago,
almost to the day.  They have waited that long.  But for
the utterly unacceptable treatment he received, he would
have been a man of 41 today.
Sir, we recognise that there is an absolutely
essential job of legal analysis to be done, I hope we
have said what our Core Participants want.  I know that
others will focus on different parts of analysis but
this is not all about lawyers.  This is not at all about
lawyers.  The Inquiry is not about lawyers.  I cannot
think of a better way to give him and his family a voice
than to end with him not me.
This is what pharmaceutical companies, clinicians
and the Government have caused.  This family's ongoing
torment is as a result of Government delay, denial and
failure to take responsibility and this is what all the
words we have written and spoken like in real life.
(Video played)  

--Result #825--
   Sir, good morning.
By way of introduction, Lord Robert Winston,
professor, doctor, scientist, was entirely right to
describe the contaminated blood scandal as the worst
treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.
Disaster is a good word to connote the severity of
what happened but in certain usage it can connotesomething terrible but unavoidable, a natural disaster;
that is not what this was, we invite you to find.
This was a scandal, as we and others have long
described it, precisely because it was avoidable, it
need not have happened, and we will invite you to
conclude in your report that it should not have
happened.
Language is important and we expect a Prime Minister
to be careful with their words, and when she granted
this Inquiry in 2017 Theresa May described it as
an appalling tragedy which should simply never have
happened.  Jeremy Hunt, now Chancellor of the Exchequer,
agreed when he gave evidence to you on 27 July 2022.
Thousands of men, women and children have died or
have had the trajectory of their lives unavoidably
altered for the worse.  Families have been shattered.
This was a brutal, unacceptable, unforgivable and
unnecessary travesty visited upon patients in the
grossest breach of medical trust imaginable, with truly
devastating consequences.
A theme running through our submissions and those of
all the other Core Participants who have given you
written submissions for the infected and the affected is
individuals have been stripped of their dignity.  They
have been forced to lead lives they did not choose.  Ourtheme is that governments have, over the years, delayed,
denied and have degraded those who are infected and
affected by how they have subsequently been treated.
We will invite you to find in your report, as we
have done in writing, that all the concerns expressed by
our Core Participants and others, over decades, about
the blood products and the transfusions they were given
and the treatment they received and how they have
subsequently been dealt with will be fully borne out.
We analyse the totality of our submissions, we
reduce to one paragraph if we may in this way, we say
this preventible catastrophe arose from the combination
of pharmaceutical companies' greed and unsafe practices;
the skipping of known safety steps for blood products;
insufficient regulation, foresight and planning by
government; overenthusiasm on the part of clinicians
blinding them to the obvious risks and dangers of large
pool blood products; failure on the part of the
government and clinicians to recognise the long-standing
danger of non-A, non-B hepatitis, hepatitis C as it
became to be known, and their failure to respond
appropriately and quickly to HIV, HTLV-III as it was
initially called; and most significantly, failure to
apprise the patients, or, when they were children, their
parents, of the true state of affairs at the time or ownup quickly afterwards.
That, in a nutshell, is our summary.  Failing to
apprise the patients or their parents of the risks and
the options denied them the power to exercise their own
informed choice over treatment.  It turned them into
mere passive recipients of what others wrongly decided
was best for them.
Those affected and infected have battled for decades
to lay bare what we have now heard in the last
four years of evidence.  But we pause at the end of the
introduction to ask this: why, in the United Kingdom, in
the 21st century, did it have to come to this?  Why has
the truth had to be squeezed out of government by
campaigners through litigation and through public
Inquiry?
Here's an answer.  Jeremy Hunt, formerly Secretary
of State, now Chancellor of the Exchequer and, we
presume therefore, partly involved in decision-making
when you report, sir, had reflected on this before he
gave his evidence to you, and he said honestly in his
oral evidence to you, sir, "I am afraid that
institutions and the state close ranks around a lie
sometimes and I think that's what happened in this
case".
For those who weren't here to hear him, we should                
      5pause and let that sink in.  He thinks the institutions
of the state closed ranks around a lie.  And that is
a conclusion we invite you to draw in your final report.
Also at the outset, sir, if I may, a few words about
the word "liability".  I said a moment ago that language
matters, and indeed it does.  We recognise that in your
report you cannot determine civil or criminal liability
but we invite you in careful language to appropriately
emphasise what we describe as catastrophic failings,
woefully inadequate decision-making by government and,
in many cases, utterly unacceptable treatment of
patients.
We say there have been egregious failings of the
grossest kind on the part of pharmaceutical companies,
civil servants, ministers and clinicians.
You will recall and we note in passing here, we will
come back to it later if we have time, the unequivocal
view of Professor Savidge in his contemporaneous expert
report that the treatment of at least one of the boys,
of one of the witnesses who gave evidence to you,
Susan Hallwood at Alder Hey Hospital was, in his words,
negligent, negligent, negligent.
Without yourself determining negligence, you, sir,
have seen and can record in your report how others such
as Professor Savidge described it at the time.  Whileyou may be restricted by the Inquiries Act from yourself
reaching a conclusion of negligent, that is how we
describe it.
The Inquiry has heard the line peddled by
governments for decades that this was all done in
accordance with the standards of the time and that
patients got the best possible treatment.  That cannot
possibly be sustained after the evidence you have heard.
They did not.
So let's go back again to the Prime Minister
Theresa May in 2017 for a moment of clarity.  She said:
"Thousands of patients expected the world-class care
our NHS is famous for, but they were failed."
And we invite you to express those failings in the
strongest terms when you report.
Sir, after that introduction, let me pause for
a moment and step back before we dive in.  You know
that, with Mr Cummins and Dr Burin, instructed by
Collins, I represent more than a thousand of the
infected and affected Core Participants.  Our
Core Participants also include campaigning
organisations: Factor 8, Families and Friends of
Haemophilia Northern Ireland and The Fatherless
Generation.  And within those individuals are
a considerable number who have campaigned tirelessly fordecades as part of other groups such as Tainted Blood.
And we also represent the vast majority of the surviving
pupils and bereaved families of those who attended the
Lord Mayor Treloar school in Hampshire.
Now, some of those present, and perhaps more of
those watching online, whether the infected and affected
or members of the press, may not have watched every day
of the live stream.  We all know, here, that a public
inquiry is an unusual creature.  It is not litigation
between two competing parties in front of a judge
deciding between them.  You, sir, and your team of
counsel to the Inquiry, led by Ms Richards KC, have been
investigating -- and continue to investigate, as we
receive further documents from you even yesterday.  We,
by which I mean those Core Participants we represent,
have the role of being able to help, to assist, to offer
evidence, to invite you to look at particular issues.
You invited us to give you written submissions at
the conclusion of the oral evidence.  You asked us not
simply to regurgitate or recite back you to the evidence
you had heard.  You asked us to give you our Core
Participants' views on the issues which most concerned
them, both on what you should make as findings in your
report and what you should make as recommendations, and
we have tried to do that.Having seen the very substantial amounts of material
produced by all of the Core Participants, we can see you
have received submissions on all of the issues from
every perspective.  You have several thousand pages of
written submissions in total.  There may be differences
of emphasis and perhaps differences of some detail among
the recognised legal representatives who act for the
infected and affected, but I discern very little real
difference of substance among us.
I anticipate that each of those who represent the
infected and affected will bring a slightly different
perspective to what we say over the course of the next
three weeks.  For today we won't be repeating everything
we have said in writing, we know you have already read
it, but, like the approach of counsel to the Inquiry
when delivering presentations, we are fully aware this
is a public inquiry and a process by which what is said
is said in public, so we will touch on or allude to what
we wrote and we will spend a little bit more time on
some parts of it.  So we are trying to do what we did in
writing, only with even more focus, emphasising and
highlighting in this public forum what matters most to
our Core Participants.
So our intention today is to first of all summarise
very briefly what we've said in writing, emphasising key                
      9points, to dip in a little more detail into some areas.
We can't do them all but we are confident that you will
hear from other representatives over the next
three weeks on every area that concerns you.
Significantly though, today should be a chance to
respond to what the non-infected and affected Core
Participants have said in writing.  By that I mean
principally the Department of Health, as we call them.
Most of the time you will be hearing from me.  My
junior, Mr Cummins, is going to deal with the section
dealing with Lord Mayor Treloar school, probably after
the coffee break.
But before we begin, we do want to say, as we said
in writing -- to convey the thanks to you and to counsel
to the Inquiry publicly from our Core Participants.
Some have fought for more than 30 years for this
Inquiry, others for shorter times but no less
vigorously.  The analogy of David and Goliath, which of
course is the obvious one and is used in our
submissions, is entirely apt.  Long campaigning was
relentlessly pushed back against again and again and
again by governments -- and this is not a party
political point, by governments of all colours --
resisting an Inquiry until 2017.
Those campaigning have tried to piece together what 
    10some initially believed and, indeed, some who gave
evidence to you until very recently believed was simply
their own tragic experience.  That grew through
knowledge of others into an awareness of how widespread
this scandal was, with growing outrage, collaboration
and campaigning.  Even now though, attempts to get hold
of records, Freedom of Information Act requests, and so
on, are pushed back.
What you, sir, and your team have done and what my
Core Participants are enormously grateful for is
something like assembling a jigsaw.  The better analogy
perhaps is it is like assembling a jigsaw whose pieces
have been scattered through every room of the house.  So
you have our thanks for that: for what you have done,
for what you will do and, more significantly, for how
you have done it.
Let me tell you, if I may, briefly, what we are
going to focus on today.  I'm going to, in a moment,
focus on candour engagement from the Government and the
Government's response.  Then I'm going to spend
a moment, if I may, on the framework, we say, wraps
around the duty that rests on the Government and that
underpins its responsibility.
Then, I'm going to address you, time permitting --
or we are going to address you, time permitting -- on 
    11the topics which we have titled, in our written
submissions "People", that is the experience of the
infected and affected; "Myths and Lies", which is how we
have titled those assumptions, those unwritten
presuppositions that have grown up over time around this
scandal.  We are going to talk to you very briefly about
the Government and clinicians' response, about Treloar's
and, towards the end, we'll highlight aspects of what we
suggest you should find as recommendations and to do
with compensation, and then we will end, in time for
a further Core Participant to give his submissions this
afternoon.
Now, some parts we won't repeat in any detail today,
so, if you will forgive me, I am merely going to,
largely for the purpose of conveying them publicly,
emphasise some aspects of what we have said in writing
but won't delve deeply into.
First of all, the HIV Litigation.  We, the broad
point is, invite you to find the Government's approach
was wrong.
You can take comfort in so finding because of the
highly unusual intervention of the trial judge, Sir
Harry Ognall, into the litigation and the way in which
Lord Justice Ralph Gibson expressed his comments in the
Court of Appeal in September 1990.  Sir Harry Ognall 
    12said this:
"A Government which takes upon itself the role of a
public provider of medical advice and clinical services
is in a very different position to any commercial
organisation.  It is clearly arguable that their duty to
innocent citizens, who suffer injury under the aegis of
such treatment, has a moral dimension to it, which
should distinguish their assessment of their position
from the criteria to be adopted by defendants of
a corporate character.  Governments owe a duty wider
than to shareholders or insurers.  It should mean the
public may be entitled to expect from government
an appraisal of their position which is not confined
solely to legal principles to be found in the law of
negligence."
In the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Ralph Gibson
said this:
"It appears to be not in dispute that there was, in
fact, a failure to protect plaintiffs from the dangers
of using blood products, whether imported or supplied in
this country, which were infected."
Sir, the broad point, we say, is that those
plaintiffs, as they were then, claimants as they would
be now, should never have been made to litigate.  We are
not going to invite you and we don't invite you to go                
     13through the merits or demerits of the litigation; that
will be no part of your report I am sure.  But as
a matter of principle of approach and of the
government's attitude, we invite you to conclude that it
was wrong, inappropriate, as Mr Justice Ognall
indicated.
We note, a note in passing, sir, what now Sir Rupert
Jackson, then Rupert Jackson QC, said in his witness
statement before to you.  He said it is unfortunate that
the government of the day did not face up to its moral
responsibility in the same way the present Government
has, he said.  We wait with bated breath to see whether
that will be borne out.
Moving from the HIV litigation to self-sufficiency.
Again, in the briefest of summaries, as, sir, I hope you
understand, so we can then focus on other points in more
detail in due course.  What should self-sufficiency have
been?  We say it is very obvious from the evidence you
heard that, through the '70s and '80s, there was a drive
to provide as much factor concentrate as possible, in
part due to the business and the marketing efforts of
pharmaceutical companies, which stood to make
substantial profits from their sales.
In part, it was due to clinicians, whose enthusiasm
for being able to deliver what they believed were 
    14transformational products seemed to have blinded them to
the risks of those products.
In part, perhaps, it may indeed have been due to the
demands of patients who had been told that factor
products were miracles, without being told of the risks
associated with them.
Whatever the reason for which it occurred, it was
felt this perceived level of need -- which the Inquiry
knows was reported by UKHCDO clinicians to be rising,
year on year, from the late '70s, through the '80s -- it
was felt that was legitimate, desirable and unstoppable
and had to be met, whether by domestic production or
importing commercial products.  Our broad point on
self-sufficiency, which, sir, you will have seen
developed in writing, is that that is an example of the
tail wagging the dog.
We propose a counterfactual scenario in which the
clinicians and government ought to have appreciated that
all pooled factor concentrate carried a significantly
higher risk of harm through viral infection than single
donor cryoprecipitate.  They ought to have appreciated
that commercial products made in the United States
carried a very significantly higher risk of harm than
smaller pool UK factor concentrates, because of the
nature of the donors, the source of the donors, the pool 
    15sizes, these were all inherent features in the
commercialisation of blood and the sale and scale of the
manufacturing processes adopted in the US to maximise
yield and profit.
They ought -- "they", that is, the Government and
clinicians -- ought to have been aware that the viral
risks included what was then known as non-A, non-B
hepatitis -- we will come back and deal with this in
a little more detail later -- which should not even then
have been assumed to have been modest, mild, transient
or short-term.  No other hepatic virus was; why should
this one have been assumed to be?
Sir, we therefore say that the proper approach to
self-sufficiency ought to have been to have either not
used factor concentrates at all, unless and until such
time as the viral risks of non-A, non-B could be
eliminated, or, at worst, to have reserved concentrates
for the very most serious situations and most
exceptional cases of clinical need.  They should not
have been used daily, regularly, "thoughtlessly", is the
word we use.
When should that position have been appreciated, the
counterfactual scenario, and when, therefore, should
self-sufficiency on that basis have been achieved?  We,
sir, as you know, in writing take it right back to 1967 
    16when Dr Rosemary Biggs, respected doctor at Oxford,
wrote to the then Chief Medical Officer, Dr Godber in
August 1967.  She pointed out that the United Kingdom
had pioneered factor concentrate treatment, that there
was a shortage of it in England but her concern was that
US companies would shortly begin production.  Their
products would be expensive.  Everything should be done
to expedite the manufacture of these fractions in
England and in Scotland.
She considered that having pioneered the treatment,
the UK had the personnel who knew how to make it and had
enough plasma.  Although she expressed it in that letter
as a financial argument, her warnings about the
intrusion of United States companies must, to anyone
with clinical knowledge, such as the Chief Medical
Officer, have been understood to have included concerns
over the viral safety of the products, given what was
already known about the process of commercial blood
donation, collection and pooling in the States.  It is
possible, we say, that she framed her argument as
a financial one believing that was the language the
Government would best understand.
We say that was the first call to arms and the
self-sufficiency on the terms we have described it
should have been considered, thought about and                
     17implemented in or not very long after 1967.
We have urged on you in writing the retrospective
view of Dr Cash.  Sir, you will, I know, have seen that,
you will have remembered the article and you will have
recalled how it was addressed during Inquiry hearings.
He considered that there were a series of errors and
we urge you to consider them all in respect to
self-sufficiency.  But he described it this way: he said
the United States, US-imported products between 1972 and
1982 were "dirty blood, a sewer of viruses", and that
comes from a medical professional.
Moving from our summary of self-sufficiency to viral
inactivation.  Today is neither the time nor the place
to explore the details of our case on viral
inactivation.  We set that out in writing and we commend
that to you.
In respect of pharmaceutical companies, we summarise
again very briefly what we have said in writing in
chapter 11 of our written submissions.
The main impression that the Core Participants will
have taken from the evidence relating to pharma
companies during this Inquiry is, in fact, their failure
to participate, despite the fact that, we say, it must
be clear that they knew about the transmission of
hepatitis through blood products in the decades before 
    18the '70s.  They knew about the virtually universal
contamination of products with non-A, non-B hepatitis in
the '70s and '80s.  They were aware, as aware as
doctors, clinicians and regulatory bodies, of the
developing position with AIDS and the fact that it may
be transmitted by blood and blood products, and they
failed to give any or any adequate warnings in respect
of their products.  But we observe that those companies
have, we understand, watched but not actively
participated in any meaningful way in this Inquiry, and
we invite you to reach your own conclusions about what
we don't hesitate to describe as a cowardly stance.
Transfusion, sir, again ever so briefly.  We have
addressed that at chapter 12 of our written submissions.
We commend those to you.  The short sentence is this: as
one witness has told you, the safest transfusions is the
one not given.  The overall approach to transfusion, we
say, should have been to have considered the risks and
to have reduced blood use many decades before steps in
that direction were taken.
We have also set out some submissions in respect of
what you have heard described throughout this Inquiry as
"PUPs", previously untreated patients and, in respect of
other nonconsensual testing trials, studies and
experiments, again, sir, we commend to you chapter 14 of 
    19what we have written.  Today is not the moment to go in
detail through it but two points to pick out, really,
from it if I may.
First, is that, so often, you will have seen in
documents and even heard from witnesses language which
suggests that patients were commoditised for the
purposes of testing.
They were treated as a group.  They were treated as
a clinicians cohort, rather than as individuals.  They
were, in a sense almost traded with other clinicians
conducting trials to be offered for those clinicians'
trials.
We also flag up, as a second aspect of the testing,
Dr Craske's persistent and long studies.  Knowing what
he and other clinicians then knew or ought to have known
about non-A, non-B hepatitis, we say it is simply
unacceptable to have carried out long testing programmes
to see how individuals responded to hepatic risk.  The
simple point should have been they shouldn't have been
carried out at all.
Finally, in way of brief summary of what we say, I'm
not going to dwell at any greater length on consent,
communication and information sharing, which is how we
described chapter 15 of our written submissions to you.
We simply summarise it in this way: the evidence you 
    20have heard about the communication of adverse diagnoses
and, as well as that, that withholding of information on
diagnosis and risk demonstrates every variety of bad
practice.  The evidence you heard about how teenagers,
children, their families and spouses were told of fatal
diagnoses demonstrates an astonishing lack of care and
that diagnoses were communicated callously.
You have heard, sir, that they were communicated in
hospital corridors by nursing staff, they were
accidentally overheard, they were communicated months or
years after being known, they were discovered sometimes
by stickers on fridges or notes being left lying around.
We chose not, in writing, to summarise, and I won't
again orally, any further the evidence of the infected
and affected because, sir, I know you have that in mind
but we simply say this, we invite you to draw the
conclusion that the infected and affected suffered every
conceivable example of unethical practice about
communication or the absence of communication.
Sir, that's a summary of the things I'm not going to
dwell at any further length on, with an eye on the time
and hoping that we are heading in the right direction.
What I would like to do, if I may, is take you back to
the preliminary hearing, under the rubric of candour and
engagement from the Government.                
     21Sir, if we go back for a moment to September 2018
when you gave us the opportunity to make opening
statements at the preliminary hearing in Westminster
Hall.  We will suggest that what we then began to
outline to you, and others did too, has been entirely
borne out by your Inquiry and what evidence has been
unearthed over the last four years.
We suggested that complete trust placed by men,
women and children in their clinicians and in the State
has been broken, in that they were, without consent,
given products and blood, the risks of which were not
explained.  They were given no alternatives, no choices.
That, we say, has been borne out by the evidence you
heard.
We suggested to you then, even on the dearth of
evidence we had, that they had been subjected to
clinical tests and trials without proper consent or
proper knowledge and that again is borne out by the
evidence you have heard and we invite you to so find.
We suggested then that doctors were, at best,
mistaken and, at worst, took steps which were
substandard and unacceptable.  That also is borne out by
the evidence you have had heard, some of which evidence
shows catastrophic errors of judgement, ignorance of
accepted methods of treatment and even ignorance of 
    22material being disseminated by the UKHCDO.
We suggested to you then that the Government
response was disingenuous and inadequate and, again, we
submit that's borne out by the evidence that you have
heard.  You have seen, and we'll come back later this
morning to deal with, inconsistencies in the ways in
which civil servants dealt with information and their
communications with ministers.  
You've seen how assessments of clinical risk and
danger, most acutely in relation to the risks attendant
on HIV, were either unintentionally or intentionally
misexpressed so that an impression of far lower risk was
conveyed than was really warranted.  We suggested then
that politicians responsible for health took wrong
decisions in conjunction with their civil servants and
have since been covering up.  Again, we suggest that is
borne out by the evidence you have heard.
I chose to address you at the preliminary hearing on
what I then called the narrative of necessity and
I suggested you should look at it with real scepticism.
That is the account which has developed that factor
concentrates were a wonder product that simply had to be
developed and deployed, that they were life saving, that
haemophiliacs would have died without them.  Whereas, we
suggest then and we suggest now, that they are not truly 
    23needed at all, still less when compared with the risks
they carried.  We said then and we continue to say, and
I will develop later this morning, that the existing
treatment of cryoprecipitate was significantly safer.
Again, we suggested the shift from single blood
donors to buying commercial factor concentrates brought
with it entirely foreseeable and hugely increased risks
of viral transmission and infection, and that the
consequences of those viruses were appreciated in the
1970s and before.  We will come back again to that later
today.
Let's turn, if we may, to what I said at the
preliminary hearing about candour and engagement.
Lawrence, I wonder if we could have COLL0000025, please,
page 3.  Sir, you will recall we took you to the report
of the Right Reverend James Jones, the former Bishop of
Liverpool, into the experiences of the families who had
been involved in the Hillsborough disaster, and we
suggest that his conclusions are all the more resonant
today, having heard the evidence from the infected and
affected, which you have heard over the last four years.
May we look at page 7, please, where, sir, you will
see if we go to the third paragraph please.  He said
this -- and, sir, this touches, first of all, on candour
but, secondly, on how you yourself will in due course 
    24express your report and your conclusions:
"In this report I do not pretend to speak for the
families.  But I have listened to what they have said to
me.  I urge you [the Prime Minister and Home Secretary
to whom he is writing] to help ensure that those
responsible for our national institutions listen to what
the experiences of the Hillsborough families say about
how they should conduct themselves when faced by
families bereaved by public tragedy."
The situation is clearly analogous to that which we
are in today.  Could we turn over to the bottom of
page 8 and the penultimate paragraph:
"The Hillsborough families [he said] are not the
only ones who have suffered from [what he called] 'the
patronising disposition of unaccountable power'."
A term which resonates with the experience of the
Core Participants in your Inquiry.  He said there:
"The families know that there are others who have
found that when in all innocence and with a good
conscience they have asked questions of those in
authority on behalf of those they love the institution
has closed ranks, refused to disclose information, used
public money to defend its interests and acted in a way
that was both intimidating and oppressive."
Again, sir, we say that clearly resonates with the                
     25experience of our Core Participants here.
Could we please turn to page 13, internal page 7.
Sir, you will recall that in the opening in the
preliminary hearing I took you to this, which is what he
proposed as a charter for families bereaved through
public tragedy and we laid down the challenge to
Government bodies to comply with that in your Inquiry.
They said they would and we are entitled, therefore, to
scrutinise whether they have done and do.  You will see
there that he invites the public body to: 
"... commit to ... becoming an organisation which
strives to: 
"1.  In the event of a public tragedy ... support
the bereaved and to protect the vulnerable.
"2.  Place the public interest above [its] own
reputation.
"3.  Approach forms of public scrutiny -- including
public inquiries and inquests -- with candour, in
an open, honest, and transparent way ...
"6.  Recognise that we are accountable and open to
challenge.  We will ensure that processes are in place
to allow the public to hold us to account for the work
we do and for the way in which we do it."
So at the outset, sir, I'm going to look at the
Government's response, first at what they have done 
    26during this Inquiry and what the Government has said in
Parliament and elsewhere, and done or not done in
respect of the recommendations of Sir Robert Francis as
to a compensation framework; and, secondly, what they
have said in their submissions now.
I will deal with the first, more briefly perhaps,
than I intended.
How Government has acted so far.  We say that
candour is not simply giving up or surrendering
documents or providing witnesses.  We say that it is
being fair, open minded and treating the Core
Participants in this Inquiry with respect, and that that
has not been done.
Sir Robert Francis, sir, as you know, was required
by the Government to produce a wholly independent report
into a framework for compensation.  He felt it vital to
say the infected and affected should be involved in and
have confidence in that process and we say that is what
has been missing so far in the Government's interaction
with campaigners and with the infected and affected
during the latter course of this Inquiry.
I don't hesitate to describe the government's
approach in this respect as the combination of the two
words "patronising" and "condescending" that we have
used elsewhere in our written submissions.  Their 
    27approach has been to brush away concerns and to give no
detail, in effect saying: Don't worry, we're treating
this seriously, we'll do the right thing.
And they have said to a community of people to whom
the government had self-evidently not done the right
thing for decades, so it is something of a hollow
promise.
We have been told that the government can't say
anything about the shape or scope of the compensation
scheme which Sir Robert proposed, which you and counsel
to the Inquiry have scrutinised, which we as legal
representatives for the infected and affected have
scrutinised, on which we have spent days of time.  Yet
we are told that multiple departments of government have
been beavering away for months, but, strikingly, no sign
of involvement of the infected and affected and no clue
of what they have been working on, save again to say:
Don't worry, we are doing the right thing.
The question of recommendations and compensation is
a huge part of your work, of the work of this Inquiry.
Sir, we ask how difficult can it really be to see that
a public inquiry is precisely the forum in which the
government's past performance should be called into
question, and there should be all the more reason to be
open, frank, candid, helpful and proactive about those 
    28very significant issues of compensation, redress and
other recommendations.
We'd been promised the government would respond to
his report with a response.  That is, setting out the
government's view.  Before Sir Robert Francis gave
evidence, they didn't.  They haven't since.
In terms of timescale, sir, you know the government
got Sir Robert Francis' report in March of 2022, almost
a full year ago.  We were told by the then Paymaster
General that they would publish the government's
response alongside Sir Robert Francis' report.  That
then changed, in a letter to the all-party APPG, to the
government publishing its response in time for you, the
Infected Blood Inquiry and Core Participants, to
consider that government response before
Sir Robert Francis gave his evidence.  That didn't
happen.  Another broken promise.
The government only published his report
three months after they got it and four weeks before he
gave his evidence.  Again the Paymaster then, the
Paymaster General, said the government was considering
his recommendations and it was most important that the
government could reflect on his evidence and that of
others.  We pause for a moment and wonder: Who?
We are not told.                
     29Finally, after a Westminster Hall debate, we have
a statement in the House of Commons.  And I emphasise
this again only because it is such a key part of the
work of your Inquiry and is so concerning, as you will
appreciate, to the Core Participants, the infected and
affected.
The statement in the House of Commons was a formal
statement on 15 December 2022 from Jeremy Quin, current
Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General.
That, funnily enough, was the day before the deadline
for closing submissions to be lodged with you.  We say
colloquially the government has form for that.  It
announced parity in the vaguest of terms just before
Matt Hancock gave evidence to you, and it increased
payments, press release, just before the first day of
the victims' evidence in 2019.  Those, we say, are signs
of a government not willing to act proactively for the
benefit of the infected and affected.  What do we know
from December and the House of Commons?  We know
precious little actually, and I'm doing this to
foreshadow how little we can add to it from the
government's response to you in this Inquiry.
We know that the government for the first time
recognises a moral case for the payment of compensation.
We see that the government say they want to be prepared 
    30to act quickly when you report.  It tells us they have
committed to use the Sir Robert Francis study to prepare
for the outcome of the Langstaff Inquiry.  One asks
rhetorically: What does that mean?
Sir Robert's report is detailed but not complete.
It is a framework, it is not the finished article.  So
where, we ask, is the difficulty in saying in principle
whether it is accepted in full or in part or which bits
or which aspects or which heads of loss?  Or, even at
the basic level, Sir Robert's proposed uprating and
harmonisation of annual payments.  It is not clear still
whether the government proposes to include or would
commit to including parents who have lost children or
children who lost parents within the scheme.
We simply cannot explain why we are in the dark.
They have made interim payments but one asks again
rhetorically: Interim to what?  They haven't told us
what comes next.  The only impression we say can be
taken is they don't want their views on compensation,
most of which must surely be formed by now, to be
subject to scrutiny, question and analysis in as public
a forum as this Inquiry.  Is that good faith?  Is that
candour?  Come back to Bishop Jones, is that supporting
the bereaved, protecting the vulnerable, approaching
public scrutiny with candour or allowing the public to 
    31hold them to account?
Sir, we see a real risk that this Inquiry -- sir,
you have set yourself a mammoth task, we know that --
will necessarily take some time to report.  And your
conclusions may then not be swiftly or properly accepted
or implemented.  That will all take time.  But time, as
you know from the beginning of our written submissions,
is something that many of those most grievously injured
and affected simply do not have.
So at the very end of our written submissions and at
the end of today I am going to make two suggestions
about how to deal with that uncertainty which bedevils
the Core Participants, and with the delay likely to be
inherent -- likely, I say, from the way the government
have behaved so far.  We will suggest two things.
First, that you might take the approach of issuing
a further interim report recommending further interim
payments now.  Secondly, perhaps more dramatically, the
possibility of an early interim report in which you set
out a full -- your recommendation as to a full
compensation scheme, so that before the Inquiry closes
finally you will have set out your views on
an appropriate compensation and redress.  That could
then be responded to by the government before the
Inquiry finally wraps up.  And you would then preserve 
    32the ability to call before you the authors of the
government response so that we can then all publicly
scrutinise in the way that they promised we would at the
outset.
Let me move from that, if I may, to the government's
position in its written submissions to you.  That
discussion of candour and openness leads directly to
this topic.  First of all, we describe it as sitting on
the fence or, more colloquially, having their cake and
eating it.  Sitting on the fence is committing to
neither option.  Having your cake and eating it is
enjoying both.
The blood transfusion services have given you
a detailed response throughout parts of which they
accept they could have done this sooner or that later,
they could have done this in a different way, they may
not have done.  There has been a detailed analysis and
a presentation of their case.  That is what they say.
The UKHCDO have given you essentially a very long
chronology, although we say it is curiously sparing in
places.  There is simply one paragraph identifying the
critical Heathrow meeting and saying no more about it
than that.  And they offer you no help on conclusions.
But our most significant issue is the response of the
Department of Health and the government.                
     33With the greatest of respect for their advocates,
their submissions seem to seek to face two ways at once,
and it is, we say, wholly inconsistent with adopting
a position of neutrality or sympathy.  On the one hand
they say the current government has no case or
position -- that is page 15 of their submissions -- and
that it is entirely for you to make your mind up.  But
then they devote 600 pages to restating and seeking to
justify the position of government witnesses and the
politicians who gave evidence.
We pause to observe that, sir, you will recall,
almost all of the witnesses, for instance
Baroness Hooper springs to mind, say that they
themselves actually have no recollection at all of any
of this, and what they have done is simply been provided
with a lot of documents by the government legal
department and then produced a detailed statement
crafted from those records.
Sir, the distinction, we say, between the current
governments and previous governments is both artificial
and spurious.  It is and always has been the
government -- or the Department of Health, under
whatever name it traded -- throughout the years through
which you are concerned.  It has been a continuous
entity. 
    34We ask where is the self scrutiny or the reflection
or any sign that they have listened or taken account of
their evidence in their submissions?  There is none,
because they seek to steer between saying, on the one
hand, "We present no case", yet on the other dissecting
the evidence.
We, it's fair to say, expected something candid.  We
expected a position from the government.  Perhaps that
they knew this by then, or they should have realised
that by then, or perhaps done better in this respect, or
that they support their position in other respects by
other reasons.
Now, Ms Grey KC accepted at the preliminary hearing,
she said:
"... on behalf of my clients, I [say these] words,
the acceptance that this should not have happened, is an
acceptance that things went wrong.  Things happened that
should not have happened and so, on behalf of my
clients, I say, unreservedly, that we are sorry.  We are
sorry that this should be so, that this happened when it
should not have done."
What things?  What is the "it"?
You can search their submissions, as, sir, I know
you will have done, and we found no significant
concession or acceptance or identification of what went 
    35wrong.  What the things are that should not have
happened.  All we can see on the analysis we have done
is they accept that it was wrong to have lost
individuals' medical records and it was probably wrong
not to have held an Inquiry sooner, although it was
reasonable not to have done so in the circumstances.
That is, with respect, we say, hopeless.
We know that David Cameron apologised at
Prime Minister's Questions in March of 2015, after the
Penrose Report, using similar sorts of language.  He
said at the end of what he said:
"To each and every one of those people I would like
to say sorry on behalf of the Government for something
that should not have happened."
Reading these submissions, one wonders what he was
apologising for.  It is not as cheap -- it cannot
possibly be as cheap or as meaningless an apology as,
"I am sorry that you are upset".  It just can't be.
An apology is only an apology if it accepts that
something was indeed wrong or should not have happened
and that the person responsible for that wrong accepts
what they did and knows what they did.
So what, in these submissions, does the government
accept responsibility for?
We aren't told. 
    36The government's submissions attempt to hold the
utterly unsustainable line that they support and endorse
the Inquiry but at the same time have no case.  How can
that be?

--Result #826--
   Yes, but we are not told what the wrong is.  We
don't know the respects in which they accept things were
wrong.  Which makes it very difficult indeed for us to
address you today in respect of our case.  We have all
heard the evidence.  We are telling you the conclusions
we invite you to draw from it.  They don't.  They simply
say: We have no case and this is what the evidence said.
So, sir, I do it this way, if I may.  I express the
hope that we will hear from Ms Grey tomorrow in relation
to, for instance, compensation or recommendations.
Because we note that at paragraph 1.11 of her
submissions she accepts that those ministers she
represents, the current DHSC ministers, will be involved
in decision making on recommendations.  She is in
a position to comment.
So what we do is this, we invite Ms Grey tomorrow to
answer for us and for you and so that those who
represent the infected and affected, who will speak
after me over the next three weeks, know what the                
     37position is.
Question 1: What did David Cameron apologise for in
2015 and Ms Grey continued to apologise for on their
behalf in 2018?  May we have the detail?
2: What things do the government accept happened
that should not have happened?  Let's have the detail.
Let's see what is accepted.
3: What things does the government accept went
wrong?  Again, let's have that detail.
4: Can she confirm, as Matt Hancock said to you when
he gave evidence in his role as Secretary of State for
Health, that the government will implement whatever
recommendations for compensation the Inquiry makes?
As part of that, can she confirm whether
compensation will extend to parents who lost children,
children who lost parents, and carers, all categories of
people who have been excluded from the support scheme so
far?
5: And let's take a detailed example on which they
were silent, on what date does the DHSC accept that its
predecessor knew that non-A, non-B was a condition which
could have serious and long-term consequences?  Let's
know what they say.
And finally 6: When and on what date does the DHSC
accept that its predecessor knew that pooling plasma 
    38increased the risk of post-transfusion hepatitis?
Those will all have been things it would have been
enormously helpful to have known before today.  So we
could see where there's common ground.  So we can see
where there are issues and we can address them.
Sir, that's the challenge, with the greatest of
respect, for my learned friend, for Ms Grey, for
tomorrow.
What else do we say about the government response?
Well, sir, you have read the first 20 pages of it.
Apart from the recitation thereafter of what the
witnesses say, there are some areas which we can
identify as submissions and which you have asked us and
other Core Participants to respond to.  That's part of
the purpose of standing here on my feet speaking to you
today, is to respond to what each of us has put in
writing.  There are some areas where the government
actually advances a case and asks the Inquiry to take
a particular approach.  What do we say about them?
First of all, there is considerable reference to delay,
to the passage of years and the fading of memories, and
an urging upon you of caution.
Now, we pause to say for a moment that's hardly fair
because that's their fault.  If it is right to grant
an Inquiry in 2017, it would have been right in 2007. 
    39It would have been right ten years earlier, in 1997.
The suggestion that it is right now but was reasonable
not to have done before is not really understood by us.
It cannot be right -- and, sir, you know from your
long judicial experience that in Common Law it is not --
to allow a party responsible for a delay to profit from
it.  In other words, the government can't be allowed to
say that it should have the benefit of any doubt or
uncertainty in what is now old evidence, missing
documents and faded recollections when it itself caused
that delay.
We suggest that not only would that be abhorrent on
the facts of this Inquiry, it would also set the most
unfortunate precedent, because most public inquiries
consider whether the emanation of the state is at fault
for something; it cannot be right that the same state
which decides whether an inquiry should be held at all
should receive any evidential benefit from delaying the
holding of that inquiry.
Their submissions invite you to keep the events in
perspective.  The events of the day.  The standards of
the time.  Sir, we simply say in response to that that
we invite you to consider that that is no problem.  That
is what judges do all the time.  Part of my practice has
involved litigating over industrial disease cases, where 
    40one looks at the evidence, the standards, the procedures
of 30, 40, sometimes even more years before.  It is
a task that falls regularly to judges.  You are no
stranger to it and so we are confident you will do it
well.  So that is the short response to that
encouragement from the Department of Health.
Finally, they urge upon you by reference to a case
called Gestmin -- and now is not the time or the place,
again, for legal analysis of propositions of law -- but
I urge upon you to consider the passage of time on
recollection and accuracy.  In a sense, as I understand
their submission, it is to be more lenient on their
witnesses who had no particular recollection or told you
they had no recollection on certain issues.
Now, with the greatest of respect, again, we say the
analysis of that case is mistaken, in that it cannot be
elevated to some binding principle circumscribing how
you should approach the evidence.
Sir, there are more than I will mention but a number
of recent authorities providing a riposte to the
overplaying, as we say it is, of the Gestmin case.  Most
significantly it is a case called Solicitors Regulation
Authority v Day, 2018, where Lord Justice Davis says:
"Gestmin, helpful though it is in providing
guidance, does not demand rigid and unqualified                
     41acceptance by the court of the literal meaning of a word
in a contemporaneous document if the true analysis of
the circumstances in which it was used, including [where
it appears and so on] suggests that it was the wrong
word to use ..."
So there is no rigid principle that you must
approach evidence in a particular way.  Similarly,
Lord Justice Floyd in a case called Kogan v Martin:
"Gestmin is not to be taken as laying down any
general principle for the assessment of evidence.  It is
one of a line of distinguished judicial observations
that emphasise the fallibility of human memory and the
need to assess witness evidence in its proper place
alongside contemporaneous documentary evidence and
evidence upon which undoubted or probable reliance can
be placed.  Earlier statements of this kind are
discussed in Lord Bingham in his well-known essay The
Judge as Juror ..."
I will take it no further than that.
Sir, insofar as there is a submission to respond to,
this is our response to it.  You are not bound to do
anything other than the normal job of a judge, to see
things in their context, to assess all the evidence in
its proper surroundings.
Sir, that's all I intend to say about the 
    42government's response.  What I'm going to do is to move
very briefly, I hope -- let me check our timing -- very,
very briefly to consider the framework for a moral duty
or a duty on the government.
Sir, you have seen how we set this out in our
written submissions.  Former minister after former
minister gave evidence before you and there was
an acceptance that the government owed and had breached
a moral duty.  For instance Matt Hancock on 21 May 2021.
He referred to the errors that led to this harm on
people's lives but a sense that redress was not properly
considered.  Ms Richards asked:
"Do you consider -- and this is a question addressed
to you, Mr Hancock ..."
You will recall that Mr Vineall sat beside him.
"... that there is a moral responsibility on
Government to address the impact of what's happened to
those infected and affected?"
Mr Hancock:
"Yes, I do."
Now, we suggest, and other Core Participants suggest
more, that there is indeed a legal duty, but we know
that you won't find civil -- you are precluded from
finding civil or criminal liability, so we leave it
there for now, but in our written submissions we develop 
    43the framework for moral duty, looking at, first of all,
the constitution of the NHS.  We look at the World
Health Organization constitution and other things.
It may be helpful -- yes, if time permits, we will
look at the World Health Organization constitution,
which is COLL0000020.
Sir, I put it on screen now, I will take us only to
a couple of pages because it hasn't been touched upon by
the Inquiry before and, insofar as ministers accepted
responsibility, I think it is important for us to see
where that acceptance may stem from.
You will see, sir, this may be familiar to you,
I know it will be because you have read our submissions,
the World Health Organization came into being
immediately after the Second World War in 1946.
We see that the document I'm taking you to is the
records, the final minutes and acts, what was done at
the International Health Conference in New York in
July 1946.
Can we look at page 5, please, top left, please.
You will see, six lines down:
"The Conference, recognising the vital importance of
health as a factor in the promotion of 'conditions of
stability [remember this is just after the Second World
War] and wellbeing' for the nations of the world, 
    44included 'health' among the fields of co-operative
endeavour with which the United Nations system should
concern itself."
If we can then -- we will skip through some of the
rest but we will look, if we may, please, at page 100,
where we see in the top half of the page:
"Text of the Constitution of the World Health
Organization."
Sir, we commend this to you, insofar as you feel you
need to undertake an analysis of the duties or
responsibilities of a State, the State, our State, being
developed and being rolled out through clinical and
governmental services.
Sir, you will see there:
"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and
social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease
or infirmity."
This is the Constitution of the World Health
Organization to which, as a nation, we signed:
"The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of
health is one of the fundamental rights of every human
being without distinction of race, religion, political
belief, economic or social condition."
The final of those small indented paragraphs:
"Governments have a responsibility for the health of                
     45their peoples which can be fulfilled only by the
provision of adequate health and social measures."
Sir, that's our starting point: on the international
stage, there is a responsibility on the Government to
secure the complete physical, mental and social
wellbeing, not merely the absence of disease or
infirmity.
May we look, please, at COLL0000021.  Again, we see
the front page, just for the moment.  This is the NHS
Constitution for England.  Simply touching on and
developing, if I may, what we say in our written
submissions, there is a constitution.  It has been
revised periodically.  It will continue no doubt to be
revised periodically but, insofar as there is
a constitution, we say it represents and must represent
what always has been understood to be the role of the
NHS and its duties, in the broadest sense.
It also, this constitution, refers not only to
duties and rights but pledges, which it recognises go
above and beyond legal rights.  Sir, what I hope I'm
illustrating or laying out for your consideration is
a structure by which, as a nation, we have taken
responsibility for procuring these aspects of our
citizens' health and wellbeing and then, on a closer
level, within the NHS. 
    46If we look at page 3, please, we see at the top of
the page there:
"The NHS belongs to the people.
"It is there to improve our health and wellbeing,
supporting us to keep mentally and physically well, to
get better when we are ill and, when we cannot fully
recover, to stay as well as we can to the end of our
lives.  It works at the limits of science -- bringing
the highest levels of human knowledge and skill to save
lives and improve health.  It touches our lives at times
of basic human need, when care and compassion are what
matter most."
Sir, you will see -- I won't take you to the rest of
it -- but over the successive pages there are pledges
and expressions of rights.  We say, first of all, that
this represents, and has always at the material times
this Inquiry is concerned with, represented a pledge,
a commitment and an obligation of one sort or another,
whether truly legal or whether moral or both, on the
part of the Government and the NHS, to safeguard the
population in the broadest sense of that word.
We say, as you will have seen from other aspects of
the NHS Constitution, which I won't take time on at the
moment, if you fail you come clean: a duty of candour.
In that respect, I would like to take you, if I may, 
    47very briefly to three short documents in respect of
candour and engagement, when a government has breached
its basic duty of supporting our health and wellbeing.
Can we go to JEVA0000096, please.
This is a note, sir, you will see, from the bottom
of the page, 26 September 1985, written by someone in
the Department of Health, notes about a diary meeting.
Middle paragraph:
"My own feeling on this is that the Prime Minister
should [steer] clear of AIDS (!), even when it is
a question of opening laboratories to help innocent
victims.  I think this is ... something for Norman
Fowler.  If she is going to do a medical visit, I should
prefer to suggest opening a hospital, or a home for
children with incurable diseases, etc.  Furthermore,
I do not think we could entertain the idea of a visit to
Elstree shall (where the lab is) [and we all know what
they're talking about there] without existing it with
something else."
So, sir, what we have here is, at a stage at
which -- a critical stage after AIDS has become
apparent, we have a reluctance to be involved in
scrutiny or to engage openly or to be seen to be
associated with things which might be considered to have
gone wrong. 
    48Can we have, please, DHSC0003961_011.
This, sir, you will see is a letter of
2 November 1987, written from -- you will see the name
at the bottom -- John Major, then Chancellor, to Tony
Newton, Minister of State in the Department of Health
and Social Security.  You have seen this in the course
of the evidence that you have received in this Inquiry
but it relates to the suggestion that the Minister
should meet with campaigners from The Haemophilia
Society in 1987.  Sir, again, you will see there the
penultimate paragraph:
"I therefore suggest that you and John Moore should
listen only at this stage, and that the most you should
say is that you will consider the points made by the
Society, with no implication that the Government will
take action."
Sir, that's not engaging.  That is not accepting
responsibility.  That is not engaging with candour.
Finally, on this topic, may we look at COLL0000023,
please.  This is the then Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher herself, on 28 June 1990, writing to David
Watters of The Haemophilia Society, and this is perhaps
one of the first occasions on which a request for
an Inquiry was rebuffed:
"Thank you for your letter of 1 June asking for                
     49a special inquiry into the haemophiliac claim for
compensation."
Bottom paragraph on that first page, please:
"I am, therefore, not clear precisely what question
you envisage a special inquiry would be asked to
examine.  If an inquiry were to attempt to establish
whether there had been any negligence, either in general
or for particular categories of claimants, it would need
to sift through exactly the same kind of evidence as the
present legal action.  It is not clear that this would
either lead to a quicker outcome or one more generally
accepted as fair.  If, on the other hand, the inquiry
were to consider whether, in this special case,
compensation should be given without proof of negligence
that would open up some very broad and difficult issues
and could indeed require reopening the whole question of
no-fault compensation.  Again, it is not clear that this
would result in a quicker outcome than the court
action ...
"I am sorry if this is a disappointing reply."
Sir, we put those before you, that accumulation of
material, some of which you have seen before some of
which you haven't, to, we hope, make good our contention
for the underpinning of the duty that politicians have
accepted rests with them; the duty that they now have 
    50and accept to compensate; and the paucity of response to
it to date.
Sir, one final point and that simply is this, and it
is a legal point, so I mention it only briefly, as it is
not my intention to lecture today.  We say, in our
submissions, that not only is this a commonsense
approach, that if you are responsible for something and
it goes wrong, you say sorry quickly and you make
amends, but you are responsible for it.
We say it also chimes with judicial authority, for
instance, the position of rescuers at Common Law.  Sir,
you know what I mean and I don't need to deploy it any
further than that.  Put simply, you are liable if you
make someone else's predicament worse and we say that is
what the Government, through its Civil Service, through
the Department of Health, through the clinicians, have
done in this case: they have made the position, the
predicament of the haemophiliacs and others worse.
Sir, I'm not going to say more about that aspect.
Sir, I have an eye on the time, I have been learning
from watching Ms Richards how one stands here and what
one is supposed to do.  I'm about to start something
which I think will take more than five minutes.  Would
you like to break now?

--Result #827--
   Sir, yes, I'm going to pick up with where
I left off.
The next section we're going to deal with is one
which in our written submissions we used the curious
title of "Myths and Lies", and it was chapter 3 of our
written submissions, which, again, I know you have in
mind, sir, having read it.  Not everybody here will
have, and I'm going to explain what we mean by that in
this way.  
40 years or more have passed since some of the key
events this Inquiry is considering, and we and my Core
Participants believe that over that period of time,
either intentionally or unintentionally, certain
inaccurate and untrue points of view and assertions have
taken root and become entrenched as established
thinking, sometimes seemingly unchallenged as gospel
truth.  And those are the sorts of things that we refer
to as myths and lies in this section.
Sir, as you know, the Inquiry has already
scrutinised many of these, not only the truth with the
benefit of hindsight, but by assessing what was known at 
    62the time when these assertions were first made.
Our Core Participants asked us to identify a number
of these so that you could focus on them, deal with them
specifically and, again, if you forgive the vernacular,
call them out for what they are.
It is important to our Core Participants as part of
the function and purpose of this Inquiry that the record
is set straight on these issues unequivocally and
finally.
Again, sir, I approach this on the basis that you
invited us not simply to regurgitate evidence to you but
to focus on the conclusions we invite you to draw.  So
just to summarise or identify the sort of things I mean
as myths and lies, I will list them, and then we are
going to look at two of them in a little bit of detail,
and then in 16/17 minutes' time I will hand over to
Mr Cummins.
The sorts of things we are talking about, sir,
I know you will have read, are the often promulgated
story -- you heard it from Lord Kenneth Clarke -- all
this was just unavoidable.  We are very clearly inviting
you to conclude that that is simply untrue and
inaccurate.  It was not unavoidable.  It was not in line
with the best possible standards of the time.
Again, other examples of other myths and lies that 
    63have taken hold is that factor concentrates were
essential.  Again, sir, that is harking back slightly to
what I called the narrative of necessity in our opening.
We will come back to look at that in a little bit more
detail in terms of consideration of the respective
merits and demerits of cryoprecipitate as against factor
concentrates.
There are some substrata to that, that factor
concentrates were essential, one is the oft-repeated
story that haemophiliacs would die if not given
concentrates.  And you saw that played out in the
evidence of Lord Glenarthur, Lord Clarke and others,
whose understanding was any move away from concentrates
would be fatal for a very large number of haemophiliacs.
Another aspect of the cryoprecipitate story is that
it is often said that it wouldn't have been desirable to
go back to it.  Patients didn't want to go back to it.
You heard that from some clinicians, although whether
based on fact or based on supposition it's not clear and
wasn't clear in their evidence.  The suggestion that
cryoprecipitate was too old-fashioned, too cumbersome,
fraught with problems or that it simply couldn't be
done, that we wouldn't have had the processes to make
it.
So that is part of the cryoprecipitate bundle of 
    64myths and lies.
Others, though, are that patients themselves were
aware of and chose to run the risk of concentrates.  We
talked about that already, so that scarcely needs to be
said to be dismissed.
That there was "no conclusive proof" of the link
between blood, blood products and HIV infection.  Now,
that is a very big story which, as you know, you heard,
and it was examined in detail by counsel to the Inquiry
with Lord Clarke and others, as to how that line to
take, of no conclusive proof, was maintained for so long
and in such a misleading way.
Tying in partly with what I suggested was the first
lie or myth, that this was all unavoidable, is that
the -- another one is the risks of viruses in
concentrates weren't known.  Those two tie together and
I will deal with those together in a moment.  Another
oft-repeated one is that there would have been
insufficient blood donors to have done anything else.
We see that, and into an assertion at several
stages, that there were fear that we could not restrict
the groups of those who could donate when surrogate
screening was being considered for HCV and so on.
Lord Owen, his evidence to you was that, as far as
he was concerned, he believed sufficient voluntary                
     65donors would step up.  And there is, in fact, no -- we
say no cogent evidence at all to support the suggestion
that there would have been insufficient blood donors had
a different course been taken.
Other myths and lies: it has not been possible to
offer compensation because legal liability has not been
admitted.  Suggested that we couldn't do it because
legal liability had been admitted in the Republic of
Ireland.  But Mr O'Mahoney, in his evidence, told you
that was not so; a proper compensation scheme was set up
there despite the non-admission of legal liability at
the time.
Further myths and lies: haemophiliacs were fully
compensated by the combination of the settlement of the
HIV Litigation and the funding of the MFT.  We know that
simply not to be true.  A simple cursory look at the
figures, and your record of the evidence shows that.
Another, that no-fault compensation simply could not
be paid for fear of setting of precedent.  Again,
Lord Waldegrave, David Mellor and others expressed the
view that no-fault compensation could indeed have been
paid.  Lord Waldegrave explained that it might have been
in the government's interest that it was capable of
moving with the times, understanding concerns and making
an exception to a general rule. 
    66One more, before I come back to the detail of two of
them, is that throughout the last year, or two or three
or four, that the Inquiry has been going, the government
has been providing support for all the affected and
bereaved.  Sir, again, you know, but we invite you to
record specifically, that is simply not the case.
Parent who lost children, children who lost parents,
adult carers for their own parents, for example, are all
excluded from current support schemes or at least from
the majority of them.
I'm going to dip back, very briefly, into two of the
myths and lies.  The first is the combination of the lie
that this was all inevitable and that the risks and
viruses weren't known.  Now, again, sir, I'm very
mindful indeed of not regurgitating back you to the
evidence that you have heard.
Sir, others have tracked it through perhaps in
a little more detail than we did in our written
submissions, so it's simply to summarise the position
for those listening in this way.  We go right back to
1946 -- sir, as you will no doubt recall yourself -- the
British Medical Journal article linking serum hepatitis
and pool sizes.  Nothing has changed in the science
since 1946.  The science has always been that for
jaundice or hepatitis, the larger the pool the greater 
    67the hepatitis risk.  So the basis of any assertion that
there was no risk obvious or it was all unavoidable,
depends on using a product which is derived from large
pools.  If you don't do that, the risk is gone.  So
that's the foundation for that argument.
We then would take you through a series of steps,
all of which I am sure, sir, you will be familiar with,
so I simply say them so they are recorded on the
transcript as being the way in which we see the
knowledge of non-A, non-B developing and of its
seriousness.
The next step we would particularly refer you to
would be Rosemary Biggs' letter of August 1967, we've
mentioned it earlier, warning that the market would be
flooded with US commercial concentrates from more than
a million donors a year -- I don't think that is
an individual pool; I think that might be the totality
of the donors in the States -- and that if we in the UK
did not get our house in order we would be obliged to
buy it from the States.  It was extraordinarily
prescient in 1967.  It is, in fact, one of the
underlying keys to the scandal of what happened.
Next we would take you to -- and, again, sir, I am
sure you will have all the references; if not, we will
provide a short list of them in due course -- an 
    68April 1974 letter from Judith Pool at Stanford Medical
Centre in California, to the United States Government,
when they were considering relaxing their National Blood
Policy.  She described it as a new National Blood Policy
that in no way requires or even encourages volunteer
blood for this purpose but assumes the continuation of
what she described as "dangerous, expensive, wasteful
and unethical purchase of plasma by pharmaceutical
houses to provide this therapeutic material".
Even in 1974, clear references to the danger of
going down this route.  We then have, sir, as you well
know, the Prince paper in The Lancet, in August 1974,
identifying non-A, non-B.  Linking of significantly
greater incidents of non-A, non-B to blood from
commercial sources.
We have, in January 1975, again, from Stanford
University Medical Centre, Garrott Allen's letter of
6 January 1975.  Simply, if I may, to read out loud, so
that, again, we are in the public domain, he says this,
in the midst of his letter -- he is talking about
a particular product, Konyne, Factor IX product produced
by Cutter.  He says:
"As you know, Cutter's product Konyne, for Factor IX
deficiency, has proved extraordinarily hazardous, 50 to
90% rate of icteric hepatitis developing from it.  About                
     69half of these cases prove fatal.  Cutter's source of
blood is 100% from skid row derelicts [he says]."

--Result #828--
  Between 1976 and 1984 he was treated on
three occasions with Factor VIII concentrate, a product
developed to treat haemophilia.  At least one of the
Factor VIII treatments he was given was contaminated
with hepatitis C.  In 1994, he was diagnosed with
hepatitis C.  As a result of the infection with
hepatitis C he suffered a variety of mental and physical
symptoms which impacted on his university education, his
career, his marriage his ability to have children.
There was little or no support available and the stigma 
   140of the virus created isolation, frustration and sadness
at the loss of a life imagined.  He subsequently
developed cirrhosis, a recognised complication of
hepatitis C.  He was also diagnosed with cancer of the
liver and portal hypertension.  Both conditions are
complications of cirrhosis."
There is then a further description of the medical
treatment that was involved in the final days and hours.
If we scroll down to the very bottom of the screen as it
shows at the moment:
"Stephen Dymond's death is the direct consequence of
being given Factor VIII between 1976 and 1984 which was
contaminated with hepatitis C."
Again, I sought express permission to show this and
Ms Gorman told me that Steve would have been pleased
that something more comes of his death and his inquest.
But that is the sort of verdict which is not only
helpful but right and what we do in our written
submissions is we invite you to be involved, in liaison
with the chief coroner, to encourage the chief coroner
to draw up some guidance, to allow the chief coroner to
recommend that, when your report is produced, coroners
can refer to it and to facilitate the production of,
where appropriate, narrative verdicts like this, which
properly, truly and honestly, and helpfully, record what                
    141happened.
So that is all we say on coroners for now.  In terms
of recommendations, coming close to conclusion, if
I may, we have expressed our Core Participants' feelings
on recommendations and compensation using, again, three
words and we invite you to use language like it, if not
the same language, in your report.  What they seek is
closure, reassurance and financial security.
Closure will come from a combination of, we hope,
the findings of this Inquiry and the recommendations
made.  Reassurance is likely to come from the
recommendations made in respect of future treatment and
care, and that things will change.  The financial
security is an aspect of the compensation, obviously,
but it is the combination of those three things as we
express it in our written submissions, which is what our
Core Participants seek.  It is to restore their dignity,
to preserve their health, and to provide the security
that was taken away.
One of our Core Participants, in giving his
evidence, said this to you: 
"This has been my whole life, even though I try not
to let it consume me, this has identified me and has
become me for as long as I can remember, even though
I have tried hard to live independently of it all.  It 
   142affects almost every facet and decision in life.  There
are no winners, no happy ending to this morally
impoverished situation.  What has happened cannot be
changed, the damage done to my community is
irreversible, there are depths of pain, you can scarcely
imagine until you actually get there.  It has often
taken my physical health and, more recently, it has
taken my emotional and mental fortitude.  It has left me
a shell of a human being at time.  I have often felt
broken.  I'm just tired."
We say sir, we invite you, and I know you will take
up the opportunity, to arrive at a combination of
recommendations of practical steps, of recommendations
in respect of apologies and memorials, recommendations
in respect of compensation, to do insofar as is possible
the right thing in respect of the individual -- the
cohort that he typifies, so far as possible to remedy
that situation.
Sir, I'm not going to dwell, in light of the time in
any real detail on many of our recommendations.  We
provided a number, all of which will reflect back to you
what our Core Participants have said to us.
You will have observed that at paragraph 799 of our
written submissions we identify some as being the more
crucial ones to our clients than others.  First, is 
   143an apology.
Now, sir, again, you heard what I said about
an apology earlier on.  We still don't know quite what's
been apologised for.  We are none the wiser, at the end
of the exchange of written submissions, at least.  We
may be a little wiser tomorrow, who knows, I hope we
will be.
But, we set out in some detail there the strength of
feeling amongst our Core Participants about what should
be included in an apology.  It is not simply saying
sorry, there must be some change of perspective.
An apology involves change of behaviour.  A reflection
that something has gone wrong and is to be changed.
So we look for an open apology in the House of
Commons by the Prime Minister and published alongside,
to evidence the genuineness of that apology, a long-term
commitment to remedy and make reparation to all of the
victims of this scandal, the government undertaking not
to seek the enforcement of any previous compromises or
settlements, as Sir Robert Francis has recommended that
what's in the past should be left there and people
should be allowed to step forwards, free of it.
A Government commitment, accompanying that apology, to
create and fund a body comprised of a representative
cross-section of Core Participants and groups to 
   144consider annually and review the process of
identification of infected and affected persons, their
treatment, welfare, their care, their eligibility.  If
you like, a commitment that an apology means doing
something seriously different in the future, that steps
should be put in place.
We deal at greater length with the apology in
writing.
Memorials.  You heard Mr Cummins talk about the
stained glass window at Treloar's.  That isn't right and
it isn't enough.  So, again, we describe the
significance that would be attached to memorials not
simply to be a point of reflection or contemplation or
remembrance or grieving, but a memorial also will stand
as a reminder or a warning to us all of what can happen
when things go wrong.  So, in a sense, it is not simply
to be a looking backwards and grieving moment, it is to
be a salutary reminder to take care for the future,
something that can be achieved by a memorial in a public
place and the significance that goes with the erection
of that memorial.
We also invite you to make recommendations in
respect of improved patient treatment, consent, record
keeping, tax and practical implications, coroners, we
have talked about, and then, having reflected on the                
    145written submissions put in by others, we are very happy
to endorse others' recommendation that there be a task
force of some sort to ensure that such recommendations
as you do make are properly and thoroughly and
completely implemented.  So those, in brief, are the
recommendations we seek.  There are others, of course,
in writing.
In terms of compensation, may I spend a moment or
two on this.  I think I still have 10 minutes left.  We
come back to the themes, if we may, of closure,
reassurance and financial security and this is the
financial security aspect.  What we suggest is that
there is a world of difference, as the Inquiry knows and
has heard, between the systems which have pertained to
date, which have been no more than support, and the
language of compensation, which even in its language
recognises that something has gone wrong.
We know and, sir, you know that High Court judges
regularly recognise in their judgments in claims in tort
for catastrophic personal injuries the possibility of
turning back the clock or of undoing all of the effects
of a tort, negligence or a wrong, and judges, as indeed
you when sitting as a judge would have done, recognise
that a financial award of damages in a civil court can
never truly compensate an individual for their suffering 
   146of a life-changing injury.
But, we suggest that this Inquiry is in the
fortunate and better position than the average High
Court judge in that it can improve on the remedies and
interaction amongst the remedies that would otherwise
not be available to a judge.
By giving closure through your conclusions, by
giving nonfinancial remedies and compensation, we use
not quite religious but close to religious language and
suggest you can achieve, you could achieve, this Inquiry
should achieve something closer to the concepts of
reparation, or restoration, or restitution, not in
a legal sense, and perhaps even using the language of
the Reverend David Armstrong in the Haemophilia
Remembrance Service, redemption.
You will remember, sir, the evocative language used
by Professor Sir Jonathan Van-Tam who referred to his
hope that people would be able to create a new future.
It is all evocative language but with our -- the
submission we make is this Inquiry can come as close as
possible to achieving that for those who have been we
say so badly wronged.
Coming to some of the detail of the compensation
arrangements, we in the very broadest of terms, support
the framework devised by Sir Robert Francis.  He was 
   147instructed by the Government as an independent reviewer.
He has, sir, as you know, immense experience of medical
legal work, in conducting inquiries himself.  He is
utterly impartial.  We observe today that there is no
obvious good reason for, if you recommend it, the
Government not to follow a recommendation made by you
and by their own independent reviewer.
As I say, in the broadest terms, we agree with the
recommendations he makes.  We make it clear, as one of
our Core Participants pointed out to us that we hadn't
in writing, that we include, as he did, naturally
clearers within the compensation scheme for an award
that is appropriate for the wrong that they have had
done to them, recognising that it will inevitably be of
a shorter scale and of a lesser magnitude than others.
We recognise that Sir Robert's proposed framework
has many points of reference to how courts work in civil
claims, to how personal injury damages or fatal accident
damages or clinical negligence damages are assessed.  We
recognised that what he suggests and we endorse is
rather like what those of us with long memories will
recall how the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board
initially operated when it was set up.
We recognise though that the tension, and we know,
sir, that you recognise the tension between something 
   148which can be operated still fairly but swiftly, as
quickly as possible, as efficiently as possible, as
against, at the other end of the spectrum, a long drawn
out complicated unsatisfactory adversarial process.
We don't recommend anything at either of that
spectrum but we do recommend something on that scale
closer to the legal process, for the very reasons that
Sir Robert himself recognised, which are that to have
the confidence of those who will be receiving
compensation through the scheme, they should be
reassured and recognised that it reflects what society
as a whole considers to be reasonable and that is
reflected in the way the courts themselves assess
damages.
I see with some trepidation, sir, that you have
removed your mask, which suggests a question is coming.

--Result #829--
   Aspects of the Irish system might take too
long.  Our concern though, or the concern that has been
expressed to us by the majority of our Core
Participants, and, sir, you will appreciate that amongst
a cohort as large as ours we have a huge range of views
on how compensation schemes should operate, to an                
    149extent, I am trying not to impress my own views on top
of my clients' views, my Core Participants' views, to
express them to you.  
The question of whether a system takes too long is
a matter of two factors, is it not?  One is how
complicated the system itself is to take any case
through it and the other is how many cases come crashing
into it all at once, how many drivers arrive at the
traffic lights all at the same time?
What Sir Robert has tried to do as we read his
report and what we encourage you to do, and what you
have already done in part through the first stage of
interim payments, is to, so far as possible, seek to
satisfy as many of the potential claims as might be
possible in a quick and expedient way.  What we hold
back from encouraging you to do is to say the whole
system should be so simple that it becomes so removed
from the measure of damages that a court would award.
The system by which it is awarded could change but
different in measure, we say, would be wrong and would
feel wrong and wouldn't give the Core Participants who
are going through it the same reassurance that
Sir Robert intends them to have.

--Result #830--
   Yes, we would.  We would.  He, of course, has
identified -- we make a number of technical submissions
which, sir, I know you will have read and I have no
doubt you will have understood but which are probably
not appropriate to be explored in technical detail here
today about, for instance, the damages figure as we
might call it.  The award figure and what correlation
that bears to an award of general damages in Common Law,
the function and the purpose of an award of general
damages in Common Law and, sir, I probably bored you 
   151slightly with page 242 and a number of observations
about the retail prices index and how things rachet up
from the figures which Sir Robert used to derive his
figures for the range of his proposed impact awards.
Sir, just to dwell for a moment, because I do like
the technicalities of these kinds of things -- to dwell
on that for a moment.  RPI, of course, is released by
the Office of National Statistics every month, there's
a further release due tomorrow, in fact.
Paragraph 874 of our submissions, page 242
identified that, at the date at which we wrote it, never
mind the Simmons v Castle uplift, which is a matter for
you to decide, and we've put down in writing what we say
about that and the reasons why we say that would be
appropriate to achieve parity, comparability with Common
Law damages, but never mind that, as at today's
calculation, rather than increasing Sir Robert's figures
by 19.3 per cent, retail index prices takes us to
a 19.9, virtually 20 per cent increase on the figures he
has there.  
So, sir, that you can get a sense of the comparison,
the top of the bracket -- and I bear in mind it is only
the bracket Sir Robert proposes while he suggests that
a panel might be better suited to assess the precise
figures -- the top of his bracket comes out as a shade 
   152over £377,000 as a damages award figure.
Sir, of course you will know that the most
catastrophic cases proceeding through the court of
utterly life transforming brain or spinal injury, in the
worst possible situation, today attract awards in the
region of about £470,000.  So somewhere on the scale
between a broken finger and the most catastrophic injury
one can imagine, we say it is absolutely right to put
these figures very much closer to the top end of that
scale and that's where Sir Robert's figures would fall
on the current evidence.
Sir, we make some other submissions as well about
the form of the award, which again are technical in
their nature, in relation to periodical payments, the
possibility for capitalising, as opposed to annualising
payments under a scheme like this but, to put it simply,
sir, it reflects a principle which you will have been
familiar with in practice and as a judge, which is that
while the development of periodical payments in Common
Law cases for clinical negligence and personal injury is
hugely helpful, in that it can provide a long-term and
guaranteed stream of income, it doesn't suit everyone.
Some people wish to be cut free from their tort
fees, some wish to be cut free from the annual
accountability, some people do wish to say "I want once                
    153and for all to have this settled and done and put behind
me, turn 180 degrees and march off in another direction,
metaphorically".  Allowing people the choice of one or
the other or a combination of those, we say, reflects
an individual's own preferences and reflects their
personal autonomy and that must be, we suggest, a clear
component of any compensation scheme.
Sir, I'm not sure there is very much more I can
assist you with in respect of the compensation scheme
itself.  Two further points though.  One is this, that
a number of our clients have made -- we haven't made in
writing -- a substantial number have made strong
representations that you should recommend further going
back and revisiting of equalling up or parity under the
various existing support schemes.  That is not to deal
with compensation at all, or rather not -- not to ignore
compensation but, as a quite separate aspect from
compensation, to go back and recommend further changes,
or levelling up or parity.  Once one starts down that
route, it is difficult to see where one can stop, save
that there is, perhaps, one step down that route which
might be recognised, which is that there are clearly,
as, sir, you know, categories of people who have been
excluded to date: parents of children, children of
parents who died. 
   154Sir, there may be, we urge you to consider whether
there is, scope to recommend that levelling up,
retrospectively, would be appropriate in respect of
those classes of people.  I say that in the broadest of
terms and I say it briefly because I don't want to
distract to the main submission which relates to
compensation.

--Result #831--
   We make no specific points about that ourselves
but are very happy to endorse the points made by others.
The only thing that then remains is to deal with
what I alluded to at the beginning of my submissions,
which is the potential that, of course, your report is
going to take some time to write, and rightly so, but
the potential that there may be yet further delay and
passage of time after that before any sort of
compensation scheme is implemented and before anyone can
apply and benefit from it.  So we have suggested, and
I'm happy to expand on or happy simply to mention and
leave two possibilities.
One is that adopting interim submissions on interim
payments, which, sir, I know you have and I won't repeat
here, we in that document proposed a logical rationale 
   155falling within Sir Robert's proposed framework, by which
interim payments of £100,000 could, we suggested, also
and should also have been made to estates and, in that
sense, would then benefit some of the groups currently
excluded from compensation or support.  Parents would be
able to supply in respect of the bereavement of the loss
of their child, children in respect of a parent.
Sir, that's the first argument that we put before
you.  We have already put it in writing.  I don't seek
to expand on it any further unless you ask me to.
The second is a more radical and slightly broader
point which is this, if it is going to take some and if,
sir, you share enormous discomfort with the attitudes so
far adopted by the Government or the lack of progress
towards or the lack of information about progress
towards a compensation scheme, and if, sir, you share
our real concern that, by acting in that way they have
evaded the scrutiny of all of the infected and affected
of your team of counsel to the Inquiry and indeed of
yourself, in respect of any scheme they propose, then
an alternative might be this: that in the course of
thinking about and considering your recommendations,
insofar as it is possible, you focus first on
compensation and that perhaps, as well as recommending
further interim payments, you make an interim report 
   156which is about a final compensation scheme.
So, insofar as you, sir, and we anticipate you
probably are, going to devise and flash out a scheme,
whether it is Sir Robert's Francis's or slightly
different, that, as early as possible, that is
published, so that while your Inquiry still technically
remains extant and there is, therefore, the possibility
of calling people back before the Inquiry, you can see
and can weigh up the response of Government to your
proposal in respect of compensation and can, if
necessary, apply the scrutiny that we would invite you
to apply to any schemes proposed.
We simply leave those both before you as options.
Sir, I'm not sure beyond that if there is anything
usefully I can say with respect of compensation.  Of
course, we remain very happy indeed to answer further
questions on it if you have those but, if not, sir,
I was going to do only two things in ending.
The first being to restate -- and I won't restate
because it is already on the transcript -- but remind
all who are listening here that we invited Ms Grey
tomorrow to answer six questions, to clarify six issues
for us.  That invitation remains open.  We will be
delighted if it is taken up.  If it can't be taken up
tomorrow, we might, in due course, invite you to find                
    157some other time in the next three weeks when the
invitation could be taken up.  But, sir, we are very
serious about our concerns that things should be
articulated and made clear in a process such as a public
Inquiry.
Sir, finally, we are going to end with a video clip.
We are going to end with a video clip of a little boy,
a little boy called Lee Turton, the son of Colin and
Denise who gave evidence before you.  I pause because
I don't wish it to be invidious that we picked one Core
Participant to particularly remind you of.  You know,
sir, and you have heard and you remember the heart
rending evidence of each and every infected person,
bereaved spouse, bereaved child, bereaved parent.  There
are many other examples we could have chosen, Susan
Hallwood, the Smiths in Cardiff, John Peach who
Mr Cummins mentioned who, for the first time, became
involved in anything to do with this Public Inquiry when
he gave evidence about his boys who died, having been
exposed at Treloar's.
We could also have focused on others who typify
aspects of this scandal which have not yet been
remedied, for whom no redress whatsoever has been
available, like Lauren Palmer who lost both of her
parents. 
   158But this particular family story, which you will
remember, so I do no more than summarise it, illustrates
so many aspects of what we have said in our submissions
today, Mr Cummins and I.  It represents the huge number
of children who were infected by this scandal.  He, Lee,
was one of the estimated 380 children who were given
HIV.
He, Lee, typifies the story of children being given
concentrates when they should not have been.  His
initial assessment was that he was no more than a mild
haemophiliac, 7 per cent, initially on cryoprecipitate
as a baby, his parents were then told it wasn't
available and they had to have concentrates from
March 1982 when he was ten months old.
He continued to be given concentrates through '83,
'84 and '85.  He was HIV negative in February '84,
positive by March '85.  That story resonates with so
many others that you have heard and so many other
witness statements you will have read.  But the family
story also illustrates the stigma for the family, press
intrusion about his school.  Despite asking the GP not
to tell the school, the school found out, the family had
to move to avoid stigma and abuse.
It also represents the fact that the child's life
has not yet been recognised for compensation, the 
   159parents who lost children who have been excluded from
support schemes.  Their story represents the long-term
effects on parents, as you heard them give their
evidence, and I won't repeat it now.  It reflects that
there have to date been no interim payments for those
parents.
Lee died at the age of 10.  He died 31 years ago,
almost to the day.  They have waited that long.  But for
the utterly unacceptable treatment he received, he would
have been a man of 41 today.
Sir, we recognise that there is an absolutely
essential job of legal analysis to be done, I hope we
have said what our Core Participants want.  I know that
others will focus on different parts of analysis but
this is not all about lawyers.  This is not at all about
lawyers.  The Inquiry is not about lawyers.  I cannot
think of a better way to give him and his family a voice
than to end with him not me.
This is what pharmaceutical companies, clinicians
and the Government have caused.  This family's ongoing
torment is as a result of Government delay, denial and
failure to take responsibility and this is what all the
words we have written and spoken like in real life.

   Hello.  Can I begin?
So good afternoon everyone.  I my name is
Roanna Maharaj and I'm the Vice Chair of the United
Kingdom Thalassaemia Society.  Before I get into what
I'm going to address you today in our closing statement,
I'm going to tell you -- remind you about the UKTS.
So we are the only UK-wide charity for supporting
people with thalassaemia and officially registered in
the 1970s but active for much, much longer.  The Society
is very small, created by parents to support one another
because their children were dying quite young in life,
and now we have grown to a -- still small but we have 
    72grown to an establishment that advocates for better
treatment, patient rights, structured treatment regimes
and to try to help increase quality of life but also
life expectancy of our members.
Thalassaemia is an inherited blood condition that
lowers, alters or stops the production of haemoglobin.
There are several types of thalassaemia, depending on
the severity of the condition.  The most severe form is
thalassaemia major or transfusion-dependent
thalassaemia.  In transfusion-dependent thalassaemia
individuals aren't able to produce adult haemoglobin
required to live.  As a result of this, individuals
living with the condition can become profoundly anaemic
and require regular blood transfusions, ranging from
every two weeks to four weeks, from infancy, to survive.
There is no comparable treatment apart from the
curable option, which is bone marrow transplantation
that's not available to over 90 per cent of our
patients.
Individuals with the condition also receive
extensive iron chelation medication.  I can tell you,
being a patient myself, how difficult it is to undergo
this treatment, and without it you develop organ
failures and you prematurely die if you don't treat it
well.                
     73Infection is also something that contributes to the
shortened life expectancy and premature death and, if
that wasn't enough, talking about what we are here to
talk about, patients who receive contaminated blood
products also have to contest with the increased risk of
needing hepatic liver transplantation or they develop
liver cancers.
Throughout the hearing we were aware of the small
numbers of our community testifying and, despite the
best efforts of our team, who also reached out to health
professionals who our patients trusted, we also touched
base with other organisations who were representing
their patients to try to gain their insight of how they
were able to talk to their patients, we really did find
it -- we struggled to be able to encourage our members
to do so.
One of the things that people spoke about was to
re-live the trauma of their diagnosis and rigorous and
horrific treatments with interferon and repeated cycles
over and over, it was just too much for them to bear.
With that being said, in most of our communities in
which thalassaemia is prevalent there is still
an enormous amount of social stigma associated with
living with a blood condition and within some
communities the idea of someone living with thalassaemia 
    74was inaccurately categorised as someone being a burden
or less than and, you know, this one gets me the most,
they are not "marriage material".
So many of our families felt the only way to protect
their loved ones was by not disclosing thalassaemia, so
that they were not stigmatised further.  Now, the
feelings attributed to the psychosocial burden of
thalassaemia were then further reinforced by the stigma
associated with acquiring hepatitis C and, despite
affected individuals acquiring this through their
life-saving blood transfusions, that they didn't have
any choice, they were worried about the negative
attitudes that the general population would have and the
idea of when you think about hepatitis C of being -- and
how it is acquired, they didn't want to be stigmatised
further.
I say this because, even disclosing it to us, they
felt like they would be judged and that there were
whatever negative connotations that would apply to that
and they were afraid that -- I say "us" as a Society.
We are quite a new team but in case somebody spoke about
it, and we do have this in our thalassaemia community,
with even people in the NHS disclosing people's
sexuality to the community members, there is a real
fright. 
    75Now, the combined range of factors, including
illness related uncertainty, due to the hepatitis C
diagnosis, prognostic unpredictability, the feeling of
shame, stigma and discrimination, as well as the
previously unknown fear of transmission to loved ones,
all cause that kind of extra additional stigmatisation
and add to the burden of their entire health situation.
Another factor that we heard about quite often from
some of our patients who did want to testify is that
they felt by doing so they were letting down the
healthcare professionals who treated them and took care
of them for their life span, and they were enormously
grateful to their healthcare professionals because
without them they saw that they would not have lived,
and in thalassaemia, and I know in other conditions, we
have some amazing healthcare professionals who -- they
do everything in their power to ensure that we have
a better chance at life and to live.
But I think that was one of the biggest things for
them, that they felt they were being disloyal and
perhaps that they would be judged or perhaps that they
would be treated differently as a result of this.
But going through this, and we listened to some of
the hearings throughout, and trying to decipher about
what people -- so what, you know, like, some of the 
    76institutions were saying.  In our opinion we thought
what happened in the tragedy was inexcusable, it was
reckless, it was heartbreaking and one of the real
tragedies of our lifetime.
And as a community we found it extremely difficult
to listen to some of the testimonies and explanations
given by several individuals, you know, medical
professionals, government and the health agencies.  And
a lot of the time some of these individuals stated that
this event was an unfortunate tragedy and they were
sorry.  And I don't think it really offers any respect
to our community.  For one, it doesn't ease the
torturous battles our members faced or that they
currently face, nor does it bring back the loved ones
that were stolen from our community.
And, you know, being a patient, despite your level
of education, despite your experience, when you become
unwell or you are sick, you have this sense of
vulnerability, and I think your family members also have
that.  And during that time you look at the ones who are
more experienced, you look at your caregivers, you look
at the government, the health departments, and you think
that they are going to support you, they are going to
protect you and provide the best, safe treatment.  And
in this case that didn't happen.  And I think, in trying                
     77to cope with the realities in front of you, you tell
yourself and you reassure yourself that these agencies
that are required to observe and regulate, foresee, plan
and evaluate their services along are doing what they
are paid to do or doing what they promise -- or supposed
to do.  But in this case they didn't.  They dropped the
ball.  And due to their reckless behaviour, now our
communities are left to pay.  
And we still speak to parents of -- like, who lost
their children.  And you see that tragedy, you see their
children's experiences through their eyes, and they are
still not the same.  They still can't talk about it.
They still segregate themselves from the community.
They still stay away.  And I think that trauma, of not
just what the parents have faced but for the people that
are still living with this, saying "Sorry" and that
"This is unfortunate", will never help them.
We have submitted a list of recommendations as part
of our written statement but I'm going to kind of --
recount some of them, I'm not going to say all.
One of our recommendations that I still think, that
not just our patients but the community should have
access to the medical records.  In lots of instances
with thalassaemia, because liver iron overload gets --
you know, you can end up with liver fibrosis and 
    78cirrhosis and need a transplantation, it is very easy
for hepatitis C diagnosis to be pushed under the table
and focus on iron overload.  And that is what I think
really happened in our community in some way.
When people perhaps -- they died, what was
probably -- so we did do some investigations in it and
what was recorded in some of that is that they died as
a result of thalassaemia.  They died as a result of iron
overload.  But we don't really know the truth of whether
they died because having this infection exacerbated
their outcome.
So I think there is still a bit in the story that we
feel we don't know, and we did try our best to access
these documents and even went to the national
statistics, and it was sort of spinning a top in mud: we
didn't get anywhere.
There's lots of innovative therapies, and because
people have been affected by and have been infected with
hepatitis, they are not eligible for certain trials
because of their previous conditions acquired.
Now, I don't think that's fair, because this is not
something that they did to themselves.  This is not
a lifestyle choice.  This is what was given to them as
an unfortunate gift.  So I do think -- the equality side
of what our patients are being offered should be 
    79considered.
Guaranteed and timely access to liver specialists,
pain specialists, rheumatologist, dieticians,
nutritionists, physical therapists, these are all issues
that are affecting our community, but due to the
services they are not able to seek these treatment
options in a timely manner or at all.  Most of them
can't pay for it privately and they rely on the NHS.
We also thought that we wanted a guarantee that all
healthcare professionals, including medical doctors,
nursing teams, et cetera, receive mandatory training and
suitably incorporated into medical nursing and other
allied healthcare curriculums on thalassaemia, the
findings of the Inquiry, the risks associated with blood
transfusions, the importance of consent, ethical
training, communication skills, patient informed
decision-making and patient choice.  For us, that's
extremely important.
We would also ask for public funding for the UKTS
and other organisations to help us support our patients.
This is something that they have to live with and we
have to ensure it never happens to anybody else again.
A fair compensation package.  I don't think --
I don't know what will ever be fair but at least these
individuals living comfortably, being able to access 
    80services, is the least that can be given to them.  Also
I think that a recommendation should be given to the NHS
Blood and Transplant, I think more people -- and donors
for example -- I feel sometimes they don't understand
the risks that they bring to the recipient.  It is great
to donate blood.  I'm alive because of the blood I have
received throughout my life.  But I think when people
donate blood they don't understand really that, while
you are giving this great gift, we can't deal with any
more health conditions because it is really difficult to
deal with the one that we were born with.
So I think there needs to be more emphasis on the
communication to the general public, to donors, about
how important it is to protect the recipients and to
take that responsibility in filling out and answering
correctly, honestly on the questionnaires, disclosing
information.  I do think there needs to be more emphasis
on that and I don't think that the communication that
I have been seeing is sufficient, and it is a worry to
me every time I have a transfusion: am I going to be
protected?
In conclusion, in the course of the hearings, it has
become apparent that many mistakes were made and many
witnesses have acknowledged that they or the
organisation they represented failed in one way or the                
     81another.
As an organisation, as our organisation, I think for
us what was reinforced is that our voice, support,
advocacy and our need to call out the injustice in
whatever situation we are faced, is even more important.
I think being a patient organisation you are always
wondering whether you are going to step on somebody's
toes, whether you are going to be reprimanded for saying
things and I think there is a real fright for us to be
able to come out sometimes and say "I think this is
wrong" or "Can we ask for a second opinion?"  I think
this Inquiry has encouraged us to begin doing that to
a more significant degree.
At this point, UKTS would like to express our
profound gratitude to the Chair and to everyone involved
in the Inquiry, who tirelessly supported the hearings,
our members and to ensure that they were conducted as
effectively as possible, and I think this is the biggest
thing that we feel, is that we would like to pay our own
respects to the survivors and to the bereaved.
We have been inspired, we have been impressed with
the dignity of our members who did come forward and,
despite the distressing nature, they try their best to
continue living and to support the society to help
encourage our members and it is an admirable what they 
    82did in the face of this tragedy.
That's it from me.  Thank you.

--Result #833--
   Good afternoon, sir.  Good afternoon, everyone.
I would like to start by explaining for the benefit of
those whom I haven't met and who may not be familiar
with my role that I'm speaking today on behalf of the
Department of Health and Social Care, or the DHSC, its
predecessor bodies and the relevant bodies or
organisations which the Department was responsible for
over the years being considered by the Inquiry.
These bodies included the Medicines and Healthcare
Products Regulatory Agency, the MHRA; the National
Institute for Biological Standards and Control, or NIBS;
Public Health England, or PHE; and the Blood Products
Laboratory or the Bio Products Laboratory, BPL, for the
period that it was state owned.  Instructions in
relation to those bodies corporate now come from the
current body or organisation, such as the UKHSA, which
has replaced PHE.  These are the Core Participants
recognised by the Inquiry.
The legal team that I'm part of has supported the
individual witnesses who were employed by any of thosebodies, both ministers and civil servants, past and
present, throughout the Inquiry.
Former employees and ministers, ie the individual
witnesses, aren't Core Participants and haven't been
treated as such throughout the Inquiry.  So consistently
with this, my team and I don't speak, whether in the
written submissions or today, on behalf of the
individual witnesses who were supported by the DHSC
legal team when they gave evidence.
I would like to start, if I may, sir, by just making
a few observations on the evidence that was heard
throughout the course of this Inquiry and about the
importance of this Inquiry.
The Inquiry's review of over 50 years of National
Health Service history, of treating those who suffer
from illness or injury, requiring treatment with blood
products or blood or who have received blood
transfusions leading to infection has been important and
salutary.  In its work, the Inquiry has given a powerful
voice to the patients who were harmed by those
treatments and to their families and loved ones.
We have acknowledged, in our written submissions
filed on behalf of the Department of Health and Social
Care, that we, as the DHSC, cannot do justice to the
powerful accounts that the Inquiry has heard over thefour years and more in which it has gathered evidence.
We wish to start again by recognising this suffering
and loss.  We know that the evidence heard includes
harrowing accounts of the physical suffering and
psychological injuries suffered by those harmed by
infected blood or blood products.  The infected and
their families and carers and now the submissions filed
on behalf of the infected and affected or by some
directly have spoken of the challenges in securing
necessary treatment and counselling or other forms of
support.
Witnesses have spoken of the damage and sense of
betrayal caused by the loss of trust in clinicians, the
medical system and the NHS and the wider government
system that shapes and directs the NHS.
Many have told the Inquiry of their severe financial
hardship and of the loss of dignity and self respect
involved in making applications for support payments,
especially those which were means tested.  Campaigners
have told the Inquiry of the long and, until 2017,
fruitless campaign for a UK-wide public inquiry and
their frustration and distress when lengthy and detailed
arguments were met with standard responses that were
felt to repeat inaccurate or simplistic explanations or
did not answer the questions raised.The call for an Inquiry fell on deaf ears,
compounding distress in a way that has ultimately been
damaging for everyone concerned, whether first and
foremost the infected and affected whose questions went
unanswered, but also those who ultimately were called to
give evidence to the Inquiry many years after the events
in question.
Now, we are not trying to repeat the evidence of the
infected and the affected, which speaks for itself, but
the Department of Health and Social Care began its
written closing submissions by acknowledging the force
of that evidence and by stating clearly to those who
gave it that they have been listened to and heard, and
we wish to do so again.
Can I come then to the Department's position in this
Inquiry and today.  The Department -- the current
Department, which, as I explained, we represent,
together with the agencies that I listed at the
beginning of these comments, does not have and has not
had throughout this Inquiry a case to put or a set of
views to press on the Inquiry.  DHSC ministers and the
wider Government will, in due course, react to the
Inquiry's findings and recommendations but it has not
wished to pre-empt that process by offering opinions
now.                
      5Yesterday, the Inquiry heard submissions made by
Mr Snowden KC who, with his characteristic eloquence,
criticised that approach, contrasting it with, say, the
approach of the NHSBT.  It was submitted that the
Department should have set out in its submissions
a corporate case on what had gone wrong and that the
absence of such a case or evidence of learning
represented a lack of candour or good faith on the part
of the Department.
He suggested that I should today or perhaps, he
suggested in closing, within three weeks set out the
Department's response, in all but name a case, on
a number of issues where the detailed ones, such as the
date at which Government knew that the NANB, non-A,
non-B hepatitis, could have serious consequences or
a response to the more general challenge that he made,
"What does the Government accept happened that should
not have happened, let's have the detail?"
With the greatest of respect, there is not one model
of how to participate in or how to respond to an Inquiry
and, as a result, I'm not going to offer answers to the
six or so questions he challenged me to respond to.
The submissions that you heard, sir, yesterday
assume that it is a requirement on The Department of
Health and Social Care, ministers and officials, toassess the detailed evidence regarding more than 40 or
50 years of NHS and Government actions that the Inquiry
has heard over the course of four years or so and to
make its own assessment of it and then to present
a concluded case or position on this.  Even leaving
aside the complexity of such a process, it is worth
thinking about the implications of this demand, we would
suggest.  Such a stance would, no doubt, have involved
accepting some, perhaps many of the points that have
been made so forcefully on behalf of the infected and
affected about the history of those events.
We acknowledge that when that happened, that would
presumably have been welcome.  But, logically, it might
also have involved rejecting other points explaining
why.  We anticipate that that would have been a process
that would have stoked disappointment, distrust and
confrontation.  It seemed to the Department fairer to
wait for the Inquiry's conclusions than to rush into
forming our own.  Now, this Inquiry, sir, is not in
a position of having to rule on the cases or positions
of any Core Participant, including that of the
Department of Health.  It has the resources and the
expertise to chart its own path and to reach its own
conclusions.
We have tried to assist the Inquiry to draw on theinformation held by the Department, that is both
documents and people, as the Inquiry has requested.  But
we are not presenting a case based on the proposition
that we can add further insight to the evidence that the
Inquiry has already heard or by adding our own
conclusions to the ones that the Inquiry has heard from
witnesses.  The DHSC and the witnesses associated with
it have very actively engaged with this Inquiry.  The
DHSC does not seek to urge particular conclusions on the
Inquiry in its closing submissions. 
That does not reflect a lack of self reflection.  It
reflects the acceptance that it is uniquely your role to
make those findings.  Sir, we do not believe that there
is any requirement, whether in the Inquiry rules or
elsewhere, to undertake the process that Mr Snowden has
criticised the DHSC for failing to undertake, that is
for failing to set out, across the huge sweep of the
issues which this Inquiry has considered, the detailed
matters that DHSC accepts should not have happened or
the failings that it does accept.
In many contexts, it would be commonplace to set up
an expert body, such as this Inquiry, to resource it and
to support it to the best of our ability, and then to
await the results, without further engagement or
commentary on the conclusions that it's contended itshould reach.
Mr Snowden does not criticise, as I understand it,
the efforts made to engage with the Inquiry and to
support witnesses throughout the Inquiry.  The only real
difference is that we have filed closing submissions.
Now, we might, of course, have remained silent and filed
no submissions.  But we took the view that it might be
of assistance to the Inquiry if we try to draw together
the threads of the evidence given by, in particular,
those we have represented, this being the evidence that
we have the best knowledge of.
We hoped that the submissions might assist the
Inquiry by gathering together the threads of evidence
and the perspectives of those who were involved at the
time, especially when some of them could not be heard
directly as they were no longer available to give
evidence.
It was our view that the exercise should also be
attempted out of fairness to those involved at the time,
particularly those acting for the Department or
departmental bodies.
We also hoped that that exercise might assist the
Inquiry in reaching conclusions that reflected the state
of knowledge, as it were, at the relevant time.
However, what we tried to do was to be clear and                
      9explicit about the basis of our submissions.  We also,
as part of that process, aimed to set out key material
from those sources, that is predominantly from the
witnesses that we represented, as I have just explained,
fairly and evenhandedly.
We also tried to make suggestions about issues for
consideration by the Inquiry when we thought they were
raised by the evidence, rather than to suggest answers
or to draw conclusions.
For example, on the subject or in relation to
evenhandedness, we set out the evidence of Mr Burnham in
his witness statement of the resistance he encountered
to changing the line, when he said:
"During all of my time as Secretary of State, I got
the strong impression that the Department did not want
the position agreed by my predecessor to be in any way
revisited.  This much is evident in the advice not to
meet protestors and the preparation of 'strong defensive
lines' for meeting with the MPs but it was also clear in
my interactions with civil servants."
That was from his witness statements set out in our
submissions.
We set out the evidence of Mr Hunt, that it was
ultimately his position that an Inquiry should have been
established decades earlier.  The question thus was how, 
    10how it could have been established by the establishment
that nothing wrong was done and that the line was then
religiously stuck to by government after government, as
well as Mr Hunt's reflection that this was the kind of
groupthink that was in the government that said:
"This scandal happened because, you know, good
people were trying to do their best, something terrible
happened, it wasn't any one individual's fault and
therefore when it comes to compensation the matter is
closed."
Set out in our submissions.
We also reminded the Inquiry, and it is obvious I'm
taking a few examples, sir, but we reminded the Inquiry,
if that was needed, of the evidence of Dr Walford when
she expressed the concern that the recommendations made
by the UKHCDO in May 1983, on the subject of AIDS of
course, were weak because they were advisory rather than
mandatory.  She felt that a great deal of account would
have been taken of them by Haemophilia Centres but her
personal view was that the most problematic issue was
the position of those patients who were at times treated
outside of Haemophilia Centres.
We also noted her agreement that no one in the
Department applied their minds to a more nuanced
programme of risk mitigation that had been suggested by 
    11Dr Galbraith, such as restricting home treatment,
limiting surgery and keeping available NHS products for
life threatening surgery.  Those sets of steps being put
to her by CTI.
These are just a few examples of the careful
consideration that we tried to give to ensure that the
evidence summaries that we put in our closing
submissions were full and not partial.
Now, we have been criticised, sir, for a lack of
candour.  With respect, we would say that it is not
a failure of candour to say that the Department does not
have a case or a position to urge on the Inquiry when
that reflects its position.  It is not a failure of
candour to set that fact out openly in submissions that
are available to CPs and to the public and which will be
fact checked by the Inquiry.
Equally, we would respectfully submit that it is
proper to attempt a summary of the perspectives of those
involved at the time, again, I say, focusing on those
whom we represented, in their many aspects and
variations.
There was no shortage of perspectives in the
summaries that we drew together, and we were clear about
what we were attempting to do.  Quite some number in the
evidence of individual departmental witnesses were self 
    12critical or accepting that things could and perhaps
should have been done differently by the Department, and
that was reflected in the submissions that we made.
But we recognise, sir, and have recognised
throughout, that the task of putting those reflections
together with all the other evidence that you have heard
is yours as Chair of the Inquiry.
If there are errors in the evidence that we have
tried to summarise fairly they will be identified by the
Inquiry as well as, no doubt, by the oral submissions of
other Core Participants.  And of course, sir, we have
already alerted the deputy solicitor to the Inquiry of
any factual errors that we found to date and will make
sure that we participate in the process to do so, to
continue to do so, that counsel to the Inquiry has now
outlined to Core Participants.
We respectfully repeat, sir, that the submissions
were drafted with the object of assisting the Inquiry,
and bearing also in mind that the perspectives of some
of those involved can't be articulated directly.  It is
for the Inquiry to make up its own mind about whether we
have succeeded in our objective of assisting it.
Sir, if I could turn to the second limb of what was
said yesterday, the subject of financial compensation.
This was about good faith and the position of the                
     13Department related to financial support and compensation
for the infected and affected.
As everybody in this room will know, the Government
commissioned Sir Robert Francis to examine a possible
compensation framework in an attempt to ensure that it
had considered this issue, including the mechanisms for
the delivery of compensation before any report was
published, rather than waiting for a report as perhaps
it might have done.
Thereafter, linked to Sir Robert's work, the Chair's
interim recommendation, that interim payments should be
made to those registered with the existing financial
support schemes, was promptly accepted by Government.
The recommendation was made by you, sir, at the end of
July 2022 and on 16 August the Minister for the Cabinet
Office and Her Majesty's Paymaster General, Mr Michael
Ellis wrote to you, sir, agreeing that payments of
100,000 would be made across the United Kingdom to all
beneficiaries registered with the national support
schemes.
The payments will be tax free and disregarded for
benefits purposes.
Payments were made to eligible beneficiaries of the
United Kingdom Infected Blood Support Schemes and by the
end of October 2022 around £400 million had been paid 
    14out.  In relation to the issue of compensation, as the
Paymaster General and Minister for the Cabinet Office,
the Right Honourable Mr Jeremy Quin MP set out in
a statement to the House of Commons on 15 December: 
"Work is ongoing to consider the wide range of
factors set out in Sir Robert Francis' study.  A
cross-government working group, coordinated by the
Cabinet Office, is taking forward work strands informed
by Sir Robert's recommendation.  The work will ensure
that the Government is prepared to act swiftly in
response to your final recommendations related to
compensation and the Department of Health and Social
Care will play any part requested in this work but it is
being led by the Cabinet Office and coordinated across
government and the four nations."
Now, we recognise that amongst the submissions that
the Inquiry has received are criticisms of the fact that
the Government has not published a response to
Sir Robert's work or moved more swiftly.  The Cabinet
Office leads on this work.  The major response from
Government came in the acceptance of the recommendations
for interim payments and in carrying out the work that
was needed to implement that recommendation.
We understand that Sir Robert made his
recommendation in recognition of the fact that it would 
    15take time to consider and then to set up any system of
compensation, just as the Chair -- you, sir --
recognised that it will take time to complete this work.
The submissions the Inquiry has now had include
requests from members of the community of the infected
and affected for further consideration of elements of
Sir Robert's recommendations to be made by the Inquiry
to widen them.  This is not a simple process and the
work stream set up reflect this but the Government is
committed to the process that it has outlined.
The financial payments and commitments that have
been made to date are, we suggest, or represent,
tangible proof of the acceptance made publicly on
a number of occasions that the Government owes a moral
responsibility to those who are harmed through the
receipt of infected NHS blood and blood products,
prescribed or given to them by NHS doctors, nurses or
other clinicians, and which prove to be infected by AIDS
or hepatitis C.
Apologies have been given on several occasions over
the years and, most recently, on 15 December the
Minister for the Cabinet Office confirmed the
Government's acceptance again of Sir Robert's view that
there is a moral case for compensation to be made.
Before that, there was, of course, work done to 
    16deliver parity in the financial payments given across
the four nations in 2021, in response to observations
from the Inquiry on this issue.
Now, we had hoped that those efforts, together with
the further ongoing work, represented visible and
tangible evidence going beyond mere words of the
sincerity of those apologies and of the desire to do
what can be done to give some real and practical
assistance and redress to those who have suffered.
It may be that the submissions heard yesterday
suggest that these efforts, including the acceptance of
moral responsibility and the payment of interim
compensation, have done little to mitigate the damage
caused by suffering over the years.  But we can only
repeat that our client, the Department of Health, will
continue to work closely with the Cabinet Office, which,
as I say, leads on this work, not least because of that
history, in the weeks to come.
Sir, if I turn then to the topic of any further
submissions today.  I would say that we had originally
been minded to summarise what we regarded as the more
central evidence in our written submissions today as
a guide to those who hadn't wished to spend time on
them, for understandable reasons.
We had intended to draw the threads together of what                
     17had been said in our written submissions.  The primary
aim had been to highlight aspects of those written
submissions, rather than to comment on the contents of
written submissions made by other Core Participants,
although we did have a few comments on some observations
that had been made.
However, in the light of yesterday's submissions, we
don't propose to do that.  We don't wish to provoke
further suggestions that what we say represents a less
than genuine attempt to assist the Inquiry or to stir up
further comments to the effect that the Department is
putting its own point of view when the Government should
have listened more and read more, as we heard from some
of the observations in the written submissions from the
Core Participants.
We do hope that the written submissions that have
already been filed are genuinely helpful to the Inquiry,
which may make what use it sees fit of them.  Instead,
I'm going to make a few short remarks, if I may, about
recent disclosures and the process of the Inquiry over
the last few years.
I do regret any inconvenience caused by the delivery
of a substantially shorter address than originally
timetabled.  In relation to documents that have been
produced since the written submissions were filed, we 
    18note that counsel to the Inquiry have produced a very
helpful note on the topic of parliamentary privilege and
we welcome this.  We would respectfully suggest that the
Chair should provide a ruling on this topic, after
inviting submissions from interested parties which might
usefully include the parliamentary authorities.  The
point is of some constitutional significance and,
without a ruling, the position which the Inquiry has
reached on the law, will be clarified only once the
report is published.
I will turn then, if I may, just to make a few
concluding remarks because we would like to end by
recognising again the importance of this Inquiry's
careful work.  We wish to thank all of those who have
contributed to its work, not only the Inquiry's legal
team, but the Inquiry staff who have been utterly
essential to its smooth running and have given so much
help to all those who have entered this building.  This
includes support to all of those who have been following
the Inquiry's proceedings, as well as to the witnesses
and the legal teams.
In relation to those who have been following the
Inquiry, we would like to pay particular tribute to
those who have been listening to the evidence in this
hearing room, often day in day out.  The dignity of 
    19those who have been able to listen with such care and
attention, often to what must have been difficult,
sometimes distressing evidence, has been remarkable.  We
would wish to place on record our thanks for the
courtesy that has been shown to witnesses.  Everyone
present here, observing and listening, as well as the
Inquiry and staff, have enabled an atmosphere in which
witnesses were able to come to this Inquiry and be
questioned in a courteous but rigorous manner.
That this has happened is not only an achievement on
the part of the Inquiry team, which we acknowledge, but
also an achievement on the part of those listening to
the evidence and we would like to record our recognition
of this and our thanks.
We don't forget the invisible contribution of those
who watched remotely.  We are sure that they too are
feeding into the proceedings.  We are very glad that the
use of technology has enabled wider participation, not
least against the background of the Covid pandemic which
this Inquiry has successfully navigated with care and
thought, particularly with regard to the vulnerabilities
of some of those who have been attending.  Again, we
would like to acknowledge this.
We would also like to acknowledge the contribution
of the many witnesses who have given much time and 
    20thought to their evidence.  Of course, it is to be fully
expected that serving civil servants and ministers will
do this, however many of the departmental witnesses were
long since retired but diligently sought to assist the
Inquiry, notwithstanding the challenges presented by
age, infirmity or just the passage of time.
Now, I just mention the Departmental witnesses but
both they and the Department of Health itself would
immediately continue by saying that we are all conscious
above all of the contributions of the infected and
affected who gave evidence.  We recognise the strains
imposed on them, not only because of the result of the
challenges presented by age, infirmity or the passage of
time, as I have just mentioned, but because they were
also being asked to re-visit trauma and suffering.  All
of us who have sat and listened to their evidence will
have memories of dignity, courage and endurance and will
have heard evidence that was deeply moving.
I would like on behalf of the Department to
recognise their contribution, both to the Inquiry and to
the improvements in policy and practice that we fully
anticipate will follow the Inquiry.
In that spirit, the Department will now await the
Inquiry report and is committed to considering all of
its findings and recommendations with great care.                
     21Sir, that is all I wish to say.

--Result #834--
   Thank you.
It is self-evident that this Inquiry, when it ends,
should give participants a sense that they have had
justice and compensation for the losses and difficulties
they have endured since the 1980s.
For myself, I hope that when the report is published
it will give me a clearer overview of the way this
treatment disaster played out, with analysis of the role
of key players and decision makers and organisations.
I know, through lived experience, the impact on my
family and I have heard some truly harrowing 
    26descriptions of the impact of the viruses, their
treatment and the dreadful financial impact on some
individuals and families.
But what I don't have is an aerial view of how it
all happened and, obviously, it is incredibly complex.
But I want to know what did or didn't contribute to the
disaster.  I certainly don't believe it was bad luck.
I hope the report addresses the intransigent
stubbornness of politicians who have simply refused to
consider that they might have taken a more sympathetic
and compassionate view of the people caught up in this
disaster.  My impression in viewing the -- listening to
the Inquiry is that there was little real regret and
their overriding concern has always been for cost.  If
there was any admission of fault or liability they
feared an endless stream of supplicants seeking redress.
After all, why enrich people who are going to die?  It
is not as if we are going to offshore our money.
I hope the Inquiry has quite a lot to say about
this, but it stopped sympathetic response.
The hubris of some political contributors expose
their patronising view of the people affected as being
"other" and viewed as being "unfortunate" but of lesser
importance.  Of course, there have been some notable
exceptions.  There is a wider point which should be made 
    27in the report which applies to the suggestion that
others, as well as the infected blood community, are
denied justice for decades because it is simply too
inconvenient or expensive to take their views or
experiences seriously.
New arrangements for families bereaved through
public tragedy are long overdue.  The title of
Bishop James Jones' Hillsborough report, 'The
patronising disposition of unaccountable power',
encapsulates the experience of many of the infected
blood community as well as those involved in
Hillsborough, Grenfell, Windrush and probably many
others.  What is the purpose of government if one of its
functions is not to support and protect citizens in
times of crisis and difficulty?
I think there are good arguments for a no-fault
compensation scheme for the times when things go wrong,
particularly in health care.  Why do we have such
adversarial systems where health bodies do their best to
avoid saying that mistakes have been made?
Bishop Jones has already suggested a different
approach for those who find themselves bereaved by
events over which they have little or no control.  They
are stunned by tragedy and then have to battle for
an apology and some sort of award to allow them to 
    28continue to care and recover.  I am sure cost is at the
heart of this.  But in the long-term it surely costs
more and the loss of trust is never assessed.
Organisations can hardly expect clinicians or others
to practice in a reflective way if the culture of public
life -- if it doesn't exist.  I suppose things like
clinical governance and the Nolan Principles were steps
in the right direction but it seems to me it hasn't gone
far enough.
I'm still firmly of the belief that a publicly
funded health care system is the fairest and most
economical way of delivering health care.  However, it
is almost treated as a belief system where questioning
is treated as heresy.  This is in itself leads to
an erosion of confidence.  People are scared to
challenge and often do not have the language or
confidence to raise questions.  Better scrutiny,
challenge and greater use of user involvement surely
could make a difference.  And race and class remain one
of the unaddressed issues in health care.  The necessity
of scrutiny and challenge are especially important where
people have to manage conditions on a lifelong basis.
The sheer length of time we have waited for this
Inquiry and its recommendations is embarrassing and
mean spirited compared to other jurisdictions who have                
     29acted much more quickly to deal with the fallout from
infected blood.
The beginning of reparations have been made for some
people such as myself but it is not clear what the final
arrangements will be.  I very much hope that the
compensation arrangements will be sufficiently generous
and will not leave people feeling aggrieved or pit one
group against another.
Given the length of time it has taken to get to this
point, I hope it will be as unbureaucratic as possible.
Time is pretty critical as it has already run out for
some people.
Thank you.

you're looking here at documents 
that 
would have passed
your desk decades ago.  Do you recall what your thinking
was, or do you know what you think it would have been,
on the issues that were being set out here in terms of
repercussions and how you weighed those matters?

Then the fourth item, item D, appended to Mr Canavan's
minute of 6 November we will look at briefly.
It's DHSC0046962_187.
This is an update on the present position on the
HIV
 
Haemophilia Litigation
.  
Under the heading "Court
Proceedings
" -- 
I don't need to read through it but it's
a summary of the position relating to the proceedings.
There's then an account of the position regarding public
interest immunity which had pre
-
dated your time as
 
46
Secretary of State.
Then we see the heading "Parliamentary Activity":
"Over the past year there have been 
three
adjournment debates on the question of compensation for
haemophiliacs with HIV
.  
The Hansard 
account 
of the most
recent debated on 15
 
October is annexed
.  
In addition
,
the Haemophilia Society has organised a write-in
campaign to increase pressure for an out of court
settlement of the litigation.
"
It is possible that the Opposition will seek to
increase the pressure by initiating a Supply debate on
the matter shortly 
after 
the start of the new
Parliamentary Session."
Pausing there, is it right to understand that
the -- again
, 
as part of the context in which you were
operating, there was the campaign through the
Haemophilia Society and 
indeed
 through various
newspapers, but there was also intense Parliamentary
interest by this point in time on this issue?

--Result #837--

Or otherwise Harriet Harman.  A no-fault compensation
bill.
There's then a description of the intervention of
Mr Justice Ognall.  I'm not going to read through 
that
.
If we just go towards the bottom of the page, we
can see this brings matters really up to date prior to
the day before you took office
.  
It refers to
Kenneth Clarke meeting counsel on 1
 
November
:
"
The 
line 
was 
confirmed that 
there
 should be 
no
offer from the 
Department.  However, our Counsel would
make 
known to the Plaintiffs that if they were to 
offer
a settlement around £20 to £25 million plus 
cost
s this
might be considered."
Then there's a reference to 
no
 money having been
agreed with the 
Treasury
.
Then if we go to the next page
:
"
Counsel's Opinion on Legal Defence
"The latest opinion from Counsel 
given
 last week
is that the Government defendants should be able to
defeat the plaintiffs' claims.  However
 
they caution
ed
there are a number of areas of risk and therefore it
would be unwise to proceed on the assumption that all
 
48
the plaintiffs' claims will certainly fail."
You would presumably have understood from this
that although the advice that you were being given was
that it was likely the defendants would succeed in the
claim
, 
it was by 
no
 means certain that the defendants
would succeed in --

Then if we look at HSOC0012332, this is a letter dated
2
 
November 1990 from Mrs 
Thatcher
 to Alf Morris
 
MP.
It's the date upon which you were appointed Secretary of
State
, 
so highly unlikely, I think, that you would have
seen it before it went out
.  
The Inquiry has looked at this letter before
, 
so
I just want to go to the last paragraph on the second
page
.  
Mrs 
Thatcher, 
having set out various observations
about no-fault compensation
, then 
says:
"I
 am sorry 
if this is a disappointing 
reply but
t
he Government is showing its great concern for
 
54
hemophiliacs
 
with HIV, by the 
ex
-
gratia payments it is
making.  The question of compensation has to remain
a matter for the Courts to decide."
Then if we turn to a 
Departmental 
comment on that
letter, it's at DHSC0020866_100.  It's a minute dated
9
 
November 1990 from a 
Ms
 Stewart to Mr Kendall, not
a document copied to your 
private office
, but it says
this
:
"
... 
I see from today's Independent that the
Prime Minister has written to Alf Morris saying that any
compensation is a matter which must be settled in the
courts
.  
Thus
, 
it is speculated
, 
pre-empting any choice
Mr Waldegrave might have had in the matter."
Do you have any observation on that last sentence?

--Result #839--

Then if we can just look at your response to this
letter, there's one point I wanted to explore with you,
DHSC0004365_032.  It's the response of 26 November 1990
.
We can see
, 
if we go over the page, it's from you
.  
Then
if we go back to the previous page and the text of the
letter, third paragraph.  You say this:
"
But 
perhaps in turn I might make the Government's
position clear.  Those taking legal action are of course
entirely free to do so
, 
if they believe they are
entitled to compensation on grounds of negligence.  
But
it
 is their own choice.  The Government has not
encouraged them to take such action.  Indeed, by
providing financial help totalling £34 million for HIV
infected 
haemophiliacs and their families, with an
undertaking to keep the sum available under review,
we
 
have shown that it's not necessary to take legal
action to secure financial help."
Now, I am not going to ask you about the previous
two payments which had totalled the 34 million and what
 
59
had prompted those.  Those pre
-
date your time in office.
But in terms of the suggestion
 "
not necessary to take
legal action to secure financial help
", 
would it be
right to say that 
the
 action that you then took, which
secured the funding
, 
as we'll see shortly, to settle
the
 
litigation, and provide further financial assistance
to those infected, really was only forthcoming because
of the litigation, was it not?

--Result #840--

But you think issues such as the risk of setting
precedence and the risk of no-fault compensation would
have been discussed, those having been matters been
flagged up by the 
treasury
 officials
?

--Result #841--

And then we see Mr Mellor in paragraph 4 saying:
"
... 
it now appears that the other
, 
much smaller
costs 
- 
particularly in the case of the territorial
departments - are likely to fall in the next financial
year.  I can see little reason why such relatively minor
costs cannot be met from within next year's existing
provision, particularly since you have advance notice.
You are aware of the difficulties we have 
had
 to face on
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  109
public expenditure this year: it is already clear that
next year will be 
no
 easier.  I must therefore ask all
three departments to absorb these costs."
So in this letter Mr Mellor is saying 
no
 to any
additional provision 
from
 the Reserve for these
additional costs identified.
Can we then just pick up your letter in response
at DHSC0003660_007.
This is you on 25
 
March 1991 back to Mr Mellor.
If we just go a little further down, so we can see
the text
.  
So in point 2, you express concern at the
line Mr Mellor was taking about meeting legal costs.
You set 
out 
your understanding as 
according
 with that of
Mr Lang
: 
"... 
namely that compensation costs and reasonable
legal expenses for the plaintiffs would be made
available from the Reserve.
"
And in the last sentence of that paragraph you
say:
"I must thus ask you to maintain your earlier
agreement to meet legal expenses from the Reserve."
You then say, in paragraph 4:
"As your officials have been told, it is now
improbable that payments will be made in this financial
year as the legal 
process
 has not been complete
d
.
 
110
Therefore
 
the £42 million can be surrendered this year
but will be 
required
 from the Reserve in 1991-92.
I trust you can agree to this."
Now
, 
is this right
, 
Lord Waldegrave
, 
that when
you'd had your original discussions with Mr Mellor back
in December of 1990, it had been envisaged that it was
likely, although not, I think, guaranteed, that the
further discussions that were necessary to iron out the
full details of the settlement terms and secure
agreement of individuals, the hope was that would be
completed within the financial year, so that the
reserves that you were utilising would result in payment
out before the end of the financial year?

--Result #842--

Then I think we can probably therefore take the
remaining documents I hope fairly quickly.  You'd
received a letter from Ian Lang in January 1991
.  
It's at
 D
HS
C
0003660_009.
So dated 17
 
January, paragraph 1 refers to the
announcement on 11
 
December, and the second part of that
paragraph sets out Mr Lang's understanding that 
the
£
4
2 million is intended to cover the United Kingdom.
Mr Lang then says in the second paragraph:
"
... 
there are separate Scottish legal actions for
compensation but these 
had 
not progressed as far as the
English claims.  The Scottish lawyers concerned were not
represented on the steering committee and have not been
party to the preparation of the proposals nor involved
in the discussions which have taken place with the
Steering Committee.  This has placed the Scottish Office
in a difficult position since all the discussions on the
details of the settlement have been in relation to the
 
140
English plaintiffs, and there have already been
representations made to me by the Scottish lawyers that
they were not consulted before the offer was made
public.  They consider that they are not in a position
to advise their clients on acceptance or otherwise until
they know and can access the contents of the offer and
conditions of acceptance but also until they have fully
investigated their clients' claims.  It has not been
possible as yet to let them have sight
 
of the heads of
agreement since this has still to be 
finalised 
for the
English litigants, and will
, 
because 
it is drafted in
the context of English litigation, and in effect is
a response to an initial approach by the English
Steering Group, 
require
 
thereafter to be revised in
order to convey the offer properly for Scotland.  My
officials have been liaising with yours and it is hoped
to let the Scottish lawyers have a Scottish draft soon."
Then there is a suggestion that because of the
need to -- if we could just go over the page
 -- 
the
Scottish lawyers to assess the acceptability of the
proposals
, 
there needs to be an investigation of the
claims.
"
This 
would
 take some time 
and would
 conflict with
the 
shorter 
timetable which I understand is being
proposed for acceptance of the offer by English
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  141
plaintiffs.  Clearly we would wish to move in step with
you and other parts of the United Kingdom in making 
the
offer formally, but 
if a common date for acceptance is
imposed there is a risk that the Government will be
criticised by the legal profession and the public in
Scotland for attempting to steamroller the settlement
without giving an opportunity for adequate
investigations
 of the 
value of the 
claims by 
the 
legal
representatives of claimants and the consequent wisdom
of acceptance of the offer
 -- 
opportunities which 
[
were
]
given to claimants in England."
Then there is a request for a degree of
flexibility for the particular Scottish position
.
Before I ask you a question, if we can then look
at your response --

--Result #843--

Yes
, so just picking up then
, 
in the contemporaneous
 
148
documentation
, 
to start with
, 
DHSC0003657_119.
Now
, 
this
 
is a letter from a firm of solicitors in
Scotland.  It's date 18
 
December 1990.  It's addressed
to you and it's copied to, amongst others,
the
 
Prime Minister and to Robin Cook MP.  It says:
"Dear Minister 
...
"
I act for a number of people passed to me by the
Law Society of Scotland and from medical specialists and
my task is to attempt to obtain compensation for them as
a result of their having developed AIDS as a result of
whole blood transfusions which were HIV infected.
"I am
 sure that you will be aware of the
correspondence and submissions to your predecessor in
office and questions asked in Parliament by a number of
Members irrespective of political affiliation.
"
I have a copy of the detailed response made by
your predecessor to those questions but I still have not
had a rational or adequate explanation of how the
situation of people such as my clients can be
distinguished from that of the unfortunate haemophiliacs
who are also sadly 
afflicted
."
Then the next paragraph refers to the likelihood
of legal action, and then picking it up in the bottom of
the page:
"The only adequate and reasonable solution is
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  149
a settlement such as has been offered to the
haemophiliacs who are unfortunately also infected.  The
numbers of people infected through whole blood
transfusions is impossible to predict
 
but in my
experience in Scotland
 
despite efforts to ask them to
come forward, we have knowledge at present of very few.
Those I know of are in single figures.  Even 
if
a settlement
, 
however
, 
were to provoke many more claims,
surely it is only decent and honourable to meet those
claims.  Equally, from any objective point of view it
must be more sensible rather than expend money on
lawyers such as me through the Legal Aid Fund to
compensate the unfortunate victims, especially bearing
in mind that a number of them are very young people.
Indeed one of my clients is a 
five year
 old boy and
another an 
eighteen year
 old girl."
Then we see reference to the letter being copied
to the Prime Minister himself
:
"... 
because of the vital and desperate nature of
the situation faced by my clients."
Now
, 
I don't know whether this is a letter that
would have made its way to you.  I don't think the
documentation provides an answer to that.  I'll double
check.

--Result #844--

And 
then
 we can see the same issue being picked up now
by an MP in January of 1991, so about three weeks later
,
at DHSC0042272_145.
This is from John Marshall
, 
who 
was, 
I think we've
seen from other material
, 
a passionate advocate on this
issue
.  8
 
January
 
1991
.  It's addressed to
a Sydney Chapman MP, but he tells us at the bottom of
the letter that he's sending you a copy of it.
So it refers to the Rosie Barnes Bill
 -- 
and
that's the 
no
-
fault compensation Bill that we 
saw
referred to earlier
 --

--Result #845--

So if we look at the attached brief and line to
 
take
,
it's at DHSC0042272_143.  If we just 
zoom
 in.  The
 

5 July 2022

"
Background
"
:
"The figures relating to HIV/AIDS infection in UK
through blood transfusion are as follows:
"
reported cases infected with HIV 
... 
131
(
breakdown of place of transfusion not available)
"
reported cases 
with
 AIDS (as at November 1990)
...
"
Then there's a breakdown as 
between 
cases of
transfusion in the UK and cases abroad.
And 
2:
"The previous two 
awards to 
haemophiliacs
, 
in 1987
and 1989
, 
have been following by campaigns to give
similar financial help to those who have 
con
tracted
HIV/AIDS as a result of blood transfusions.
"3.  
The payments to haemophiliacs have recognised
the
ir
 wholly exceptional circumstances, whereby they
were doubly disadvantage
d 
by their pre-existing
haemophilia as well the 
HIV 
infection.
"4.  
We have accepted from the outset the need to
'
ring
 
fence
'
 haemophiliacs because of their special
circumstances.  People infected with HIV as a
 
result of
blood transfusion/transplants are 
no
 different in
principle from other groups of patients harmed as an
unfortunate side result of NHS treatment.  
For
 
example
,
there are cases which fall into the category of those
 
154
who acquired HIV through skin 
grafts 
or organ
transplants.
"5.  
Any special treatment for HIV infect blood
transfusion recipients would 
repercuss 
by exciting
expectations which would be difficult to contain in
other groups of patients harmed as an unintended
byproduct of NHS treatment.  The direct cost of
conceding 
for 
UK transfused cases with AIDS would
be
 
around £1 million and if all HIV cases are included
the cost could be around £5 million.  The more
exceptions 
that 
are made, the closer we move to
'
no fault compensation
' 
without discussing the
rationale
, 
and the
 
greater the number of claims that
would result from those 
who feel 
that they 
too
 are
deserving
.
"
And so
 
against that background
, 
the 
"
Line to take
"
that you were given
:
"
Payments for haemophiliacs recognise their unique
combination of circumstances
.  
These do not 
apply 
to
blood transfusion recipients."
So would it be fair to understand the departmental
line at this point in time is to hold
, 
or try to hold
the ring-fence and not extend the financial provision
any further?

--Result #846--

If we pick it up in the second paragraph, he says 
this
:
"The recent settlement with haemophiliacs who are
HIV positive has again raised awareness among this group
of the injustice of their position.  Frankly I find it
wholly untenable to accept that the NHS has
a responsibility to provide financial compensation to
one group who are HIV positive as a result of NHS
 

5 July 2022
          
          

  157
treatment whilst denying the same response to another
group of NHS patients who are also HIV positive as
a
 
result of NHS treatment.  I could understand, although
not accept, this distinction
, 
if the group to whom
liability was being denied was the larger group with
a larger cost
, 
but the continued refusal to accept
responsibility in this case is all the more difficult to
comprehend as the numbers involved are so few and the
cost of settlement would be so much less than the amount
already provided for the greater number of
haemophiliacs."

--Result #847--

Then he says:
"I do appreciate that it is important for the NHS
,
and 
no
 doubt the 
Treasury
, 
that a clear ring-fence is
drawn around any compensation made in order to avoid
a precedent for wider claims from other NHS patients
.
However
 
it does seem to me wholly untenable to try to
erect a 
ring fence
 around one group of HIV positive
patients, whilst leaving another group outside.  It
would surely be much more easy to defend a 
ring fence
which accepted that this precedent applied only to those
patients who became HIV positive as a result of
 
158
treatment with infected blood or blood products and did
not apply in any 
wider
 medical circumstances.
"These are the points which I have urged at
intervals over the past 
three
 years.  I hope though that
now 
there 
is obviously a greater willingness to resolve
this matter
 
it will be possible for you to take a fresh
look at the claim of this small group and put them on
a par with the settlement to haemophiliacs."
Leaving 
aside 
the point which you said you didn't
much like, is there anything else in Robin Cook's letter
that you would disagree with
?

--Result #848--

Yes
.  We 
may pick that up when we look at the document.
We can see the note in question is at
DHSC0003560_051.
So this from Mr Dobson
, 
dated 23
 
April 1991
.  
The
first paragraph refers to the fact that at the meeting
you'd asked for a note on the position.  And then
paragraph 2
, 
it said:
"
... 
the cost of a scheme limited to people with
HIV transfused in the UK would not be trivial
 --
probably some 
£
3
-
5m depending on assumptions
.  
But the
real difficulty over granting 
a concession would be to
re-establish a credible 
'
ring-fence
'
 to prevent any
further movement towards a general system of no fault
compensation.  The government has always justified its
special position for HIV
-
infected haemophiliacs on the
 
162
grounds that they are a uniquely unfortunate group
 - 
in
particular
, 
because the 
tragedy of infection with the
HIV virus was 
superimposed on a severe hereditary
disability.  In contrast, it is difficult to draw any
logical distinction between the HIV
-
infect
ed
 blood
transfusion cases and other victims of medical
accidents.  If ministers wish to reconsider the case for
some general system of no
-
fault compensation
 
that is
another matter
, 
but in my view, the worst of all
possible worlds would be to slide into no-fault
compensation through a series of reluctant concessions
to 
well
-
orchestrated campaigns.
"One final point is that 
Treasury
 would strongly
resist any further concession
, 
and might 
well
 accuse us
of bad faith in even considering it.  
(
The danger of
knock-on effects was raised with 
Treasury
 officials in
the discussions leading up to last December's
announcement, but the assumption was that a settlement
for the haemophiliacs could be ring-fenced.
)  
At 
a
 time
when the 
Treasury
 are trying to renege on their
agreement to fund haemophiliac settlement 
..."
That must be the spat we 
looked at
 earlier
,
Lord Waldegrave.

--Result #849--

Then if we look over the page
 -- 
I don't need to read
through the majority of the document.  So we can have
the whole page, Lawrence
.
This is what is attached to Mr Dobson's minute
.
If we go 
to
 
the
 next page, the arguments against
compensation start towards the bottom of the page.  I am
not going to read through the detail because
,
 
164
Lord Waldegrave
, 
you've given us your general response.
You'll see there the first point is about transfusion
abroad, and if we go over the page --

--Result #850--

Then we have a minute from
 -- 
or on behalf of the Chief
Medical Officer, around the same time, DHSC0002862_006.
This 
is 
29 April 1991
, 
from Jane Verity to
Mr Dobson
, 
copied to Mr Alcock, so it would have come to
your office
:
"CMO has seen your minute of 23 April which
supplied Secretary of State with a note on the present
position on compensation for people infected with HIV
through blood transfusion, and on the cost that would be
incurred if we were to extend to them the compensation
 
168
scheme for haemophiliacs.
"
CMO has commented that he thinks the only tenable
argument of differentiation from haemophilia of any
weight is in paragraph 3 of Annex 
--Result #851--

Yes.  And then we can see in the first paragraph it
says:
"The settlement of 42 million for the
haemophiliacs has sparked off a campaign for
compensation for those that 
become
 infected with HIV
through blood transfusion.  Similar campaigns were
resisted following the announcement of the first payment
of £10 million for the haemophiliacs in 1987 and the
announcement of the payment of £20,000 each in 1989.  On
this occasion The
 '
Observer
'
 
has picked up the issue and
given it a higher profile.  So far the Department has
received only one writ from a blood transfusion
recipient but there are signs that legal actions are
being considered by 
many more."
Under the heading "Justification":
"We have always justified the special provision
for haemophiliacs on the grounds that they were doubly
 
171
disadvantaged; the problems of HIV were superimposed on
the health, social and financial disadvantages they
already suffered as a result of their hereditary
haemophilia.  This combination of circumstances would
not generally apply to blood transfusion cases.  (Those
suffering from hereditary
 
thalassemia or
 
sickle cell
anaemia who require blood transfusions may claim to be
doubly disadvantaged
 
but there are thought to be few
with HIV).  However, it is very difficult to get this
argument across to the public
 
who have considerable
sympathy for the blood transfusion cases.  Those
campaigning on their behalf stress the similarities with
the haemophiliacs
; 
both groups 
were infected through
treatment and those infected could pass the HIV to their
families."

--Result #852--

And if we go over the page there's a list of pros and
cons for extending compensation.  
Pros:
"
(i) 
Relieves the political and media pressure at
 
172
present on the Government
;
"(ii) 
Reduces the risk of another round of
embarrassing and costly litigation and criticism for
'
forcing
'
 people with a fatal infection to take this
course
;
"(iii) 
Numbers and costs involved are relatively
small 
(
see Annex
)
 if the concession can be ring
-fenced;
"(iv) 
Removes the risk that a thalassemia or
sickle cell case will be highlighted
 and undermine our
justification for 
exceptional help for haemophiliacs.
"(v) 
While not all countries have state
compensation schemes for HIV victims, most of those that
we know about cover both blood transfusion and
haemophiliac cases 
(
eg Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Australia, Canada
)
."
So 
I think it's right to say that those pros are
all
 
either
 related to financial costs or to reputational
issues in relation to the Government.  There is 
no
articulation there of a moral case
, 
is there?

--Result #853--

Although we know from the CMO that he suggested 
that
would be 
no
 more than ten.
"
3.
 
Outside the HIV field there is already 
public
pressure for compensation for those children who
received with human growth hormone and who now be at
risk of developing 
[
CJD
]
."
If we go to the next page, last sentence of that
paragraph:
"Moreover
, 
there
 is 
a risk that additional people
will 
acquire CJD through 
corneal and other transplants.
"
(iv) 
There are other diseases 
transmitted though
blood and blood products.  In particular 
most
haemophiliacs were infected with hepatitis before blood
 
174
products were heat
-
treated.  This is less serious than
HIV and although transmitted sexually
 
a vaccine against
hepatitis B offers protection to spouses.  Few
haemophiliacs
 ... 
will die as a result of hepatitis
.
However
, 
there are early moves to try to seek
compensation for 
these 
people.  
Those accepting the HIV
settlement are precluded from raising the hepatitis
issue 
as the arguments are so similar to HIV.  However,
there are several thousand haemophiliacs who will not
share in the settlement and who may 
feel
 that they have
lost out and press
 
the hepatitis case.
"

And an example given there in relation to
benzodiazepine.
"(vi) 
Ring
-fencing 
the numbers may be very
difficult as HIV spreads beyond the high risk groups;
anyone who received blood before 
1985 and contracts HIV

 is 
unlikely to be feasible to establish the
source of 
infection
 with certainty."
Then the next paragraph:
"
(vii) 
It would undermine the Government's stance
on no
 
fault compensation and make it difficult to resist
 
175
pressures for a 
review."
Then if we go over the page we can see it 
is 
said
that
:
"Further concessions could have 
repercussions for
other Departments.
"
Paragraph 6:
"
Treasury
 seems likely to resist any further
concession.  
They have always been concerned that the
payments to the haemophiliacs could have wider
repercussions and have been anxious that those
concessions 
should be ring-fenced.
"

The concession to blood transfusion cases
might not remove the problem completely."
Then there is reference to the fact that there
would need to be a panel and the issue of patients
abroad.  Then 
8
 -- 
and indeed, sorry, I was wrong
earlier 
when
 I said the issue doesn't arise.  That same
point that we explored a few minutes ago,
Lord Waldegrave, is more shortly and succinctly
expressed 
here
.

--Result #854--

It's compressed.  There could be pressure on HIV testing
and counselling services and then there's a question as
to how it could raise fears generally about the safety
of the blood supply
.
 
176
Those are the pros and cons.  There's then
a section about options, which refers to, in
paragraph 10, 
it will:
"... 
exclude those transfused abroad 
... 
this is
defensible.
"
And it's said to be consistent with a scheme for
haemophiliacs which is limited to those treated in the
UK.  So that disposes of that concern.  Top of the next
page:
"A more credible ring-fence could be established
round all those infected with HIV 
through
 medical
treatment, as it would be very difficult to exclude
those few who have been infected with HIV with tissue or
organ transplant.  HIV is the emotive issue and the
public are unlikely to be convinced that it is
reasonable to compensate those who were infected by 
one
form of treatment but not another."
Then paragraph 12:
"If all those infect
ed
 with HIV through medical
treatment are to be compensate
d, 
in addition to
haemophiliacs
 
the justification for ring-fencing these
from all other victims of medical accident
s
 would be
that the HIV infection 
will
 be life
-
long and can be
transmitted to their spouses and children
.  
Apart from
using barrier methods of contraception

there is 
no
 way

  177
of preventing spread to their spouse
.  
These
considerations are not as true for people with other
injuries or infections."
Then there is a reference to no-fault
compensation, and it's suggested an alternative approach
could be a review of the case for a no-fault
compensation scheme.  I'm not going to 
read 
through
that.
If we go over the page, 
"
Conclusions
"
,
paragraph 15:
"The ring-fence round the haemophiliacs is
difficult to maintain.  Finding another place to
re-establish it is also difficult.  If there is to be
further movement then it might be possible to defend
a ring-fence around all HIV cases infected in the UK by
blood, organ and tissue donation undertaken as part of
medical treatment.  This further concession however
would send the wrong signals to other groups already
lining up to press their own case for compensation.
Re
-
opening the no-fault compensation issue would not
resolve the immediate problem and could be unattractive
on other grounds.  It comes down to a question of where
Ministers wish to take a stand against claims for
compensation."
Is it fair to read this
 as, 
in terms of the
 
178
perspective 
of departmental officials, not enthusia
stic
for a change in policy, but essentially saying
: 
it's
your job, ministers, if you want to change course?

--Result #855--
 "I have much sympathy with your comments and with  the 
points which the Society make.  As you may know, th e 
issue has already been ventilated in the House of L ords, 
where the minister explained that the government do es 
not accept liability for those infected by contamin ated 
blood products on the grounds that such patients 
received the best treatment available, given the me dical 
knowledge at that time. 52 
"Whilst a parallel can be drawn with those who 
contracted HIV, the minister claims that this was 
a special case, that the consequences are not compa rable 
and that agreeing to what would be in effect no-fau lt 
compensation could involve substantial expenditure,  not 
only for those cases, but for others of a similar n ature 
for which a precedent would have been created.
"However, having explained the government's stance,
I do accept that there is an argument for considera tion 
being given to ex gratia payments in certain cases and I 
shall seek opportunities to raise this in the House  of 
Commons or informally with ministers." 
So you were involved in trying to support a campaig n 
for payments for those who had been infected with 
hepatitis C.

Committee of the Privy Council." 
Then, page 3, it says, "Live to take" but I think 
it should read "Line to take":
"Up to this point we have maintained a line to 
take and whilst awaiting Law Officers advice and we  see 
no justification to move away from it. 
"'The report published on 6 November from the 
Scottish Expert Group on Financial and other Suppor t was

recommendations on hepatitis C relate only to those
people who contracted hepatitis C from blood or blo od

26 "'The Government's position remains as stated on 
many previous occasions in both Houses.  We still d o not

 Then if we can go back to page 2, please, Paul and we'll 
follow the email chain upwards. 
The email is from Sammy Sinclair to you.  Second 
paragraph: 
"[Secretary of State] is due to speak to 
[Secretary of State] at DWP in about an hour's time .  He

"You will wish to be aware of the latest

 There's no reference there to having to take work 
forward or doing any preparatory interest work for 
a hep C compensation scheme. 

--Result #859--
 Then:
"The current position is that Ministers here are 
sticking strongly to the no compensation line but 
Scottish Ministers have weakened.  Political pressu re in 
Scotland forced them to set up an expert group whic h 
recommended a fairly generous compensation scheme. 
After the expert group reported, Malcolm Chisholm, the 
Scottish Health Minister, went public with a lesser
offer of cash.  [Secretary of State] asked to see i f 
a way could be found to stop these.  The result was
a legal challenge saying that any payment scheme to
haemophiliacs would be a social security scheme and
therefore outside Scotland's devolved powers.  This
issue is currently with the law officers for 
a determination and we are expected them to give a view 
very soon.  If they decide in Scotland's favour, DW P 
will then need to decide whether to disregard such 
payments for social security purposes (as is the ca se 
with the Macfarlane Trust scheme)." 

--Result #860--
 We see at the bottom of the page a quote from Mr Re id.
"I'm pleased to be able to announce the details of 
this scheme today.
"I felt it was important that English Hepatitis C 
patients should receive these payments on compassio nate 
grounds.  It's clear that providing assistance is t he 
right thing to do. 
"I believe that these are fair and reasonable 
payments and I hope that they will help alleviate s ome 
of the problems people who have been affected in th is 
way are experiencing."
Then if we can go to DHSC5328495, please.  
We have a memo that you wrote in November 2003 to 
the private secretary.  We're going to come to the 
detail of this memo a little bit later but I just w ant 
to pick up one paragraph for now, and that's  
36 paragraph 14 on page 4, please.  And it reads this:
"It may be possible to placate these issues 
[issues which we will explore later this morning] b y 
stressing that the original philosophy of the schem e was 
to provide ex gratia payments to all of those who 
developed chronic hepatitis C as a result of inadve rtent 
infection from blood or blood products.  This would
emphasise the fact that payments are not being made  on 
the ground of past or current suffering, but on 
compassionate grounds because this is the right thi ng to 
do." 
Then I will ask a question at the end of this.  If 
we can look at DHSC5328644, please. 
If we can turn to page 2, please, to start, 
because it's an email chain going backwards, we hav e an 
email from David Reay to Bob Stock, with you cc'd. 
It's at the bottom of this page, Paul, please.
In which David Reay indicates that there had been 
a "deluge of PQs on the hep C scheme", and he says:
"For most we can stonewall with the 'details still 
being worked out' line but one of the questions ask s 
this. 
"Mr Mike Hancock (Portsmouth South): ... what 
research his Department (a) has commissioned and (b ) is 
evaluating in order to determine the level of                                   
 
                             7 compensation ..." 
Sorry, I've picked up the wrong reference, sir. 
Can I just take a moment?  Apologies. 
No, I haven't.  Let me start again.  Apologies, 
sir.
We're looking at an email from David Reay to 
Bob Stock about a PQ that had been asked, and David  Reay 
says this: 
"We can say that we, if not evaluated, then 
certainly considered the Lord Ross and Haem Soc Wor king 
Group recommendations, but we certainly haven't 
commissioned anything.  Seeing as we basically 
transposed your proposals and bearing in mind you'v e 
gone public and we need to try and avoid being seen  to 
be led by Scotland, is there anything we can say wa s 
commissioned when you determined your proposals!! 
I don't remember you saying that any studies were 
undertaken, more that you based the proposals on th e 
Lord Ross awards, but just in case ...!"
We will come back to the Lord Ross point, but 
there's then a reply to David Reay from Sandra Falc oner,
because Bob Stock was on leave, and she provided a line 
to take that had been used in a meeting with 
Philip Dolan, and it's the last paragraph of this e mail:
"The underlying principle behind the ex gratia  
38 payments announced is that they should go to people  who 
are still alive and suffering.  Have to weigh the i ssue 
of making a fair and reasonable payment to these pe ople 
against all the other demands on the health budget. " 
So we see there Ms Falconer's explanation about 
the underlying principle. 
From those three documents and from many others in 
the files, there are a number of explanations given  as 
to what the underlying principles are or the purpos e of 
the payments are.  Firstly, in relation to the 
references to payments being made on compassionate 
grounds but not being because of past or current 
suffering, and that was in your memo, can you expla in 
then what the payments were for?  What was meant by
"compassionate grounds"? 

--Result #861--
 Then we carry on "Funding the scheme": 
"As the Law Officers have ruled that this is 
a health issue, the costs of the scheme in England would 
need to be borne by the Department of Health.
"The Treasury have said that no additional funding 
would be available for a hepatitis C compensation 
scheme.  Any such scheme would need to be funded fr om 
SR2002 settlements.  We would need to work with the
Devolved Administrations to attempt to reduce and/o r 
re-profile the cost." 
Again, is it fair that, from this document, cost 
was a key issue of concern for the Department -- 

--Result #862--
  These refer in the main to thos e 
patients who have received payment elsewhere or who  have 
undergone some sort of medical treatment as a resul t of 
the infection." 
If we go forwards to page 4, which is the annex, 
we see eight points: 
"Exceptions and Variations to the Hepatitis C 
Scheme 
"1.  People who have cleared the virus 
spontaneously would not be eligible for any payment . 
"2.  People who have received payments linked to 
HIV infection from the Macfarlane Trust or the 
associated Government scheme of payments shall not be 
eligible for the basic payment.  They will receive the 
additional payment if they reach the medically defi ned 
trigger point. 
"3.  People who clear the virus under treatment 
shall only receive the basic payment. 
"4.  People who receive a liver transplant shall 
receive both the basic and the additional payment. 
"5.  People who have received compensation as 
a result of a successful legal action against the N HS  
62 (or an out-of-court settlement in relation to a leg al 
action) shall have that compensation/settlement ded ucted 
from the total award made under this scheme.
"6.  People who have received compensation as 
a result of a successful legal action against a pro duct 
supplier shall have that compensation deducted from  the 
total award made under this scheme. 
"7.  People who receive payments under this scheme 
shall undertake not to institute further legal 
proceedings against the NHS or Ministers. 
"8.  No payment shall be made to the relatives, 
dependants or estates of eligible claimants who wer e 
deceased at the time the scheme became operative." 
In terms of the exceptions and variations it's 
right, isn't it, that there's no reference here to 
a cut-off date that treatment had to have been rece ived 
before September 1991? 

--Result #863--
   Thank you. 
Mr Gutowski, I have a handful of questions to ask 
you.  They cover a whole range of different issues so 
we'll move across different things that we've discu ssed 
today.
First of all, in relation to your evidence that 
staff levels were reduced and you ended up with jus t one 
other person in the blood policy part of the work y ou                                   
 
                             37 were doing, given that hepatitis was an issue and t hat 
by then you knew a compensation scheme was pending,  did 
you raise concerns about the lack of staffing and 
support that you had? 

--Result #864--
 The lump sum was brilliant but when you're in pri vate 
rented you're paying out a lot of rent and it's dea d 
money.  If I can just collect my thoughts. 
My parents weren't aware that as this was 
compensation any benefits that they had applied for
that amount of money shouldn't be taken into accoun t,
so that money was classed as savings so they receiv ed 
no benefits.  We've since found out as a result of the 
Inquiry that that's incorrect and that has actually
now been corrected with my mother's -- with the mon ey 
my Mum now receives but at the time it was a godsen d 
but it didn't last long enough.

--Result #865--
 Well, I think in my witness statement, I use the word 
"transactional" and that's a correct description of  my 
relationship with the Skipton Fund.  And also it wa s 
me that had to be proactive.  So initially it was 
Bill.  In the early 2000s, he'd read in the paper t hat 
there was some compensation available and he wrote to 
the Department of Health at that point and asked wh at 
he should do and they advised him to approach the 
Skipton Trust which he duly did.  In 2005, I think it 
was, he got a payment from the Skipton Trust but it
was couched in a way that "this is it, you know, 
that's your payment", you know, and we were very  
 
 1 
grateful to have any money at all because we'd give n 
up on the idea that there would either be an inquir y 
or any proper investigation of what had happened an d
we'd given up on the idea there would be any 
compensation.  So it was, you know, like manna from
heaven really. 
But that's how it was.  It was not explained what 
it was for.  It was a payment I was going to get 
because the Department of Health had agreed that th ese 
payments should be made.  There was no investigatio n 
of his family circumstances or, you know, how has i t 
affected your -- there was no sort of negotiation, it 
was transactional. 
Then later, after Bill died, there was -- I got 
a letter in the post actually forwarded on to me by
the Royal Free, I believe, saying that they'd been 
contacted by The Skipton Fund (this is four years 
after his death) to say that Bill was owed a second
stage payment.  And the letter that had come with t hem 
had come from Skipton and they sent that 
correspondence on in which Skipton had found out th at 
he'd died or been told he'd died and they were then
pursuing the second stage payment, because it was 
clear for his death certificate that a second stage
payment was due. 2 
So in 2013 I think I had a payment of the same 
amount as had been given to Bill initially and that
was also regarded as the final stage.  And then in 
2017, I read somewhere about bereavement payments; so 
I contacted Skipton at that point.  This is, like,
eight years after Bill's death and they said, "Oh, 
yes, yes, you're definitely due a bereavement payme nt 
but we're shutting up shop; so, you know, this is i t 
now.  This is your bereavement payment.  Provide th e 
death certificate and we'll just send it to you" wh ich 
is what they did. 
So they didn't make any bones about it.  They were 
never awkward or difficult, they just weren't 
proactive, everything was late and it was done real ly 
in a way "that's it".  When I rang the chap to talk
about it, he said, "Look", he said, "this isn't 
anything to do with me.  These are decisions made 
elsewhere", you know, and it was sort of you should  be 
just grateful, really, which we were.  We were 
grateful to have any help from them.  But then he 
said, "There's 10,000 people like you" like it was my 
fault there were 10,000 people like me.  And I thou ght 
at the time 10,000 people?  That's a huge number of
people. 
I became aware, I suppose for the first time, of  3 
the scale of this because, you know, he told me abo ut 
the other trusts and I also became aware at that po int 
that the levels of compensation were being paid out
were very, very different by the different trusts.
And I started getting in touch with other people th at 
had been affected and found out by the All 
Parliamentary Group on Contaminated Blood and I als o 
referred back then to my -- I'd given a statement t o 
the Archer Inquiry earlier and done various things to 
try and raise my concerns, but we'd never had anyth ing 
back, not even acknowledgements, of any of the 
correspondence.  It just contributed to this genera l 
feeling that nobody really cared enough to do anyth ing 
about it.

--Result #866--
 Well, I wanted to know what the Haemophilia Society 's 
view about litigation was.  Because a lot of cases 
were being brought which had little chance of succe ss, 
because to succeed, they would have had to prove 
individual negligence, and the patients in question
had not been managed in an unusual way.  There were
patients who had severe haemophilia but were,
nevertheless, claiming that they should have been 
treated with DDAVP, though they would not have 
responded to that. 
Now, I had every sympathy with their desire to be 
compensated, because they had clearly been damaged by 
their treatment.  And my feeling at that time was t hat 
surely this was a classical example of a situation where 
there should be some form of no-fault compensation 
scheme.  But, in fact, I was told that whilst there  was 
all this litigation going on in the background, no such  
136 scheme would be put together. 
So, you know, a lot of the litigation that was goin g 
on at that point seemed unlikely to succeed.  There  was 
more and more of it.  We then had the campaign wher e 
a whole series of patients from around the country 
reported the Centre Directors to the General Medica l 
Council, claiming various acts of professional 
misconduct, which were, as far as I knew, and certa inly 
in relation to the two complainants against me, 
completely false. 
And, you know, I was very sympathetic towards 
a campaign for compensation, but that was hardly 
calculated to get me on site.  How would you feel i f 
someone made a complaint to the Bar Council about y ou, 
for example?
So -- and I had gained the impression that elements
in the Haemophilia Society were encouraging this.  It 
was a slightly circular problem, though, because wh en 
I was a little bit more senior, a little bit furthe r on, 
and was talking to the Department of Health, what t hey 
told me was, so long as there was litigation going on in 
the background, they couldn't put any scheme into p lace, 
because it would influence the outcome of the 
litigation. 
And I think a lot of my colleagues and I felt as if 
 we were slightly caught in the crossfire, because w e 
were the closest target for the patients' ire, they
blamed their medical attendants for their suffering , and 
we were not in any position to help with financial 
compensation.  It was really the Department of Heal th 
that they needed to approach.  But we were the only
outlet, and they sought to increase the profile of their 
campaign by suing us all and reporting us to the 
General Medical Council.

 -- my ramblings.  Firstly, I'd like to thank 
Sir Brian and all the Inquiry team for the opportun ity 
to have our experiences, shall we put them, heard. 
I would also like to thank all the staff at 
Collins solicitors because I believe without their 
tenacity I fear this Inquiry might never had got to
where it is.  I would just like to relay, having 
already seen and heard because this has been going on 
a long time, some of the excuses of the scandal 
publicly aired by the professions.  I would just li ke 
to clarify some what I call disseminated opinions. 
I want to start with the definition of 
an accident.  That is it is an unfortunate incident     111 that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, 
typically resulting in damage or injury.  That's th e 
definition.  Even the limited witness statements an d 
evidence gathered to date I think we can quite safe ly 
say I don't think there was anything unintentional or 
unexpected that happened here.  So I proffer that 
anyone that puts forward the word "accident" in 
defence of this just wasn't worthy to hold a post t hat 
they had, whether it be consultant, minister or civ il 
servant. 
Next you would be the knowledge.  Classic 
statement, "We didn't know about these viruses".  Y ou 
know, it is documented evidence in the '70s and '80 s. 
You only have to go on Google and look at the 
journals.  The proof was there.  Academics were 
forewarning of problems with pooled blood, hepatiti s. 
There is only one group of people in my opinion 
who were truly unaware of the consequences of plasm a 
products and pooled products and that was us, the 
patients.  Any of these people, if they were given 
half of the knowledge available at the time, and I am 
saying at the time, they would have declined that 
treatment. 
"We didn't realise non-A non-B, which is now hep 
C, was anything other than benign."     112 Well, if this is a true statement, why were 
these pharmaceuticals and research programmes throw ing 
money and money and money to isolate the virus, 
establish a test, studying the observable recorded 
liver abnormalities, this is research documents tha t 
people can see.  It is just a lie.  It is just not 
true. 
Another classic is most haemophiliacs would have 
died, you know, before their 20s without any 
treatment.  It is not true.  I was 10 years old. 
I could have gone on to 30 years old, 40 years old,
with a bit of ice, a bag of peas.  That's what I ha d 
before.  I have never had and I don't think most mi ld 
haemophiliacs will have ever had a life saving 
treatment.  I have certainly had a life altering 
treatment, but never a lifesaving one. 
Finally, I will just briefly touch on this,
no-one wants to discuss it.  It is the one thing th at 
threads the scandal together.  The source of the 
plasma, the import and export agents, the customs, the 
drug agencies, the pharmaceutical companies, the 
governments, the ministers, the hospitals and now u s 
the victims is the money. 
True compensation doesn't need to be complicated 
and the finance people who are made to pay      113 compensation through authorities are making it 
complicated because they can. 
I don't want another tailored round much 
schemes.  I am sick of schemes.  Schemes ain't goin g 
to help me.  Means testing isn't going to help me. 
The means testing they had didn't even truly means 
test.  They didn't measure your income to your 
outgoings.  Theyy just went, "You were earning that
much.  You are not getting it". 
I don't want any more discrimination of virus 
types and manipulated virus stages.  These are just
tried and tested tactics, divide and conquer.  We k now 
them. 
Any payments that are made, if any, if Sir Brian 
can get these governments to come to the table and 
make payments, they need to be paid to all 
haemophiliacs, all those affected, those that have 
died, they shouldn't be ignored.  They don't deserv e 
no money.  It's got to go to their widow or their 
estate and that includes people who were consequent ly 
infected as well by haemophiliacs.  I think that's 
about all I need to say.

--Result #870--
 Yes, if I may. 
I'd like to thank, first of all, Sir Brian and 
to the Inquiry.  Thank you for letting the victims and 
families talk.  It's something we've not been able to 
do for decades.  To live in our world, in our 
community, in silence for so long because we're sca red 
of basically what people think, what loved ones thi nk, 
people, friends.  But we sort of work together.  We
had that bond together and I'd just like to say tha nk 
you for everyone giving their statements because it
takes an awful lot of courage, it really does. 
I've met some amazing people in the campaign 
groups.  I mean, they're incredible people.  These 
people are like brothers and sisters to me and that 's 
what we're like.  We're like a band of brothers and
sisters against something that should never have 
happened.  It should never have happened. 
When you look at how we got infected and you      111 look at the mistakes that were made, the whole 
political ideology, if I can put it that way, which
led to the disaster, where self-sufficiency produci ng 
Factor VIII and clotting factor from UK-sourced blo od,
those plans were scrapped again because of one thin g:
because of money.  And money has been at the heart of 
the disaster.  It's why it's never, ever been 
resolved. 
I would just like to quickly quote something. 
This is from a book written by Simon Garfield, an 
extract from a book called The End of Innocence.  H e 
attributes this to Edwina Currie: 
"Because there are a lot of them and it was 
expensive.  Simple as that.  It is not Government 
policy to compensate people who are the subject of 
medical accidents.  We looked very seriously at 
compensation possibilities to avoid poor souls havi ng 
to take cases to court.  But the cost of doing it w as 
horrendous because compensation usually in this 
country takes into account loss of earning power an d 
potential length of life.  So you're talking about 
settlements of 1 million.  Another less public 
argument received much support at the Department of
Health.  Payments would have gone to people who ain 't 
going to get better, whose medical circumstances ar e      112 not going to improve, Currie says.  Many of the mor e 
recent compensation cases will pay money during the
individual's lifetime rather than a lump sum but th e 
practice then firmly was to give a lump sum based o n 
a calculation and then your haemophilia patient mig ht 
die three weeks later and, hey presto, you've got 
a very wealthy family.  They haven't got haemophili a,
they haven't got AIDS but they've got a million qui d 
of public money which could have been used to help 
treat other patients.  And on the whole that contin ued 
to be my feeling.  If people are hurt inevitably by
treatment that in fact has made their lives better,
it's awfully difficult to see where the legal posit ion 
might lie."
I think that just sums up why not just this 
present Government but previous governments have no t 
looked at it.  It has all been down to money.  It's
all been down to political people held responsible for 
what they did. 
It's also the pharmaceutical companies.  1970s, 
1980s Cutter was the biggest producers of Factor VI II 
and Factor IX in the world.  Bayer, as I know now,
basically took over Cutter.  They have 
a responsibility, as well as the other pharmaceutic al 
companies, as well as the Government, to do somethi ng      113 now. 
What really worries me is we had over 107 people 
die so far since the Inquiry was announced back in 
Parliament in 2017.  More people are going to die b y 
the end of this Inquiry.  That's going to happen an d I 
know that plays on everyone's mind in this room.  A nd 
we have a duty -- we have a duty -- to those people
who aren't going to be here by the end of the Inqui ry 
to do the right thing and do the right thing now.  
And I think that the Government need to realise 
that.  We need to stop the games because there's be en 
a lot of games trying to get the Department of Heal th,
for example, off at the Inquiry has been -- it's be en 
awful how the games that they have played and the 
people -- they just don't seem to care and I think 
I can say that throughout the whole of the disaster , 
that people don't seem to care from Government 
officials, pharmaceutical companies, even some 
haematologists.  
And that's the thing with the tragedy.  It's 
just been a -- and still going on.  The disaster is
still happening.  It's not it's over 30 or 40 years
ago.  It's still happening right now.  It is up to the 
Government to say enough's enough and do the right 
thing.  People have suffered for too long and it's      114 been -- and just do the right thing in society beca use 
we owe it to the people we've lost, we owe it to th e 
ones who are alive, and we owe it to generations so
this never, ever happens again because it could hap pen 
again.  We have pharmaceutical companies -- again,
profits are more important than people's lives. 
The people who died, if you hear all the 
figures, and it's the numbers.  These aren't just 
numbers.  They're people.  They are real lives, rea l 
families destroyed, smashed to pieces.  It was 
genocide total genocide.  
We deserve to have the people who have questions 
to answer to appear in front of the Inquiry, not to
write letters, not to try and dodge out of things, not 
to try and say the same old thing, "Oh, there's 
nothing else we could have done" because the people
we've lost deserve answers.  The families deserve 
answers.  We deserve answers so, as I say, it never
happens again. 
I just wanted to quickly say this about this 
form which is the EIBSS form for funding for certai n 
things for people who are infected.  The thing that
I could not believe when I saw this is to apply for
a funeral prepayment plan payment, the applicant mu st 
send this in: a completed discretionary one-off      115 payment application form and a quote for the 
prepayment funeral plan.  A quote for a pre-paid 
funeral plan.  It says here a copy of the funeral 
invoice or receipt. 
We're not talking about double glazing.  We're 
not talking about something that is trivial.  A wid ow 
gets that and has to go through that.  Haven't they
been through enough already?  There doesn't seem to  be 
any thought, there doesn't seem to be any humanity and 
that's the thing that was lost with what happened t o 
us.  Humanity lost in madness and chaos; as I say,
political ideology; pharmaceutical greed. 
There are people who have to answer for what 
happened no matter how difficult this is, they must
answer for what happened.  We cannot -- we cannot h ave 
closure until that happens, sir.  We cannot have 
closure until that happens.  We have lost too much and 
we're going to lose even more. 
This thing has consumed so many.  Even in the 
campaign, we lose people and we keep going and we l ose 
people, we keep going, people get ill, you don't se e 
them anymore.  It's just ... why would people in 
authority allow this to continue?  It's just wrong 
and, as I say, it's something that the Government 
needs to look at now and act on.      116 That's all I wanted to say.

--Result #871--
 Yes. 
If anyone had told me in 1985 that I would still 
be campaigning in 2019 more than 34 years later 
I probably would have said they were stark raving m ad. 
That I am still campaigning demonstrates to me that
there is something fundamentally wrong in this 
country.  Time after time after time we have seen 
victims having to fight for many years in order to 
achieve justice.  Most recently the Hillsborough 
families whose campaign like ours went on for decad es. 
There has to be a better way.
One clear reason for this is that people are3 having to do battle directly with the perpetrators.
In the case of Hillsborough it was the football clu b 
and the police whereas with us our campaign has bee n 
aimed at the very heart of Government as well as 
prominent members of the medical and scientific 
community and the giant, all-powerful pharmaceutica l 
companies.
All of them have held more power and financial 
clout than we could ever muster and they know it.  On 
most occasions we have had to finance our campaigni ng 
ourselves although one notable exception to this, t he 
judicial review in 2010, proved to us that with 
properly financed legal representation we could win
through. 
Our ongoing battles have been compounded by the 
fact that financial support for victims has been se t 
up by the very Government department at the heart o f 
the scandal in the first place.  Hence it has never
been compensation, despite the word still being in 
regular use by some members of the press.
Instead, it has been  ex gratia , meaning no 
liability support, and therein lies the true shame of 
successive governments who have used this very supp ort 
system to divide and rule its victims.  Many years ago 
in Ireland, a system of no fault compensation on4 compassionate grounds was instituted; so it can be 
done if the will is there.  Clearly, in Westminster  it 
is not. 
Following on from that, I would like to commend 
the campaigners for their tenacity and their courag e 
in the face of such abject cruelty from those whose
actions and inactions caused this and who should ha ve 
helped and supported us.  Many of those I knew at t he 
beginning are no longer with us and I am sure that 
suits the Government perfectly for when one day,
hopefully not too far away now, they are forced to 
provide proper compensation their bill will be very
much smaller than it would have been had they done the 
right thing at the start. 
Not of course that they will shed any tears over 
this or, as Mr Kenneth Clarke said in January 1985 
when he was Minister of State for Health "as only 
haemophiliacs have died" -- "only haemophiliacs", I  am 
completely convinced that from the outset 
haemophiliacs were viewed as expendable.  Not by al l 
the doctors (as we have heard many of them were 
excellent) and certainly not by most of the nurses.
But the UKHCDO, the unknown (as yet) civil servants , 
the pharmaceutical companies, and members of the 
British Government (some still serving) truly have5 blood on their hands.  Haemophiliacs in the early d ays 
were a compliant, finite, trusting group that was w ell 
used to hospitals, blood tests and so on.  They 
readily co-operated with their doctors, believing t hem 
to be acting in their best interests.  I make no 
apology for saying that the majority of our communi ty 
are not like that now. 
There were so many warnings in the early days,
including two from the World Health Organisation.  We 
should and could have achieved self-sufficiency in our 
blood supply and raised donation standards before a ny 
damage was done.  But then, as now, the health and 
safety of our population proved to be a very low 
priority in terms of Government spending and attent ion 
to detail.  I've always maintained that this is not
about affordability.  The money was there for 
self-sufficiency and it is there for compensation 
today.  What is lacking is what Haydn Lewis used to
call political will.  We have simply never been 
important enough.  We are still not important enoug h. 
We are not a priority. 
Or in the now familiar words of Edwina Currie:
your haemophilia patient might die three weeks late r 
and, hey presto, you've got a very wealthy family.
They haven't got haemophilia.  They haven't got AID S6 but they've got a million quid of public money. 
There was a timelag of around three years 
between HIV infection in haemophiliacs in the US an d 
those in the UK.  Three years.  What would the aver age 
person in the street have used those three years fo r 
I wonder?  I suspect that the vast majority would h ave 
put urgent measures in place to protect haemophilia cs 
over here from suffering the same fate as those in 
America.  After all, we knew perfectly well decades
before this time that blood can carry viruses,
particularly hepatitis, and we knew that we were 
importing vast amounts of American plasma products.
It really shouldn't have been that hard, should it?
They had three years in which I believe most of the
infections to haemophiliacs could have been avoided . 
Three years. 
Instead, they did the opposite.  Effectively 
they sat back and monitored the spread of AIDS into
the UK.  I'd like to make one other thing clear. 
I said to my evidence to the Archer Inquiry that th is 
scandal was wholly avoidable and I stand by that. 
A child could have made better decisions over 
haemophilia care. 
Many times over the years I have heard 
campaigners say that there have been breaches of th e7 Human Rights Act and the Nuremberg Code.  Following
much research, I have to say I agree but then I'm n ot 
an expert.  I do hope, though, that the Inquiry tea m 
will look at these claims and make some kind of 
judgment on them.  If our assertions are incorrect,
then so be it.  But please tell us why.  If we were
right all along, then of course we would expect the
perpetrators to be identified and to face appropria te 
action. 
I want to say a few words about HIV infection. 
We've all heard the utterly devastating testimonies  of 
those who were infected with hepatitis C.  The viru s 
and its treatments are undeniably horrendous.  It i s 
a slow, creeping, insidious taker of lives and it i s 
taking more and more.  It should be remembered that
haemophiliacs have been exposed to multiple viruses ,
prions and other contaminants through their treatme nt.
But for those with HIV, there is a greater burden t han 
is often acknowledged.  There are very few survivor s 
today from the co-infected group.  Less than a quar ter 
remain with us and the way they have been treated b y 
the Department of Health and the support schemes ha s 
been utterly despicable.  I am absolutely certain t hat 
in the early days when there was no treatment 
whatsoever and when life expectancy was so low that      98 the Government believed that this particular proble m 
would soon be out of the way.  Fast forward three 
decades and the treatment of the co-infected has be en 
appalling throughout.  The extra impact of the two 
viruses has never been openly acknowledged by 
Government, despite the fact that studies commissio ned 
by them have proved it conclusively. 
The fact that this small group has acted as 
guinea pigs for every HIV medication as it comes on
the market has been ignored.  I'm sick to death of 
people telling me it's okay now, is AIDS, it's 
treatable, just like diabetes, in fact.  No, it 
certainly is not.  Those who are still alive 
contracted the virus around 30 years ago and by the
time any treatments came along, their immune system s 
were shot to ribbons.  They all faced daily a nasty
drug routine which, if they are lucky, keeps the vi rus 
at bay.  If the drugs stop working or they stop tak ing 
their meds, they will die. 
The first drug that game along, AZT, was 
initially prescribed in such high doses that the 
majority of people who took it did not survive. 
Haemophiliacs, along with other early victims, have
been guinea pigs or pioneers for every treatment fo r 
HIV as it came on the market.  Because of them, and  in9 particular the small group alive today, we are now 
able to treat HIV provided it is detected early.  T his 
country, and indeed the world, owes these people 
a huge debt of gratitude. 
It's often been said that the Government is 
stringing this out until we are all dead and I beli eve 
that could well be the case.  Over the years, I hav e 
often said confidently to the press and to politici ans 
that even if when this happens, the campaign will 
continue thanks to the children of victims who will
carry on our fight.  I have to be honest and say th at 
often as I said that I was thinking "Will they real ly 
or will we all be forgotten when the last one dies? "
I am so glad to be able to say that I was right.  O ver 
the last few years, the grown-up children have rise n 
like a flock of phoenixes and they are awesome.  Th ey 
have built on what we've tried to do and their shee r 
energy and determination is quite formidable.  I wo uld 
like to take this opportunity to thank them all for
their courage. 
Thanks must go to Sir Brian and the Inquiry 
team, including the technical squad, and to Collins
Solicitors, all of whom have been incredibly 
supportive throughout and have granted me the 
privilege of giving evidence today.  I'm sure we      100 haven't been the easiest people to deal with on 
occasion.  Indeed, we have probably driven you mad at 
times, but hopefully you will realise why we're lik e 
we are.  It's truly not personal, I promise.  To be
frank, it's all been a bit bewildering as we're rea lly 
not used to the sort of treatment you have given us . 
I looked around this room earlier in the year and 
thought: all this for us?  So thank you for treatin g 
us with kindness and dignity. 
To the victims who have given testimony, we 
applaud you for your bravery in telling your story.
To the haemophilia community.  You are astonishing.
You are kind, protective of each other, generous, 
supportive, and the most bloody-minded determined
group of people I know.  I am certain that if Garet h 
had survived -- and we miss him terribly -- he woul d 
have been so proud of what TB has become.  He'd nev er 
actually have told you that, of course, but I know 
he'd have felt it.  
I recently read an old Mexican proverb that 
information sums up the campaigners nicely: 
"They tried to bury us.  They didn't know that 
we were seeds."
My final message is to the people that caused 
this in the first place.  It's to the politicians w ho      101 have lied, including on several occasions misleadin g 
the House; to the doctors who didn't see children,
babies and mild haemophiliacs but simply guinea pig s 
ripe for experiment; to the pharmaceutical companie s 
and the scientists whose greed and tunnel vision ro de 
rough shod over one of society's most vulnerable 
groups, to all of you I say this: you have taken aw ay 
so much from so many people.  Your actions have tak en 
people's health, their financial independence, thei r 
dignity, often their homes, their families, marriag es 
and their friendships and, in thousands of cases, l ife 
itself leaving behind bereaved families, orphaned 
children and a grief that for many is still as raw as 
the day their loved one died.  You have reduced man y 
of us to rock bottom.  But you know what: you can't
take the most important things, the things that you
yourself have lacked, humanity and the love that bi nds 
us together. 
I am extraordinarily proud of what I see every 
day on the TB Facebook group.  If someone is down,
there is a flurry of messages to support them.  If 
someone has a problem and needs advice, that advice
comes in shed-loads.  If someone is dying or sick,
I see a gentleness and a reaching out to do what we
can to help.  When someone dies virtual arms are      102 wrapped around the family and someone is always the re 
for them.  This amazing support and compassion goes  on 
pretty well 24 hours a day.  I know a lot of noctur nal 
people. 
We know that we are just very little fish in 
a very big pond and that because of your money and 
your power you have always had the upper hand.  But  we 
have one overwriting quality that gives me some hop e 
and that is the truth.  We have only ever told it a s 
it is and it is the truth that has been heard so fa r 
by this Inquiry.  I, and I imagine hundreds of othe rs,
are sick and tired of your platitudes and your 
tree-hugging simpering.  We don't want to hear that
you deeply regret or that you are sorry.  Nor do we
want to hear that it should never have happened.  O f 
course it should never have happened.  That much wa s 
understood by us decades ago and surely to goodness
isn't rocket science. 
No, we only want to hear one thing from you and 
that's the truth.  We want to know why a human life
was downgraded ahead of scientific research and mak ing 
money, and why the victims you created have since b een 
treated as second-class citizens.  If you have to b e 
dragged kicking and screaming to this Inquiry, then  so 
be it.  Please don't think that sudden memory loss,     103 old age or ill health will be an acceptable excuse not 
to turn up or to give inadequate evidence.  You won 't 
fool us and I'm pretty sure you won't fool the Inqu iry 
team either. 
My hope then is that this Inquiry will give us 
closure but if it all goes pear-shaped, then all I can 
say is that history will be your judge and for that
I'm very glad. 
Final thanks must go to Andy Evans for sitting 
with me today and also the many other campaigners f or 
their amazing support.  A special mention must be 
given to my incredible and talented friend, Richard
Warwick, without whom the next bit would not be 
possible. 
I want to finish with a very short list of 
names.  I must stress that they are no more or less
important than anyone else who has died because we 
have all known huge losses.  However, as people who
have been associated closely with Tainted Blood, an d 
who in some cases campaigned for decades, literally  up 
until they died, they represent other campaigners,
UK-wide, who have quietly and privately suffered th e 
same fate due to the wicked intransigence and abjec t 
cruelty of Government.  Their efforts have been no 
less value.      104 Having said that of course the first name is 
that of someone who never campaigned in his short 
lifetime but who has become the one who gets us 
through the night and whose image makes us pull 
ourselves together when we feel like giving up.  So ,
on behalf of everyone in Tainted Blood, please join  me 
to remember the following with thanks and gratitude
for what they did and what we have tried to continu e 
doing in their memory.

--Result #872--
   On that note, sir, we start our submissions with
gratitude and appreciation for the immense commitment
and hard work of all of the infected and affected
individuals involved in this Inquiry, their families and
their supporters, both those we represent and those we 
    82do not.
Decades of tenacity from this community have led us
here today and it is imperative for you, Sir Brian, to
act now to speak truth to power on behalf of this
community, especially in light of the submissions we
heard last week from the Department of Health and Social
Care and, in some respects, NHSBT.
We submit that this Inquiry has shown what our
clients have always known, that those in power
deliberately avoided the pursuit of truth and justice
over four decades for fear of being criticised.
On behalf of the Leigh Day team, I would like to
thank all of our Core Participants who, despite dealing
with their own ill health, have been unswerving in their
support of each other and of us.  We would also wish to
pause for a moment to remember those we have lost and
those who are too unwell to participate any further.
(Pause)
We would also like to Thank you, Sir Brian,
Ms Richards, Ms Fraser Butlin, Ms Scott and Mr Hill, and
all the other members of the legal team at the Inquiry,
the Inquiry secretariat and the engagement team, and
everyone who has worked on the Inquiry.  Our Core
Participants wish to convey to you how much they feel
valued, respected and heard. 
    83The process of this Inquiry has been cathartic for
some at least and we have witnessed the creation of
strong and enduring friendships.  We very much hope that
the collective solidarity and the bonds created during
this Inquiry will continue and we hope that the Inquiry
does what it can to facilitate that process.
We also consider, sir, that your positivity and tone
and energy has set the tone which has led to the
excellent rapport between all of those involved in the
Inquiry, which has been the hallmark of the past four
and a half years.
Who do we represent?  We make these submissions on
behalf of 297 Core Participants and the Hepatitis C
Trust.  We represent clients who received blood
transfusions, who have bleeding disorders such as
haemophilia or von Willebrand's disease.  We have
clients who have genetic conditions, such as sickle cell
or thalassaemia, and who require regular blood
transfusions as part of their treatment.
The majority of our clients received blood as part
and parcel of one-off medical treatment.  They received
blood for different reasons.  Maybe they were having
dental treatment or a minor car accident or maybe
surgery for a knee replacement but by far the largest
number received blood in the field of obstetrics and 
    84gynaecology, usually after giving birth.  Sir, at
annexe 6 of our submissions, we provide a pie chart that
looks at the breakdown of the areas in which our Core
Participants contracted their infections.
All of our Core Participants were given the chance
to contribute to submissions and naturally their
responses reflect a wide range of views and different
priorities.  We have sought, as far as possible, to
reflect those views but we have not been able to include
them all or necessarily present everything that they
wanted to say but we very much hope that we captured the
essence for you.
There is, after all, more that unites the experience
of those who are infected and affected than divides
them.  All have suffered a lack of respect.
At the core of the infected blood tragedy was a lack
of respect for all patients, a lack of respect for
individuals with their own values, preferences and the
right to have information to make informed choices about
their own care and treatment.  The right to decide what
happened to them and to their bodies and to their lives
was simply taken away and it is that removal of autonomy
which has been so shattering for many of our Core
Participants.
We tried to speak, therefore, in our submissions on                
     85behalf of those who contracted transfusion transmitted
infections in a myriad of ways.  This Inquiry recognised
at the start of the process the need for an inclusive
rather than divisive spirit and we are confident that
you, sir, will keep the spirit at the forefront of your
mind when you prepare your report.
As I said earlier on, we will be addressing some key
themes.  The three key themes of these submissions are
disempowerment, dismissiveness and defensiveness.  We
suggest, sir, that the evidence that you hear can be
examined through this prism.  First, our clients were
disempowered by clinicians acting on behalf of the state
who deprived them of their autonomy and who took away
their right to choose what happened to their body.  We
submit that this was a gross breach of trust and medical
ethics; second, their experiences were dismissed and
disparaged or seen as a merely unfortunate tragedy; and,
third, our clients' concerns and questions have been met
with defensiveness from those who caused and contributed
to the infected blood scandal.
This defensiveness has been a consistent theme which
has stretched throughout the Inquiry, even to the
closing submissions by Government Departments and state
bodies, and it begs the question whether the Government
is culturally capable of behaving in a transparent and 
    86candid manner.
In summary, we submit that the entire system for the
administration of healthcare, from GPs to the Secretary
of State for Health failed the infected and affected.
We say that these failures were caused by a number
of factors, the most important of which, we submit, were
the failure of the state to have an adequate system of
what we will call haemovigilance, which is the safe
management of blood use in the healthcare system; the
lack of any adequate oversight or audit of clinical
practice, despite the Government having ultimate moral
legal and democratic accountability for the running of
the Health Service; and the state's failure to take
possibility for the problems in the system or even admit
that they existed.  We emphasise what others have said
to you, sir: that this was an avoidable tragedy.
Sir Brian, your report cannot change what happened
in the past but it can stop this happening again.  Your
report can recognise the systemic failures in the way
that the NHS was run, that allowed our Core Participants
to be infected.  Your report can recognise the state's
failings persisted in relation to the treatment of and
the financial support for those infected and your report
can recognise the refusal by the Government to act in
a candid and transparent manner. 
    87What we have sought to do in our written closing
submissions is to set out a series of recommendations
which we would ask you to consider as we believe they
could make a practical difference now to all patients.
We set them out in detail in writing and so I shall
not be going through all of them here.  But I would like
to highlight the recommendations that we hope would: 
(a) improve the way that blood is given in hospital
settings today -- a number of basic failings identified
during this Inquiry are still happening which we suggest
means that a scandal like this could happen again; 
(b) to improve the organisation of blood management
so that the system works together and has adequate audit
and oversight; 
(c) ensure those who were infected through blood
transfusion, transplant or blood products receive care
that meets their needs, which is holistic, patient
centred and comprehensive in meeting physical and
psychological needs; 
(d) improve or create better accountability within
central government for the organisations for which it is
ultimately responsible and to try to change the culture
of that organisation from a defensive culture to
a culture that embraces honesty and openness; 
Finally, provide a comprehensive system of financial 
    88compensation to infected and affected individuals.
Sir, before turning to our issues, having heard and
read the submissions of Government and NHSBT, we believe
it is vital that we emphasise that these submissions are
not simply made with the benefit of hindsight.
The DHSC, NHSBT and other bodies identified that the
documentary record is incomplete and that, with the
passage of time, events are quite naturally
reconstructed rather than remembered, and both of those
points are true.  However, the first and most obvious
point to make in reply is that, had these matters been
investigated adequately at the time and had a Public
Inquiry been undertaken when first requested in the late
1980s, then there would be far fewer of these problems.
One cannot criticise an Inquiry for being unable to
recover information if it has not been permitted to do
its job at the time when that information might have
been more bountiful.
Second, the fact that the record is at times maybe
difficult to follow doesn't mean that it has no value
and we would suggest certainly in comparison to many
other inquiries into matters of the past, there have
still been a considerable number of records that have
come before you during this Inquiry, sir.
Both the DHSC and NHSBT also submit that when we are                
     89using hindsight we are looking at the puzzle as
completed, rather than what it looked like at the start
when the full picture could not be seen.
We have not sought to impose a retroscope.  The
Inquiry, most notably through counsel to the Inquiry's
incredibly helpful and detailed presentations, have
amassed a vast body of contemporaneous evidence and
guidelines that demonstrate that the risks of infected
blood were well known and identified from in or around
1946 onwards.
We recognise that seeking to reconstruct thoughts,
views and ideas from the documentary record does have
some limits.  However, that does not mean that the
information does not have any value, only that it is
maybe subject to caveats, and we ally ourselves with the
submissions of Collins that gesting(?) is not
an articulation of a set of bright-line principles which
have to be followed, but simply an examination of how
one judge might go about assessing evidence in any
particular case.
Sir Brian, there is no doubt in the minds of our
Core Participants that you are definitely more than
capable of being able to assess the evidence before your
Inquiry.
A public inquiry is not always about seeking to 
    90reconstruct the past through the eyes of the past but it
is about examining and judging through the eyes of today
what happened in the past in order to avoid the same
mistakes happening again.  Whilst, sir, you may wish to
grant a little benevolent latitude to those in the past,
it can only go so far and cannot act as an amnesty to
avoid saying some things were wrong or should not have
happened.
Then, on that note, I will move to issue (1), which
was to look at what went wrong, what continues to go
wrong.
We start by making some overarching remarks on the
broad cultural and systematic issues that pervade the
infected blood tragedy and, we submit, continue today.
You will remember, Sir Brian, the difference of
opinion between the public health and administration
experts, Lord Bichard and Professor Pollock, on whether
what was required in government and the public health
administration was cultural, systematic or structural
change; and in a sense we submit that the precise word
doesn't really matter.  What they agreed on
unequivocally was the need for fundamental and wholesale
change in the way that the government operates the
national health system and, in particular, its systems
of accountability. 
    91This Inquiry is in a unique position, having
surveyed the system of governance of the health service
and public health over a period of decades, right up
until the present day, to make recommendations for
cultural and systematic change.  The failures in this
case cannot be and should not be seen as somehow unique
to this particular inquiry.
We see similar failings highlighted in other
inquiries and we would say that the failures happened
because of the way in which the state managed and still
manages health care in the United Kingdom.
The government has created a fragmented system of
health care, with overlapping organisations,
institutions and personnel, none of whom seemed to
consider that patient safety was necessarily the or even
a primary consideration.
There was neither accountability nor oversight by
the government of what was happening within the health
system.  Because of this there were no sufficient
systems in place to ensure an adequate response when
a virus like HIV presented itself, and there were no
systems in place to minimise the risks of what we now
know as hepatitis C.  And we also say there was
insufficient attention paid to the continuing risk of
hepatitis B transmission. 
    92There was a failure to ensure that clinicians on the
ground were aware of the risks of transmission of
infection through blood and blood products; and the fact
that they were not, we say, was a profound failing of
education and information sharing.
Part of this was because of the radical level of
under-resourcing of the NHS which continues to this day
and which we say impacts upon the decisions made.
We suggest that the state has failed to recognise
the culpability inherent in the way the system for the
provision of health care was both designed and operated
during the period in question.  Instead of examining how
the system could be improved, the government spent
political capital and the past 40 years seeking to
defend its decisions.  We say it still does so.  No
lessons have been learnt and its continued defensiveness
can be seen most sharply in the wholly inadequate
response provided by the Department of Health and Social
Care.
For our clients, the continuing inability or refusal
of the government to identify and address what happened
makes it even more necessary for you, Sir Brian, to
recommend the cultural changes we and others suggest,
which includes recommending a statutory duty of candour.
We say that the failure of government, in particular                
     93the Department of Health, to acknowledge their failures
in their submissions is deeply disappointing and even
insulting.  The DHSC's response should be compared to
that of the Scottish government.
I am sure those listening last week will have
acknowledged and appreciated the approach taken by the
Scottish government in their oral submissions.  There
was a degree of pragmatism and openness which was
distinctly lacking from the oral submissions heard on
behalf of DHSC on 18 January, whose wilful and continued
determination to respond to the Core Participant
experience with defensiveness has led to
a disappointingly familiar inertia.
The DHSC failed to clarify the basis for the apology
given at the opening of the Inquiry.  The DHSC has
failed to accept that things went wrong and failed to
demonstrate that lessons have been learnt.
The approach that the DHSC has taken in its
submissions show that now, even after four and a half
years of this Inquiry process, those responsible for
making decisions centrally do not think that they got
anything wrong.
Their view is fundamentally flawed as it fails to
recognise their responsibility for this scandal and the
suffering of thousands of people; a responsibility which 
    94incorporates political and ethical duties, not just
legal duties.
The DHSC, we submit, seeks to blame others without
recognising that had an adequate set of structures and
practices been in place, this tragedy might not have
occurred.  The evasiveness and dishonesty which has
characterised the public line taken by those in power
for the past 40 years must stop.  We have seen and heard
evidence that demonstrates that lines to take were held
even in the face of clear evidence that they were
unsustainable.  One example was the line taken about HCV
testing which started in September 1991.  The line to
take was that testing had been implemented as soon as it
was possible, and that was a line that was trotted out
to the public, the media and even to Parliament, and
that line was held even after evidence to the contrary
was produced, even after the judgment of Justice Burton
in A and Others  in which the judge held that routine
screening ought to have been introduced by 1 March 1990.
Another example of holding the line to take was the
refusal to open a public inquiry because there had been
no wrongdoing and all the documents had been disclosed.
We would submit, sir, that evidence before this
Inquiry, which we will not go to now, makes it clear
that such a line was at best misleading and at worst 
    95a deliberate cover up of the truth.
Alongside this we consider that there are still
continuing failures throughout the health system which
this Inquiry highlights: blood is still used needlessly;
guidance is still not followed and implemented despite
it being widely disseminated; records are still being
lost, they're not kept properly, or they're fragmented
and difficult to access between institutions.
These were problems seen from the 1960s onwards.
They still exist.  And nothing demonstrates the failure
to learn than the fact that these issues are still
present in 2023.
And the sobering reality is that should another
non-screenable virus appear in the domestic population,
there is a palpable risk that a similar tragedy could
occur.  It is the primary duty of government to
safeguard its population.  Within the health care
context, that responsibility rests finally with the
Secretaries of State for Health, who, as Lord Fowler
accepted, have a duty to ensure safe treatment as far as
possible.  Alongside others, they must take the
responsibility for failures in patient safety.
As I have indicated, it is our submission that
responses of DHSC and institutions which they oversee
show that they are still unable to recognise their 
    96wrongdoing.
We believe that there has been lack of parliamentary
oversight and a lack of any attempt to accept
accountability and provide redress.  This Inquiry shines
a light on what we say is a significant gap in
accountability, and it is a gap that allows no one to
take responsibility, and it is a gap that this Inquiry
is uniquely placed to make recommendations to fill.
It is all too easy for politicians to blame civil
servants, for civil servants to blame other civil
servants, and for nothing to actually change.  We fear
that tinkering round the edges will just enable further
failures to take place.  Wholesale change is needed.
If one were to read all of the reports dealing with
health care scandals or scandals involving public
authority behaviour over the past 20 years, one could
see the same things emerging time and again.
Mr Snowden KC took us to a quote from the Hillsborough
report, but similar words could be extracted from many
other inquiries and reports.  For example, we note the
following description used by the Right Reverend
James Jones in his forward to his report regarding the
Gosport War Memorial Hospital.
Lawrence, if we can look at RLIT0001992_009.  Thank
you.                
     97"This Report is a vindication of their tenacious
refusal to be dismissed.  It shows how they were failed
by the professional bodies and by others in authority
charged with responsibility for regulating the practice
of professionals in the interests of patient safety."
"... when relatives complained about the safety of
patients and the appropriateness of their care, they
were consistently let down by those in authority -- both
individuals and institutions ... All failed to act in
ways that would have better protected patients and
relatives, whose interests some subordinated to the
reputation of the hospital and the professions
involved."
As in that scandal and many others, we would suggest
that the government failings in the infected blood
scandal can be characterised as: a failure to listen to
the voices of those affected by the tragedy; secondly,
the closing of ranks and putting the reputation of
an organisation above that of individuals; a refusal to
be frank, what participants to this Inquiry have called
candour; and a defensiveness when challenged.
Turning to the NHS we submit that the NHS, from its
very foundation, has perpetuated a system which has not
respected patients' rights, including their rights to
dignity, autonomy and to make their own choices.  It has 
    98adopted an approach that "doctor knows best".  This
paternalism led to life-altering decisions being made
without patients' informed consent.  It also led to
an approach to risk which ignored what was most
important to individual patients.  And we suggest that
at least in part this patronising approach to the
provision of medicine arose from the lack of oversight
from local, regional or national bodies, a view that
they could not interfere in decisions made by doctors
even if those decisions were catastrophically stupid and
harmful.
It seems to us that the deference shown to
clinicians created a system in which those clinicians
could do no wrong.  And when things did go wrong,
clinicians and those responsible closed ranks, they
denied and put the interests of the system above the
interests of the patients who were being harmed.
In 2020, the Baroness Cumberlege review, First Do No
Harm, was published.  The purpose of the review was to
make recommendations for improving the health care
system's ability to respond where concerns had been
raised about the safety of particular clinical
interventions.
If we can look, please, at WITN7328002_004.
This, sir, is taken from the Baroness' letter to the 
    99Secretary of State.  We are looking at the top
paragraph, when she is describing the health care
system:
"We have found that the health care system ... is
disjointed, siloed, unresponsive and defensive.  It does
not adequately recognise that patients are its
raison d'être.  It has failed to listen to their
concerns and when, belatedly, it has decided to act it
has too often moved glacially."
We suggest that the Infected Blood Inquiry yet again
shows how patients' concerns and complaints were
dismissed and seen as moaning or neurosis.  That
patients, often female patients in particular, are seen
as people to whom things are done, rather than as active
participants in their own treatment and care.
Another reason why things went wrong, we submit, is
because of discrimination within the health care system.
It is vital that -- we consider it is vital for the
Inquiry to recognise the disproportionate burden borne
by our clients, who are women or from minoritised ethnic
communities, who have faced what is now known as
intersectional discrimination at multiple points in
their history.  They were disproportionately likely to
have been infected with hepatitis C or B in the first
place.  Thereafter, they faced further discrimination 
   100demonstrated by the delay the majority suffered in
obtaining a diagnosis and the misogyny or racism they
experienced when they were trying to secure treatment or
even just to be heard.
We appreciate that this is not an inquiry into
health care inequalities but the evidence heard
demonstrates that treatment given to women, in
particular during obstetric and gynaecological
procedures often showed a lack of care and disregard for
their autonomy and dignity.
These issues have been referenced and replicated in
every report which has examined how women have been
treated in the medical system in this country over the
last 20 years.
When women sought treatment for their infections the
casual dismissal of their symptoms and the view that
their intractable pain and ill health was just part of
being female reflects the deep ingrained misogyny of
medicine.
There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating
that the same stark picture is appearing in relation to
minoritised ethnic communities and, in particular, women
from those communities.
For those from minoritised ethnic communities, the
stigma of their condition, if they had a blood disorder                
    101like thalassaemia or sickle cell, often made them be
seen as tainted by the eyes of their community,
something set out in the powerful submissions by The
Thalassaemia Society.  The treatment for their blood
disorder caused the infection which then created further
stigma for them, both within their community and within
UK society.
As well as the Inquiry's work looking inward to
stigma in these communities, it must not fall into the
trap of failing to look outwards.  The stigma was
compounded or arguably contributed to by the relative
lack of research or treatment options for these
conditions and the systemic underinvestment and
disregard directed towards these communities.
Sir, we will come back to that point specifically
when we move on to redress.
If we can look, please, at INQY10002500_018, at the
bottom of page 70.  Thank you.
This is from one of the infected/affected who gave
evidence before you, sir, on 30 September '22:
"... why are people not coming forward?  Is it
because of the taboo?  Is it because of the stigma
attached.  And then being from a BAME background, being
from an Asian or minority background where language is
also a barrier, not understanding what's the process, 
   102not understanding the disease, not understanding the
illness, the side effects; there's a lot more barriers
that we are sort of touching on."
As we suggest in our written recommendation, there
needs to be wholesale work undertaken by the Office for
Health Disparities and a detailed exploration of what
has gone so wrong and it is time for discriminatory
treatment to stop, not just for women but for all
minority groups and we would urge this Inquiry to
identify and recognise that what happened to our
Core Participants and others reflects a need for real
change in medical practice and attitude.
In fact, Sir Brian, you may wish to consider
recommending an Inquiry or further such work on health
inequalities.
Even after death, those who have been infected faced
further discrimination.  Ms Gollop KC took you to the
case of her client who was not allowed the funeral that
he wished.  The Health and Safety Executive's 2018
guidance, Managing Infection Risks when Handling the
Deceased is still not properly followed.  We hear of
funeral directors refusing to embalm bodies of those
with infections, refusing to allow family members to
view the body of the loved one who has just passed away.
So we would invite you, sir, to urge the Chief 
   103Coroner or the Health and Safety Executive to remind
those handling the deceased recognise the importance of
the guidance and make it clear that the guidance is
there to be followed.
Sir, we submit that there has been and is radical
underinvestment in the Health Service.  The system has
been the subject of so many structural and
organisational changes that are bewildering and do not
seem to have led to any significant improvements.
The Government, we say, has failed to provide
a long-term investment and strategy and this was
reflected by many doctors who gave evidence to this
Inquiry, as did those who provided expert evidence as
part of the government and public health group.
Sir Brian, we submit that it is the Government that
is ultimately at fault and responsible for all of the
wrongdoing on which we have made submissions.  Its
response to the scandal, both at the time and as the
scale of the crisis became clearer, was pitiful and
inadequate.
So to return to the three Ds we referred to at the
opening: successive Governments' attitude have
disempowered infected and affected people by ignoring
them and leaving them with no or only very basic support
after their lives were shattered; it dismissed calls for 
   104help, for acknowledgement, for an apology and for
a public inquiry; and there is no better way to describe
Governmental attitudes than "defensive".
The Government, or at least the DHSC, cannot even
explain what they are apologising for and we submit
there needs to be urgent system-wide change.  So to
summarise, sir, we suggest that you should reach the
following conclusions about the role of the Government:
and that is:
(1) that blood policy was not given priority within
the Department of Health -- there was little
understanding or focus on the issue despite its
importance;
(2) that the approach of the Department of Health
showed what we would call institutional inertia and the
approach was to do nothing until you had to and then
only do the minimum required;
(3) civil servants and ministers were overly
deferential to clinicians and were not presented with
the underlying information to enable them to be able to
provide effective challenge.  They were only provided
with the consensus opinion and they were not, as we have
seen in relation to the Galbraith report, provided with
outlier information;
(4) disquiet and discomfort by elected politicians                
    105in dealing with issues about homosexuality, sex and
drugs led to delay in implementing effective screening
procedures;
(5) decision-making was based on factually
inaccurate statements or matters which only told some of
the story -- the decision-making was marked by what we
have heard referred to as "groupthink" and by the
acceptance of a received wisdom;
(6) there was a churn of ministers thus not allowing
for expeditious or consistent decision-making; and
(7) when challenged, ranks were closed and there was
no self reflection or candour, there was the stubborn
refusal to hold a public Inquiry, no one questioned or
queried the lines to take over a 40-year period and the
government failed to create or consider creating
a proper system of oversight, audit or accountability
for the actions of what happened in hospitals, which
would have enabled the Department of Health and
ministers to know or realise the failures that we
outlined earlier.
We say that there was no proper system of guidance
or regulation by the Department of Health.
The seven Nolan principles of public life,
particularly openness and transparency, were utterly
absent when it came to the Government's response to the 
   106infected blood scandal.
Other reports, such as the Mid Staffordshire NHS
Foundation Trust Public Inquiry emphasised the need for
leadership which recognises the reality of the care that
is being provided to patients.
There was inadequate leadership on the issue of
infected blood throughout the health system, including
within central Government, and these failures we
identify were ultimately failures of moral, political
and administrative leadership by politicians and civil
servants.
We suggest that part of this problem is due to
limited Civil Service accountability.  If we can have,
please, LDAY0000002_002.
Sir, this is an Institute for Government report of
March 2020 and this part just sets out what the report
is about.  As we can read:
"The Civil Service is central to government in the
UK.  But it lacks a clear identity, defined
responsibilities and a system of oversight and
accountability.  This report proposes a new statutory
role for the Civil Service to reflect its permanence,
values, objectives and how it should be run and held to
account."
Sir, we suggest that the concerns raised in this 
   107report reflect the problems that we have heard about and
we have seen through the course of this Inquiry, that
are systemic and inherent to the system.  Sir, we
suggest that, if you haven't already, although I am sure
you have, if you haven't already read this report, you
might find it illuminating.
The issues which we identified in Government are so
severe that our recommendations run to 10 pages and we
don't intend to list all of those here, not least
because I don't think my voice would be up to it, but we
would seek to emphasise the following of particular
significance:
(1) a statutory duty of candour for all public
servants;
(2) the regular review of long-standing lines to
take -- sir, you will recall Lady Primarolo in her oral
evidence to the Inquiry suggested that this issue could
be remedied by a committee tasked with examination of
the lines to take;
(3) stronger accountability for the Civil Service;
(4) a system for decisions about public inquiries to
be made objectively and independently of the Departments
under question -- again, Lady Primarolo in her evidence
spoke of engaging with the Cabinet Office or another
Department that is not the subject of the allegations as 
   108a separate body, which would then make decisions about
the Inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005;
(5) Patient Safety Commissioners should be appointed
for all of the four nations with a statutory basis and
a duty to co-operate;
(6) better co-operation between the devolved nations
using the public health framework and health security
common framework; and
Finally, in this issue, our Core Participants
endorse Andy Burnham's view that the nature and extent
of the state's failures require careful consideration by
prosecutorial authorities.
Sir, I will turn now to the second issue, which is
the issue of consent.  We have heard thousands of hours
of discussion about the issue of consent during the
course of this Inquiry but we submit its importance
cannot be overstated.  Those for whom blood or blood
products were not utterly essential were likely not to
have given their consent to them had the life altering
and deadly risks been explained to them.
A huge part of this tragedy would never have
occurred but the Government and other public bodies have
in the past and may yet again seek to argue that, for
a large number of Core Participants, the blood or blood
products they received were life saving and that their                
    109infections were therefore unavoidable.  But, sir, we
would submit this is but a small part of the picture
which does not apply to many of those who were infected.
Even for those for whom treatment was medically
necessary, giving their proper informed consent to
potentially deadly treatment could have fundamentally
altered their life.  It would have allowed them to
monitor for symptoms of viral infections, take steps to
avoid transmission, seek treatment for those symptoms
where possible, make lifestyle changes around diet,
exercise and alcohol that could have saved or prolonged
their life, and for those whose lives could not have
been saved, greater knowledge and information could have
allowed them to live out their last few lives with their
loved ones in the best way they saw fit and to control
their own death in the best way possible.
The medical ethics experts spoke of the concept of
an open future.  Our clients' open futures were taken
away from them because of a system that fundamentally
lacked respect for them as humans worthy of being able
to plan and regulate their way, their lives in a way
they saw fit.
With that in mind, we move on to what went wrong
around the issue of consent.  The overwhelming evidence
before the Inquiry is that, during the relevant period, 
   110doctors did not provide adequate or, in fact, any
information as to the risks of blood or blood products
to allow an informed decision to be made.
This is reflected in the 1998 National Audit of the
Royal College of Physicians of the clinical blood
transfusion process.
If we can look at NHBT0042240_003.  We just see the
"Aims and Objectives" of the project.  The aims and
objectives are to collect data about actual practice.
If we can move on to _006, please.  If we can go to
the top.  Question 5 "Informed consent".  Sir, the
answer to question 5: 
"No hospitals required informed concept for blood
transfusion."
The themes that emerge from the analysis of our Core
Participants ring true with what we can see here.
Almost none were given any explanation as to the risks
and benefits of transfusion.  It was rare that blood
transfusion as an element of treatment was even
discussed and, even if a consent form was signed, it did
not reflect any explanation of the risks.  On some
occasions, our clients were told that blood transfusions
were safe and, in one case, a Core Participant who was
nervous about being given a top-up of blood after
childbirth, because of the risk of AIDS, was told that 
   111the blood had been treated by gamma rays when they
sought to ask questions to check that the blood was
safe.
Some of our clients were not told that they had had
a blood transfusion, particularly if they had been
unconscious when it was given, and no one seems to have
been given a postoperative leaflet or post-transfusion
information, as the signs or symptoms to be wary about.
In particular, where clients had received blood on
an emergency basis, there is no evidence that the risks
of transfusion had been explained to them
postoperatively.
Ethical principles indicate that information should
be provided after the event and that simply did not
prevail.  These failures were, as you recognise
Sir Brian, devastating for our clients.  We submit that
one cannot suggest that the lack of consent was
something that was clinically acceptable during the time
in question and we would ask the Inquiry to endorse the
conclusions of the medical ethics expert group in
respect of ethical behaviours regarding consent,
including the provision of information and the knowledge
of risks and the need to ensure that a meaningful choice
is made and that the choice is grounded in the patients'
values and desires and not in what the doctor considers 
   112is appropriate for them.
So why was this?  Why were there such problems with
consent?  It seems to us that at the time the risks were
not seen as relevant or important.  For those clients
who had to receive blood regularly, some doctors seem to
be of the view that patients were aware or should
themselves have been aware of the risk of hepatitis.
The evidence from clinicians operating on the ground
throughout the period considered by the Inquiry suggests
that none of them or only a few of them raised the risks
of hepatitis as an issue expressly.  Those who have
given evidence admitted to a paternalistic approach to
information sharing.
It also appears that there was little to no
discussion, particularly in respect of planned or
elective surgery or childbirth, where there might be
a need for blood, nor was there discussion about, if
blood were to be used, what the risks associated were
with a blood transfusion.
Whilst it is understandable that one can't have
discussions about consent during medical emergencies, it
should be possible -- particularly for those who are
giving birth at a later date or if they're having
surgery at a later date, it should have been possible to
have had those discussions and to have discussed the                
    113risks and benefits and the likelihood of a transmission
earlier on in their treatment process.
We submit, as we set out in much detail in our
written submissions that the Inquiry should reach the
conclusion that there was no routine consent sought for
blood transfusion or the administration of blood
products.  Similarly, that there was no explanation of
the risks of transfusion or receiving a blood product,
despite clinicians knowing or despite the fact that
clinicians ought to have known that there were
blood-borne viruses which could have infected patients.
This, we submit, was a breach of ethical standards
on a mass scale.
Looking then to why might there have been
a widespread failure to obtain informed consent.  We
suggest that there was a widespread misunderstanding
amongst medical practitioners at the relevant time of
the importance of and the requirements of informed
consent.
We suggest that this stems from the paternalistic
attitudes not just of one or two practitioners but which
were hallmarks of the medical system.  As the medical
ethics experts explained to the Inquiry, there is
a common theme to many episodes in this Inquiry which is
the lack of information given to patients, the lack of 
   114transparency, openness and a failure to listen.  All of
those have been demonstrated over a long period of time.
Sir, even in 2001 the NICE comparative audit in
respect of blood transfusion -- Lawrence, if we could
have WITN7001061_004 -- if we can just go to the top,
the "Key findings".  The fourth bullet point down.
So, although this is looking at the percentage of
transfused patients who were given consent, if one flips
that, what it demonstrates is that 36 per cent of
patients in 2021 received no verbal or written
information about blood transfusion and were not given
the resource leaflet on blood transfusion.
This lack of consent was not confined to blood
transfusions, as can be seen for those with bleeding
disorders.  There was a lack of explanation and
understanding of the risks of infection through factor
products, which has been set out so powerfully by others
in their submissions.
There was a total absence of discussions or the use
of alternatives.  And we heard counsel to the Inquiry
asking on a number of occasions whether or not any
thought was given to alternative steps rather than just
switching off the tap, revision to cryoprecipitate or
other alternatives, but sadly, no alternatives were
used.  It seems that clinicians were so eager to use the 
   115more convenient wonder drug that they made decisions
about patient safety for them.
Again, we suggest that the problem at its heart were
there doctors felt they knew best or simply had no mind
about what the patients knew or wanted.
We suggest there are a number of reasons why doctors
and nurses did not raise issues of consent on a routine
basis.  First, gaining informed consent takes time.
Those who are constantly on the back foot, always
understaffed and under-resourced will not have time to
spend with patients or to undertake the relevant
professional development to keep up to date with
guidelines and research.
Sir, you might recall the evidence of
Professor Steer, who runs a large maternity service,
when he gave oral evidence to the Inquiry, that the lack
of funding meant that money was not spent on providing
training, advice and guidance to junior staff.  He spoke
instead of the charity Baby Lifeline raising money for
the funding and training for obstetricians and
mid-wives.  And something, sir, that Professor Steer
rightly found as perverse.
Our recommendations in relation to consent are set
out in some detail in chapter 3 of our written
submissions, but our view is that the need for cultural 
   116change is significant.  The obligation to obtain
informed consent should be placed on a statutory
footing.  We believe that this can play a role in
creating or even forcing the cultural change that has
not otherwise happened.  We submit that providing
a statutory footing can and does have an impact.
Sir, you will recall Professor Hopkins, the Chief
Medical Officer and transition lead for clinical and
public health at the UK Health Security Agency, gave
evidence to the Inquiry.  
The reference for her transcript -- we don't need to
go to it but just for the transcript and for your note,
sir -- is INQY1000262, and it is internal page 59 of
that document.
During her evidence she was asked questions about
the duty of candour in the health care setting.  And she
explained that clinicians have always had a duty of
candour, as it sets out in the NHS constitution, that
they had always been required if they had detected
something had gone wrong and they were involved in the
care of that patient, that they had to speak to the
patient about what had happened.
Mr Hill asked Professor -- evidence, and I quote:
"... in relation to the duty of candour, your sense
of how things had changed.  Is that a reflection, do you                
    117think, of the fact that the duty of candour became
embedded in statute?  Has that made a difference?"
Professor Hopkins replied:
"... doctors personally have always had a knowledge
of the duty of candour, but they may have felt it
difficult to deliver that within an organisational
capacity, and I think that the statutory effect in
ensuring that organisations had a duty of candour as
well has actually helped that progress forward."
"... I think, the duty of candour has come on and
changed quite a lot over the last years and I think
people are now -- have much more of an expectation of
delivering it than perhaps existed 10 or 15 years ago
prior to the Francis Inquiry."
Sir, you will know that the Francis Inquiry was
a public inquiry into what happened at Mid Staffordshire
hospital and one of Sir Robert's recommendations was the
introduction of a statutory duty of candour.  So that's
what Professor Hopkins was referring to.
In addition, to prevent the disempowerment of
patients and to create a more level playing field, we
also consider that patients should be educated.
Firstly, there should be a consent campaign aimed at
patients, similar to the Choose Wisely campaign referred
to by Dr Murphy, which encourages patients to ask 
   118doctors important questions to avoid unnecessary medical
interventions where they are not supported by evidence.
The campaign should be about shared decision-making.
Secondly, in respect of obstetrics and planned or
elective surgery, we see no reason why a leaflet cannot
be handed out during initial appointments to allow
patients time to read and consider the issues and then
be able to discuss the issues during the later
appointment.
Thirdly, there should be an audit of the giving of
consent and we submit, sir, this would not cost much by
way of time or cost expenditure.  Already, patients
attending for appointments at hospital are provided with
a survey regarding "How was your hospital visit today?"
and it asks about the standard of welcoming and various
different -- it asks about different issues.
It would not take much, we say, to add a tick box to
that form to ask patients whether, where appropriate,
the risks and benefits of the treatment options for the
operation that they are about to go -- whether or not
the risks and benefits had been explained to them and
then these surveys could then be subject to an audit.
Finally, in addition to the existing guidance in the
Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice, there should be
a requirement for medical professionals who make best 
   119interest decisions -- so decisions on behalf of the
patients when the patients are unable to make those
decisions, such as the giving of a blood transfusion
while a patient is unconscious -- that there is
a requirement for those practitioners to disclose those
decisions in full and discuss the risks involved.
Such guidance should stipulate which healthcare
professional is responsible for having these
conversations with patients.  The Royal Colleges, NICE
and other relevant bodies, such as the GMC, should be
requested to amend their guidance in the same terms.
Sir, turning to the third issue of blood products
and self-sufficiency, we deal with this in brief in our
oral submissions.  We set it out in more detail in our
written submissions but we do accept that there are many
other Core Participants who are better placed to assist
you, sir, on this issue.
Our Core Participants who suffer from bleeding
disorders face much of the same mistreatment as those
infected through blood transfusion.  A consistent
picture through their evidence is the paternalistic
attitude of the medical profession, which treated them
with dangerous blood products, without any information
about risks being provided and without ensuring patients
gave informed consent. 
   120Sir, we endorse and echo the submissions made by
other Core Participants groups, in particular Collins
and Saunders Core Participants, as to the failings in
the treatment of those with bleeding disorders.  We
would invite the Inquiry to find that the medical
profession knew or could readily have known about the
risks associated with blood products, especially
imported commercial blood products, from the early to
mid-1970s; that the UK was unnecessarily dependent on
less safe commercial blood products due to
underinvestment in domestic capacity and failure to
anticipate growing demand for such products; and that
the Government and medical profession wholly failed to
resist the aggressive marketing by the pharmaceutical
industry.
Sir, we say there was robust evidence from the 1960s
which grew through the 1970s as to the risks of blood
borne infections posed by blood products.  Sir, many of
the Core Participants we represent who were infected
through blood products have mild or moderate bleeding
disorders.  They could have been treated adequately with
alternative techniques.  At a minimum, the choice
between treatments should have been theirs; the risks of
the products should have been explained.  Our clients
were infected through blood products which were given to                
    121them wholly unnecessarily, including in cases where they
had satisfactorily managed their haemophilia without
such products.  Blood products were prescribed for minor
medical issues, such as bruising or manageable nose
bleeds, as well as on a precautionary basis.
This attitude both caused and compounded the
problems.  First and foremost, it led directly to
avoidable fatal infections but it also significantly
increased demand for the factor products, to the extent
that the UK's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency could
not keep up.  Had the doctors warned of the risks,
especially of imported products, patients might well
have opted for an alternative treatment, which could
have included no treatment at all.  This would have
reduced the demand for factor product and we submit
could have made self-sufficiency achievable.
Finally, on this point, sir, it is important to mark
the UKHCDO's serious failures in this context.  Despite
being a voluntary and unincorporated association it was
the leading body responsible for advice and information
to haemophilia clinicians in the UK.
The advice it provided, especially under the
leadership of Professor Bloom, was inaccurate and
dangerously misleading, in particular in response to the
outbreak of AIDS.  The UKHCDO wholly failed to campaign 
   122for necessary preventative measures.  It was uniquely
placed to provide specialist advice to clinicians and to
the Government about the appropriate response to the
AIDS crisis but, instead, it led them into inaction.
The UKHCDO's advice to The Haemophilia Society led it,
in turn, to give false and dangerous information to its
members.
Sir, the recommendations that we set out in detail
in our written submissions include the recommendation to
invite relevant pharmaceutical companies to publicly
acknowledge and apologise for their conduct, and for the
Inquiry to invite the Government to consider whether to
seek compensation from those companies.
Sir, I note the time.  Not least because I have just
seen you look at your watch but, in terms of our
submissions, this would actually be a convenient place
to break because that's the end of my three submissions.
Then I will hand over to my colleague, Beatrice Morgan,
who will discuss the next two issues: haemovigilance and
treatment.  Then depending on the feelings in the room
either I will return afterwards to cover redress or
tomorrow morning.
Sir, if now is a convenient time to break.

--Result #873--
   This embraces provision of education and advice
needed to achieve that level of safety and the audit of
clinical practice against best practice guidelines.
An effective haemovigilance system involves
a process of learning when problems are identified,
resulting in modifications to policies, standards and
guidelines, as well as improvements to processes and
blood services.  For example, measures to improve the
ultimate safety of blood, such as testing or donor
exclusion.                
    125While the blood services are plainly the best
equipped to coordinate this system there are many other
relevant stakeholders: the Government, other NHS bodies,
regulators and professional societies.
Whilst we note the submissions made on behalf of
NHSBT about the current haemovigilance system, we
suggest that there are further improvements that can be
made but this will however require improvements from
other than the NHSBT, a whole systems approach is
required.
We suggest key failures in the system, both during
the relevant time period and to the present day, are
poor information sharing, inadequate education of
clinicians and the siloed nature of clinical practice.
I will turn to these failures first and will then
consider issues relating to blood management.
We submit that the evidence before this Inquiry has
demonstrated that very many blood transfusions and the
provision of blood products was based upon folk wisdom
about the need for such treatment, rather than on
clinical justification.
Women were given postpartum transfusions in order to
get them up and out of bed, rather than being provided
with iron tablets or just another day's rest.  Surgery
was undertaken with excessive use of blood.  Blood 
   126products were administered for those with bleeding
disorders, even when the risk of excessive bleeding was
extremely small and alternative treatment would have
been effective.
This folk wisdom is perhaps reflected most clearly
in the two not one mantra, that if you are going to give
one pint of blood you might as well give two, which, on
the evidence, was a mantra held by clinicians who
administered blood, irrespective of their speciality.
There was no clinical basis for this.  In fact, even the
early guidelines warned that blood or blood components
should only be given when the benefit outweighed the
risk.  What this shows is that the culture of
an institution and received wisdom can carry more weight
than the guidelines sitting by the side of the doctor's
desk and, as such, is exceptionally difficult to
eradicate.  For our Core Participants, this led to
unnecessary and inappropriate blood transfusion, which
then led to a life-changing infection.
Professor Steer spoke of the widespread
misunderstanding among obstetricians about the standard
medical threshold for anaemia in pregnant women.
Despite extensive evidence that women in pregnancy will
always have a lower level of haemoglobin, which did not
necessarily need to be rectified by a blood transfusion, 
   127the relevant research studies have not been translated
into on-the-ground practice.
A number of our clients received transfusions in
this context and it is, we say, reasonable to infer that
this failure to properly educate clinicians in relation
to relevant research was at least in part to blame.  It
is our understanding that this is an issue which
continues to the current day and, indeed, the evidence
before you, sir, supports that.
To give another example, Professor Mark Bellamy, the
Chair of the Serious Hazards of Transfusion Steering
Group gave a further example of modern day malpractice
when he spoke of doctors sneakily prescribing two units
of blood to bring a patient up to a normal blood count.
He explained that this was unnecessary but that the
doctor thought they were doing the right thing by
correcting the numbers.  He went on to say that, and
I quote:
"Part of the problem, of course, is that each new
generation of doctors who come through seem to believe
the same misconceptions that the last lot believed that
you have just about beaten out of them."
We suggest that, in practice, the NHS is still not
abiding by the principle which has been in place since
transfusion became common after the Second World War, 
   128that the safest blood is the blood not given.  There
were guidelines and guidance on the provision of
transfusions which were published from 1958 onwards, but
it would seem that they were ignored, ignored because
often only the haematologist had copies and there were
no hospital guidelines about them and no education about
them or ignored because they were known about but just
were not used.
We would suggest that this is not clinical freedom
but the continuation of deeply flawed medical practice
which has not been corrected or changed.  Not only were
guidelines ignored or not adequately reinforced but when
innovations were suggested or promoted which would
involve fewer blood transfusions, such as using red cell
concentrates and introducing the surgical use of
tranexamic acid, these were not supported.
The 2021 NHSBT audit, which Ms Jones referred to
earlier, of the NICE quality standards in patient blood
management found widespread non-compliance with these
alternatives.
Lawrence, could we bring up the first document.
It's RLIT0001824.  If we go to electronic page 4,
please.
As is shown here on the right-hand side, the first
two paragraphs, this audit found that only 59 per cent                
    129of patients who are known to have iron deficiency
anaemia were treated with iron before surgery, and
67.5 per cent of eligible surgical patients were given
tranexamic acid whilst potentially all were eligible.
It is not clear from this document whether the
patients who did not receive iron or tranexamic acid
required a blood transfusion.  However, we suggest that
it is concerning, particularly in 2021, that these
precautionary steps to avoid transfusion are not being
taken.  This shows this is not just a problem of the
past.
Sir Brian, we suggest that this demonstrates how
deeply embedded practices can prevent appropriate
medical care irrespective of guidance.  In this case we
see a fierce resistance to change not predicated upon
advice but on what has always been done.  This is
a dysfunctional culture in action.
Part of these failures must be ascribed to medical
practitioners who are responsible for the management of
blood banks.  These were haematologists who had often
trained or worked in a regional transfusion centre.
They were responsible for good blood management.  They
would receive requests from doctors on the ward for
blood and blood components, and had the opportunity to
question these requests with a view to ensuring 
   130compliance with guidance, for example by asking for
details of the reason the patient needed a transfusion
and whether alternative treatment had been given or at
least considered.  However, as we have heard, this was
rarely done and these questions rarely asked.
The evidence presented to this Inquiry on balance
seems to suggest that they or their team were either not
able to discuss these issues with the practitioners
administering the blood on the ward or in operating
theatres, or they considered that such a discussion was
not required or was inappropriate in some way.
As we have identified, in order to create a safe
system, all parts of that system have to work
effectively.  Very few individuals were given any
training on safe blood use during their medical
education, despite administration of blood being
a regular occurrence in many specialities.
We submit that there was a failure by the NBTS to
provide education to doctors and hospitals on safer
blood practices.  It should have been the body which did
so.  It seemed to view itself as such, as it published
the Notes On  -- and, later, the Handbook of --
Transfusion .  But these documents were not promoted nor
was there any oversight of whether the handbook was
being complied with. 
   131Many of those who administered blood transfusions
and gave evidence to this Inquiry frankly admitted that
they had never seen it.  If the Handbook of Transfusion
was not going to be used, it is not clear to us why it
was being produced.
Those at the NBTS and many of the regional
transfusion directors undoubtedly had real expertise and
wanted to convey the importance of limited blood usage.
After all, this was set out in the Handbook of
Transfusion Medicine .
The NHS -- BTS's submissions do accept that their
role included advising on education and audit of
transfusion practice.  But their approach in reality, as
they accept themselves, was largely focused upon supply
and not distribution.
The NHS -- BTS accepts that it only had limited
resources available during the relevant period to focus
upon teaching transfusion practice.  Each Regional
Transfusion Centre had its own approach to training and
professional development.  For example,
Professor Contreras spoke of regular meetings with
hospital staff and training for junior doctors in
North London.  However, there was no systematic, unified
or common approach which sought to provide education as
the centrepiece, as an essential cornerstone to safe 
   132blood transfusion safety.
The evidence shows that the production of guidelines
is not sufficient to overcome folk wisdom or habitual
clinical practice.  A culture change is required.  We
suggest there should be proper research, as
Dame Sally Davies identified in her oral evidence to
you, as to how to effect behavioural change within the
NHS.  We agree with Core Participant Andrew Bragg, who
made oral submissions to this Inquiry two weeks ago,
that the NHS is not a learning organisation; we need to
turn it into one.
Part of this will include behavioural change.  In
our submission, this would include: (a) enhancing the
effect of good practice within the weight of the law;
(b) ensuring consistent, adequate, high quality
training; and (c) incentivising practitioners by
demonstrating how good practice benefits their patients.
The impact of poor information sharing and siloed
clinical practice went both ways, and in relation to
some issues it was the NBTS that was in the dark.  For
example, the Regional Transfusion Centre clinicians who
gave evidence have been frank in identifying that they
seriously underestimated the risks of transmission of
hepatitis.
There is, we suggest, no excuse for this.  The                
    133evidence shows that textbooks which were standard for
those operating in blood transfusion medicine had
identified the risks since the early 1960s.  By the
mid-1970s it was well known that non-A, non-B hepatitis
could cause chronic illness and cirrhosis.  Those
treating people with non-A, non-B hepatitis were aware
of the risks but there does not seem to have been any
routine input by those specialists into the NBTS, nor
was there routine reporting of incidents of transmission
of non-A, non-B hepatitis to the blood services.
This then played in to the limited information given
to government and to the clinicians working on the
ground in other specialisms.
The failure of NBTS to heed this knowledge was
significant given the role it played in terms of
influencing other clinical fields, public bodies and the
government in relation to blood transfusion practice.
This resulted in failures to make a meaningful
contribution to research and data gathering about the
emerging risk of non-A, non-B hepatitis, meaning that
there was and remains a dearth in the epidemiological
understanding of the scale and nature of the problem.
Crucially, the failure by NBTS and the individual
Regional Transfusion Directors to pay attention to and
to seek out the latest research on non-A, non-B 
   134hepatitis and other blood-borne viruses resulted in the
failure to implement additional measures to mitigate the
transmission of this virus.
Turning to the blood management systems.  In
addition to poor clinical blood transfusion practice, we
suggest that there was a failure to create and ensure
that there was a system of effective blood management
within the NHS during the relevant period.
We submit that the collection, processing and
provision of blood was not as safe as it could have
been.  There was insufficient monitoring or audit of how
that blood was used, who it went to and why and no real
system for reporting when HIV, HBV or HCV was
transmitted.
The Regional Transfusion Centres were run as
independent fiefdoms, answerable to their own Regional
Health Authorities, with differing practices and
policies.  They were in reality 14 quasi-independent
regional centres and two central laboratories, without
any central coordinating body that had any authority.
It meant that blood supply was not necessarily
shared across regions and led to a system which did not
allow for economies of scale.  We submit that it was
considerably more difficult and time consuming as
a result to implement patient safety measures and 
   135uniform practice across the country.  For example, the
North London Centre had expert knowledge on AIDS and
donor exclusion, yet this was not shared or applied
across other centres with sufficient speed.  We agree
with the submissions of the Collins' Core Participants
that best practice from leading centres could and should
have been disseminated and shared.
We suggest that the NBTS failed to operate
a surveillance system and adequate record keeping
procedures to cover the entire blood transfusion chain.
Neither did it have adequate systems for the monitoring,
reporting, investigation or analysis of adverse events
relating to blood transfusion.
We submit that the failings in the system were known
about at the time and are not just clear with the
benefit of hindsight.  For example, the Department of
Health commissioned a report in 1982 which identified
serious deficiencies in the control and the movement of
blood.  In the 1984 Health Circular issued to Regional
and District Health Authorities stated that records kept
at RTCs, hospital blood banks and at ward level must
permit the tracing of any unit of blood from collection
to transfusion or disposal.
However, the evidence before this Inquiry shows that
this did not happen within the relevant period or at 
   136least not with any consistency.
It was known at the time that the system was
incomplete and that it was not possible to identify how
blood was used by whom and when.  There was no routine
data or audit of transfusion practice in hospitals.  As
was suggested to this Inquiry, had a proper system been
in place in the 1970s and 1980s, the NHS and the NBTS
would have realised that there are significant
infections being caused and there was near total
non-compliance with the guidance on transfusion.
The Inquiry's presentation on hospital transfusion
committees sets out that it was only in 1989 or 1990
that NBTS and Government Health Departments suggested
these committees were required.
However, it only seems to have been from 1998
onwards that committees were present in most hospitals
and, even then, the implementation of their guidance was
patchy.  Hospital transfusion committees became
an important structure to achieve better blood
management by way of education, clinical advice and
audit of practice.  Dr Thomas explained how easy it was
to change the two not one mantra practice in hospital,
once the hospital transfusion committee was formed.
This was because it carried out an audit function and
thus, as he said, "It was quite easy to identify the                
    137ones that were repeat offenders, if you like, you then
focus on those individuals and see if you can persuade
them to change their practice".
However, even before the committees were set up
there was no reason why other strategies could not have
been introduced on a widespread basis.  For example,
a blood ordering schedule, which could have given
hospital blood banks some oversight of the volume of
blood being ordered, by which clinicians and when, and
could have enabled the identification of excessive blood
use.  This seems such a simple idea.
As I set out earlier, the failure to use fundamental
and nationally accepted guidance in the majority of
hospital settings led to the widespread misuse of blood.
However, this was allowed to continue unchecked as
a result of the failure to operate audits, which would
have identified and could have addressed these issues.
There was no leadership for transfusions in hospitals
before the mid-1990s.  There is no reason why hospital
transfusion committees could not have been set up
earlier and there are very many reasons why they should
have been.
On a national scale, it was only in the late 1990s
that there was a better blood transfusion campaign.  The
implementation of a national committee to advise on 
   138blood transfusion and a centralised body in place whose
role was the collection and distribution of blood in the
UK as a whole.  Before this, there was no such system.
We suggest that there has not been any satisfactory
explanation by clinicians or others of why it took until
the late 1990s for the implementation of this system,
rather than it coming into force at the inception of the
NBTS or soon thereafter.
We submit that this delay reflects an approach to
blood collection that encouraged, through the mechanisms
of funding and resourcing, the development of
a fragmented system, operating in silos without a joined
up vision or approach.
Part of having a haemovigilance system is having
effective records to enable tracing and auditing.  There
was a wholly incomplete record keeping system, which
meant that it was not possible to effectively trace
donations once these had left the Regional Transfusion
Centre and were in the hands of hospital blood banks.
Thus, there was not and could not be a harmonised
system to investigate post-transfusion infections.
To describe record keeping in hospitals as "woeful"
would be an understatement.  We submit there are the
following major failings in the system.  First, the
Regional Transfusion Centres had no responsibility for 
   139oversight or audit of the records kept by hospitals.
Records of blood transfusions at hospitals were not
systematically made.  Even if a record was made it did
not always include the batch or serial number of the
blood transfused.
Dr Murphy described a 1994 audit at St Bartholomew's
hospital which examined ward practice, both on the day
of transfusion and one day post-transfusion.  The audit
found that nearly 30 per cent of the transfusions given,
there was no documentation in the patient's notes.
Where a reference to the transfusion was documented,
this was usually just a brief note, such as "Transfuse
four units of blood tomorrow".
Next, where there was a record of the transfusion,
there was frequently no reason given for why the
transfusion had been required.  This meant that audit
against best practice could not occur, for example to
determine if blood was being over ordered or overused by
any particular clinician team or speciality.
If kept, the records were typically destroyed six to
eight years after treatment, in accordance with the
relevant record retention policy.  We now know that this
period is insufficient for a disease which may only
present itself decades later.  Those drafting the record
retention policies failed to recognise that records may 
   140need to be examined far into the future for research or
because of latent ill health.
Hospital record keeping systems were disorganised
and there were often multiple paper record files kept
for one patient.  This meant that information may be in
three or four different places.  They were often lost
when hospitals merged, which has occurred frequently
over the past 30 years, or through digitisation, and
some records were sanitised by doctors when it became
easier for a patient to access information about their
treatment and therefore to read what their clinicians
had written about them.
The pruning of a patient's notes to that which was
essential may have increased the likelihood of blood
transfusion related records being lost or discarded, as
they may often not have been set out in the main
clinical notes but on anaesthetic sheets or fluid
balance charts, for example.  In short, the way in which
the system was designed did not encourage accurate
recording or ensure retention of documentary evidence of
a patient's transfusion.  This seems inexplicable, given
the importance of traceability if things were to go
wrong.
There was clear guidance to Trusts about creation of
effective records within a hospital blood bank, which                
    141were set out in the Notes on Transfusion Medicine  and in
a 1984 report produced by the British Committee for
Standardisation in Haematology.  This guidance was
routinely ignored or breached.
We would stress that many of our Core Participants
are strongly of the view that destruction of their
records was deliberate and as part of a conspiracy or
cover up.  This belief has been fuelled by the lack of
candour which our clients have experienced over decades.
The perception of deliberate destruction acts as yet
another strain on the fractured trust that many Core
Participants and their families have in medical
practitioners and has had a lasting impact on their
confidence in NHS services.
Some may say that these problems are in the past but
both Professor Bellamy and James Neuberger identified
that, even now, blood transfusion is not part of
an electronic patient record, it is usually recorded on
paper which, in theory, gets scanned onto the system at
some point.  This does not give us or our clients much
confidence that this is a system with rigour.
The nature of NHS record keeping systems leaves most
individuals searching for records that are more than
10 years old in a state of utter confusion.  Copy
records are often out to them with key notes missing. 
   142Sometimes the missing pages, despite relating to the
same patient, are found in a different box or at
a different storage location.  Often, key records are
never located and excuses are made, frequently without
providing a full explanation of where these important
and highly sensitive documents might have gone.
Those requesting their records in order to prove
they had a blood transfusion have been shocked to find
no reference to it in both the clinical notes, in
discharge summaries or in correspondence with their GP.
The Inquiry has heard evidence regarding the reasons
certain parts of a patient record may be lost or
destroyed, as I referred to a moment ago.  However, such
explanations were not given to our Core Participants
who, when they questioned the absence of these
documents, were usually met with a shrugging of
shoulders by those working at the relevant NHS Trust.
We know that the NHS recognise that record keeping
is a problem and has done so for many years.  What we
don't understand is why it has been so difficult to do
anything about it.  What is most egregious to us,
however, is that, despite all of this being well known
and understood by those working in NHS services and by
civil servants, the trusts and schemes set up to provide
financial redress require documentary proof that 
   143an individual had received a blood transfusion before
payment could be made.
This was proof that they knew a significant number
of applicants with valid claims would not be able to
produce.  We would suggest that to construct a system of
payments dependent on production of proof which cannot
be provided for reasons beyond the control of the
individual is Kafkaesque in its design.
Our written submissions propose a number of
recommendations on the issues I have raised this
afternoon.  I will summarise a few of these here.  The
evidence before the Inquiry, as I have said, is that
there is still not an adequate system for haemovigilance
in the UK and that safe use of blood is often still not
seen as a priority.
The most recent iteration of better blood
transfusion is Transfusion 2024, a five-year plan for
clinical and laboratory transfusion practice in England.
WITN7001031, page 5, please.  Then if you could
highlight paragraph 3.5, from the National Comparative
Audit Programme.
As we can see, this is a review article about
Transfusion 2024.  It refers to data provided by the
National Comparative Audit Programme, highlighting that
approximately 25 per cent of blood and components are 
   144still used inappropriately.  This article was published
in 2021.
The Transfusion 2024 five-year plan sets out four
key areas for further action.  Lawrence, could you do
a split screen of the second and third electronic pages.
These are outlined here.  I won't go through all of
them.  I believe that they are detailed in the NHSBT
submissions.
We support the actions proposed.  However, we are
concerned that they will not go far enough to address
the inadequacies in the haemovigilance system.  For
example, in his evidence, Dr Murphy identified that
there is no one body responsible for leadership of safe
blood transfusion practice.  He explained that, as set
out in this document, the recommendations of
Transfusion 2024 fall to many different groups,
including the National Blood Transfusion Committee --
and you can see this on the -- where it says "Key
responsibility of other stakeholders" next to each
action.
So the bodies include the National Blood Transfusion
Committee, NHSBT, NHS England and Improvement, Health
Education England, Institute of Biomedical Sciences,
British Blood Transfusion Society, National School of
Healthcare Science, the Royal Colleges, and individual                
    145NHS trusts.  And there are others.
However, it is not clear who or which body is
overseeing the implementation of measures to improve
transfusion practice as a whole.  We suggest that this
is the continuation of a fragmented system and does not
do enough to ensure the joined up approach required.
We are concerned that the plan states that the
implementation of the actions in relation to the
information technology -- and, Lawrence, that's just on
the second of these pages, under C -- state that these
actions will be subject to agreement on the solution and
funding.
We would suggest that the failure by successive
governments to fund NBTS on a national basis and to
provide it with an adequate budget for its research
projects acted as a barrier to making change quickly.
The proposal of these actions is meaningless if the
funding to put them into practice cannot be found.  If
we are going to adopt the precautionary principle in
recognition of the fact that the use of blood is
inherently risky, then we have to make it a priority.
In our submission, NHSBT should be the body with
lead responsibility in terms of education and advice.
We welcome the actions set out in the Transfusion 2024
plan, particularly that to strengthen scientific and 
   146technical education and training.  However, we note that
this education is limited to laboratory training.  There
is no action to implement education of clinicians more
widely.
We recommend that NHSBT should have a statutory
function to promote the appropriate use of blood and
that this should be extended to explicitly embrace
informed consent.
We have set out in some detail in our --
recommendations in our written submissions for
improvement of the system.  They include ensuring that
NICE guidelines are adhered to and that steps should be
taken to ensure minimal risks of transmission, adopting
the precautionary principle you have heard about in
written and oral evidence.
We have spoken about the failures in recordkeeping
and make detailed recommendations throughout chapter 5
of our written submissions about this issue.  We
particularly stress the need to prioritise the
development and roll-out of a digital patient record.
Significant opportunities for patient involvement and
interaction with this digital record should be grasped
and explored with a particular view to improving the
quality of the patient consent process.
This would also assist doctors in fulfilling the 
   147subjective element of their duty of care set out in the
case of Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board.
Could we get that last document back up again?  We
support the proposal of vein-to-vein electronic tracking
that is set out in the Transfusion 2024 action as one of
the information technology actions.  
It's just on the next page.  C.2, just one up from
the bottom.
As can be seen it is described as:
"... a plan to drive the implementation of
vein to vein electronic systems from donation, recipient
group and screen sample, blood collection,
administration of blood and monitoring of transfused
patients."
However, we do note that this is one of the actions
that, as you can see there states, will be subject to
agreement on the solution and funding.
We consider that secondary care records should be
kept for longer than eight years after the last
treatment.  A failure to retain records could lead to
vital missed opportunities to join up the dots in
patient symptoms which occurred for our Core
Participants who have had or have viral hepatitis.
Further, or alternatively, there should be a process
by which a patient is notified and given a chance to 
   148request a digital or paper copy of their records in the
event that a hospital trust intends to destroy them.
GP records should include a flag that a patient has
had or is suspected of having had a blood transfusion.
We suggest that a targeted infected blood record task
force should be created to address the issues mentioned,
and also to locate historic records of blood
transfusions and add them to patient records.  It would
be of value to our Core Participants and others whose
records of a transfusion are missing both because of the
trusts' and schemes' approach to documentary evidence
currently and because of the likelihood that
an individual will be at an advantage in respect of any
future compensation scheme if they do have records of
their transfusion.
It would also have a cathartic function for patients
whose doctors did not believe that their hepatitis was
caused by a transfusion-transmitted infection and who
have faced the trauma of finding out that there was
a gap in their records with regards to transfusion
history.
Particular attention should be paid to examining
hospital blood bank records for this missing information
and correlating it with patient records.  This task
force should also identify as far as possible where                
    149records have been destroyed and by whom, when and for
what purpose or in what circumstances.  The infected and
affected deserve for information than they have been
given to date.
Turning now to donor exclusion and testing.  In
addition to failures in information sharing and blood
management systems, there were failures in the
implementation of safety measures at the point of
donation, namely testing and donor exclusion policies.
The responsibility for the unnecessary delays in
implementation of testing does not lie with one single
agency and, again, are, in part, as a result of
a fragmented system.  The NBTS did not act swiftly.  The
Chief Medical Officer relied upon the information
provided by the NBTS and did not seek to expedite the
process.  The Civil Service and the ministers did what
the Chief Medical Officer told them.  There was no
critical friend available to challenge or demand that
steps were taken more quickly.
We have identified the following themes in the
decision-making of the NBTS around testing technologies.
Firstly, the NBTS and some Regional Transfusion
Centres in particular were affected by a lack of
funding, meaning that they sought to delay the costs
inherent in putting in place the necessary 
   150infrastructure to roll out testing, for example
counselling for positive or potentially positive donors.
As confirmed by Professor Contreras, there was
an attitude of maximum benefit for minimal cost.
Second, the NBTS made decisions about testing, based
on an insufficient epidemiological picture of the
prevalence of blood-borne viruses in question.  As we
have already submitted, this was substantially
contributed to by the NBTS's own failures to implement
a system of education and information sharing.
Third, between 1983 and 1984, the nature and
seriousness of HIV was underestimated.  Similarly, the
underestimation of the chronic and serious nature of
non-A, non-B hepatitis persisted until testing was
introduced and, indeed, continued afterwards.
Finally, the NBTS system was overstretched and
inefficient.  It lacked a focus on economical use of
blood on patient safety purposes and instead was
concentrated on providing enough blood and blood
components to meet the needs of the NHS and enough
plasma to meet its targets for fractionation.  Decisions
about testing were made in the context of regional
transfusion directors' ongoing concern about inadequate
supply.
We acknowledge the evidence of multiple regional 
   151transfusion directors that the most important factor in
delaying the introduction of HIV and HCV testing
technology was the fallibility of early generation
testing and the absence of effective confirmatory
testing.
These directors emphasise the ethical ramifications
of causing unnecessary distress to the donor if they
gave a false positive result.  For both HIV and HCV
testing, however, we submit that improved technology was
very much on the horizon, at the points where the early
technology was fallible and/or its early trial phase.
In other words, if an early test had given a positive
result donors would only have needed to be deferred for
a short period before improved and/or confirmatory
testing could corroborate, or not, the first result.
The reasonable ethical concerns could have been
dealt with in a way that respected both donors' and
recipients' interests by ensuring that deferred donors
were carefully and sensitively advised of the reason of
their deferral and reassured by the offer of further
and/or more effective testing as soon as it became
available.
In any event, when it came to testing, we submit
that the incorrect balance was struck.  The assessment
should have been weighted heavily towards patient 
   152safety, the protection of lives and the reduction of
chronic illness and, indeed, on an economic level,
long-term savings for the NHS by minimising infection.
We submit that routine screening for HCV should have
been introduced by the 1 March 1990.  This was what
Mr Justice Burton found in 2001 in his judgment in the
case of A and Others v NBA .  We note that in their
written submissions, NHSBT accepted that testing should
have been introduced by July 1991 but not earlier.  This
goes behind the judgment in A v NBA and, as you
identified in your questions to Mr Cory-Wright last week
sir, it is a later date than was conceded by counsel for
the NBA in that matter, based on the evidence before
him.
That hearing and the gathering of evidence for it
took place much closer to the events in question than
NHSBT's submission for this Inquiry and we would urge
you, sir, to reject their position on this point and to
find, as Mr Justice Burton did, that routine testing for
HCV should have been introduced by March 1990.
The continual refusal of those involved to accept
this date and to argue that their actions are
justifiable demonstrates, we would submit, the wilful
blindness which we suggest has characterised the
approach of the NHS and the state to this issue.  Even                
    153when screening for HCV was introduced, blood that was
already in the system, that which had been processed
prior to 1 September 1991, was not tested.  This means
that untested blood that may have been contaminated by
HCV was included in the supplies held by hospitals for
a considerable length of time after the introduction of
testing.
We submit that this undermines the rationale for the
introduction of the cut-off date of 1 September 1991,
for eligibility for the various trusts and schemes.
This is our particular concern for some of our
clients and we would ask you, Sir Brian, to find that
the cut-off date was artificially imposed, without any
rational basis.  This was evidenced by Richard Gutowski,
the civil servant responsible for overseeing the
creation of the Skipton Fund.
We ask you, sir, to recommend the extension of the
current schemes to include those who can demonstrate
that their infection was caused by a blood transfusion
given after 1991.  You are aware that one of our Core
Participants, Ms Challis, is in this position and that
we brought a judicial review on her behalf challenging
the legality of the cut-off date.
In Mrs Justice Steyn's judgment in this matter, she
left the decision to you, sir, whether to recommend 
   154an alteration of the current schemes as they operate
and/or to recommend that any future compensation scheme
is set up without imposing the cut-off date, as part of
the eligibility criteria.  We ask you to do so.
In relation to testing to hepatitis B or HBV, we
submit that the Inquiry has heard limited evidence in
relation to the reliability of testing for HBV during
the period in question.  In December 1972, the UK
introduced screening of blood for HBV surface antigen,
at least ten of our Core Participants received blood
transfusions or blood products after 1972 which caused
them to be infected with HBV.  This was, we submit,
a direct result of the fallibility of the early
screening tests.
It was well known throughout the 1970s and the 1980s
that there was a significant risk of transfusion
transmitted HBV infection.  It was recognised in the
mid-1970s that the tests will identify only around
50 per cent of HBV carriers.  Whilst testing technology
improved over time there was still cases of transmission
by transfusion in the early 1990s.  Despite this, the
Department of Health Advisory Committee decided in 1993
that anti-HBc testing which the research showed would
reduce the transmission of HBV could not be justified.
It was only in the early 2000s that a more sensitive 
   155PCR test was introduced.  We submit that there was
a failure by NBTS to keep up to date with the
developments in tests and to ensure that the most
sensitive tests available were employed.
On this basis, we consider that the current
financial assistance schemes should be adapted to
include those infected with HBV and they should be
included in any future compensation scheme.
Sir Robert Francis excluded HBV from his recommended
framework for compensation because his impression was
that generally its effects were mild.  However, this
Inquiry has heard from clinicians treating those with
HBV and, most importantly, those infected with HBV who
have so powerfully given evidence.  We suggest you have
heard much more than Sir Francis on this issue, which
may result in you reaching a different conclusion.
In our submission, there are a number of other
safety measures beyond testing and, crucially, in the
absence of routine testing that were available to the
NBTS in order to reduce the risk of infectious donations
entering the system.  We consider that donor selection
and donor exclusion measures used by the NBTS were
inadequate in screening out high risk donors who may
have been infected, thus leading to avoidable
infections. 
   156In summary, the exclusion criteria were insufficient
in highlighting the risk factors for AIDS and,
therefore, donors who should refer.  We fully endorse
the position of Professor Richard Tedder that the donor
exclusion for AIDS during the relevant period should
have, from the inception of the leaflets, excluded all
men who have or who had ever had sex with men, as well
as their sexual contacts.
The criteria should have excluded anyone who had
ever injected drugs at any time.  Instead, the language
and criteria used was purposefully vague and was overly
cautious.  It is reasonable to infer that it would have
led to some donors who should have self-excluded
continuing in good faith to give blood.
Secondly, the evidence before the Inquiry
demonstrates that Regional Transfusion Centres were too
reticent in the way that they promoted this donor
exclusion information and managed the process of donor
deferral.  For example, many Regional Transfusion
Centres were reluctant to send the AIDS donor
information leaflet to their donors with calling cards
and, instead, chose to have the leaflet merely available
at donation sessions.  These often took place in
workplaces and other large industrial settings, where it
was unlikely that individuals would have wished to                
    157reveal private or personal information.
With the exception of a minority of centres, notably
North London, most were not in favour of too close
questioning of donors as to their sexual activity, out
of concern that it might be counterproductive.  The
evidence, however, shows that these fears were
unfounded.  To the contrary, parallel work engaging with
the gay community could lead to the understanding and
support of the communities the NBTS were seeking to
exclude or defer.  Professor Tedder described this as
a meaningful and useful interrelationship and exchange
of views and advice, bilateral advice on how to find the
best way forwards.
Crucially, as though with ministerial responsibility
for these leaflets accepted, notably Lords Fowler,
Clarke and Glenarthur, their publication was improperly
delayed.  This delay appears more starkly when
contrasted with the Scottish approach.
Turning now to our fifth issue, our fifth key theme,
diagnosis and treatment for those infected.
Our Core Participants, having been infected with
blood-borne viruses then had this harm compounded by
a litany of further failures from the medical system in
terms of their diagnosis, care and treatment.  Many
persist to the present day.  We urge the Inquiry to 
   158recommend action to address these inadequacies.  We
submit that it can be reasonably inferred that countless
victims of infected blood were never diagnosed and died
without knowing or are still out there undiagnosed.
These patients were lost to the system.  We submit that
not nearly enough has been done proactively to try to
find them.
For many of our Core Participants who are not
frequently subject to tests or assessment by specialist
clinicians, and so were reliant upon primary care to
identify possible HBV and HCV infections, there were
often very long periods of time between their symptoms
being recognised and their infection being diagnosed.
We have set out in our written submissions,
annexes 5 and 6 if you wish to look, the period between
infection and diagnosis, which was for most at least
five years and, in some cases, was well over 30.  Had
they been provided with adequate information about the
risks of transmission they may well have recognised the
signs of hepatitis or been able to discuss this with
their GPs or others earlier, recognising that this may
have come from the blood transfusion.  They could have
been tested in as early as 1991, when routine screening
became available, and could have adopted lifestyle
changes to mitigate the long-term damage to their 
   159health.  Instead, they spent years and sometimes decades
with a wide variety of severe symptoms but without
diagnosis and therefore without appropriate treatment.
We set out again in the annexes of our written
submissions, 2 and 3 this time, the symptoms described
by our Core Participants in their witness statements.
The Inquiry has heard extensive and distressing  evidence
of these symptoms, and I don't propose to list these out
or put them on screen, unless it would be helpful for me
to do so.  Suffice to say they are wide-ranging and have
been debilitating for our clients.
We submit that the failures in treatment and care
and support were a result of a system that failed to
listen to its patients, making assumptions about their
symptoms based on prejudiced stereotypes, and was
woefully under-resourced in terms of information about
the infected blood scandal, blood-borne viruses, their
symptoms, prognoses and the available treatment options.
Steps were taken to carry out a look-back exercise.
However, this was inadequate.  Principally the look-back
took far too long to be set up and its success was
doomed because of earlier recordkeeping failures.
Moreover, and once again, potentially infected 
recipients were not prioritised or treated as autonomous
individuals, with clinicians giving a kind of 
   160therapeutic exception option to not inform them that
they had likely received blood.
It took many of our clients until this century or
even the past decade to receive a diagnosis.  Whilst
those currently in charge of the NHS England Hepatitis C
team, in terms of the elimination ambitions, seem to
think otherwise, we suggest that it is still the case
that there are many people who have been infected with
hepatitis C via a blood transfusion who have not yet
been diagnosed.
Samantha May, who has been involved with running The
Hepatitis C Trust helpline for over 20 years, and who we
suggest has almost unrivaled understanding, identifies
that this is still an issue.
Between 2019 and 2023 some 110 people who contacted
The Hepatitis C Trust helpline had received a recent
diagnosis of HCV where the only identifiable risk factor
was blood transfusion.  Since the beginning of January
this year she has received calls from three newly
diagnosed individuals who were infected via blood
transfusions over 31 years ago.  She has also informed
us that, as a rough estimate, she receives two calls per
month of people recently diagnosed with HCV where the
only risk factor is a transfusion.
Whilst it is an diminishing issue, it is vitally                
    161important that those who may still require treatment are
urged to come forward.  Unlike in other countries there
has never been a drive in the UK for the general public
or those of a certain age to be tested for HCV.  We
suggest that this should have happened and should still
take place.
We submit that the evidence of those who sought
treatment and diagnosis highlights the following
concerns with practice and procedure within the NHS,
which we suggest is still the case: ignorance on behalf
of the primary care providers about the risk of HBV and
HCV to individuals who have no history of drug use and
do not come from a high risk country.  This leads to
a reticence or an outright refusal to refer the patient
for viral hepatitis testing.  This lack of knowledge has
prevented effective testing and treatment and still
continues today.  There are dozens of examples before
the Inquiry of people, often women, being told that they
don't need a test on the basis that they don't fall into
one of the high risk groups.
Even when blood tests returned abnormal liver
function results, referrals for testing were not made.
There were assumptions made, assumptions which even at
the time did not fit the presentation of the patient.
Instead, the abnormal results should have been 
   162investigated.
The ignorance of primary care providers and their
lack of understanding about infected blood and
blood-borne viruses led in some cases to a diagnosis not
being communicated because the GP did not feel able to
provide appropriate information.  The lack of education
and training of GPs about these issues created a blind
spot in terms of diagnosis, treatment and care.
The way that diagnosis was communicated was often
very poor and was delivered with a notable lack of
detailed information about prognosis and treatment
options.  A diagnosis was often communicated in
a heavy handed and frightening manner, with very little
emotional or, indeed, practical support.  Often
diagnoses were given without explanation or
understanding of the sensitivities that should come with
communicating a stigmatised disease.  For example, the
news was delivered by letter or telephone call out of
the blue and without nuanced and sensitive discussion.
Almost all of our Core Participants have said that
they were not given sufficient information to manage
their conditions or to understand the risk to others.
Almost none were given information about useful support
groups or information that they could access.
These failures cannot simply be ascribed to a lack 
   163of scientific knowledge.  They were as a result of poor
communication skills and ignorance due to a lack of
education and training.  We would submit that if GPs did
not feel confident about discussing these issues with
their patients, referrals should have been made to those
who could have explained these matters clearly and with
sensitivity.
A feature of the poor treatment and care our Core
Participants have experienced is stigma, even at the
hands of the medical system and practitioners
themselves.  Many of our Core Participants suffered
a general lack of compassion and dignity, with their
viral status being announced or disclosed inadvertently
or not in a non-private setting, such as a ward or
waiting room.  Many of our Core Participants report
their confidentiality and dignity being compromised by
visible skull and cross bone stickers on their medical
notes or other non-discreet means of identifying that
they were an infection risk.  Similarly, many report
being deprioritised for treatment, often put to the end
of an operation list or being refused treatment
altogether because of their viral status.  This appears
to have been particularly common among dentists.  This
was wrong.
Hepatitis expert Dr Jeffrey confirmed that standard 
   164precautions for hygiene and safety in hospitals should
apply for those with hepatitis and HIV apart from rare
and specific scenarios such as in a renal dialysis
setting.
Some of our Core Participants state in evidence that
they were told they were "lucky" to receive treatment
for viral hepatitis.  This is, we suggest,
a stigmatising approach to treatment, singling out
a patient group as somehow unworthy of treatment that
has been properly allocated to them.
We submit that many of our female Core Participants,
on top of being patronised and belittled when giving
birth were then patronised and belittled when they
presented with symptoms.  Whilst this Inquiry is not
about gender discrimination, it reveals the widespread
and systematic discrimination in the provision of
medical treatment to women.  Furthermore, and as touched
upon by Ms Gollop, clients with bleeding disorders or
HIV or hepatitis C were encouraged not to have children,
to be sterilised, and were seen as tainted if they were
carriers.
Given that a significant number of our clients were
given blood during obstetric and gynaecological
treatment, we draw your attention in particular, sir, to
recommendations that we make in chapter 8 of our written                
    165submissions in relation to gender equality.
Could we put these on screen, Lawrence.
SUVS00000059, and it's pages 432 and 433.
So it's, yeah, the recommendations from there, and
then it carries on to the blue text at the top there.
The first ever Women's Health Strategy for England was
published by the Department of Health and Social Care in
August 2022.  Dame Lesley Regan, a distinguished
obstetrician, is now the Women's Ambassador for Health
Care.  We would ask that you, sir, make the
recommendations to her that can be seen on the screen.
As you can see, these recommendations relate to
blood transfusion practice, women's experience of
patronising care, disparities in treatment for HCV, HBV
and HIV and training of clinicians on the bias and the
diagnosis and treatment of women's health.
Thank you.
Turning to treatments particularly for hepatitis C,
we do not need to reiterate in any detail the horror of
the first stage treatments for HCV.  It is sufficient to
recall that Emma Prescott, specialist thalassaemia and
hepatitis C nurse, described interferon as the worse
drug she has ever had to give to patients.
Again, whilst we recognise the enthusiasm for any
form of treatment, we suggest that the horrendous side 
   166effects and relatively poor success rates should have
led to more conversations about the benefits of this
treatment which the evidence of clinicians has
recognised was not always had.
Many of our Core Participants experienced
a significant delay in receiving the new direct acting
antivirals.  This only changed in 2017 when the drugs
became funded via NHS England and a central
commissioning service.  We suggest that, again, there
were failures of communication between doctors and their
patients about why they were or were not eligible under
a system of rationing.  No consideration appears to have
been given to prioritising those with infected blood
and/or explaining why they would not be so prioritised.
We would also identify that there would need to be
a monitoring of side effects on an individual patient
and on a national scale.
We would ask you, sir, to identify that the current
services for follow up and monitoring after treatment
for HCV, where there has been a sustained virological
response, is patchy.  There is no consistent clinical
practice and many of our patients have no clinical
surveillance at all.  We make recommendations for
systemic and consistent follow up.
We recognise that resources are precious and scarce. 
   167However, these recommendations made in light of the
experiences of our Core Participants over many years and
their quite reasonable concerns, which are palpable and
understandable, about the damage HCV may have caused to
their body and their increased risks of end stage liver
disease.  We also submit there is clinical evidence to
suggest such is warranted.  This was amply explored by
multiple experts, as is set out in our written
submissions.  We do not intend to repeat this evidence
today.
We submit, therefore, that all those who contracted
HCV through infected blood should receive regular
monitoring and screening, as frequently as possible, to
mitigate their continued risks of developing cirrhosis
and liver cancer.
To the extent required, a bespoke policy should be
in place that reflects the historic wrongdoing and
failures to diagnose victims of infected blood over
decades and the heightened risks and anxiety they
therefore face.  Our recommendations on these issues are
based on what the hepatitis expert group said all
patients were entitled to expect as best practice.
Moreover, it would be likely to save costs overall.
There is evidence from our Core Participants of
patients falling outside the system after successful or 
   168failed treatment, particularly with early interferon
treatment.  There should be a conscious effort to recall
such patients as they may have cirrhosis or be at risk
of liver cancer, therefore they may still be clinically
entitled to newer treatments, monitoring or indeed other
services, such as palliative care.
There should be a conscious effort -- I'm sorry.
Another overriding theme from our Core Participants'
evidence is the failure of their treating medical
practitioners to provide care and treatment for all the
manifestations of their HCV, pre or post-treatment, in
a joined up way.
The experience of most of our Core Participants is
that clinicians who are not HCV specialists are not even
aware of basic information about HCV, nor the latest
research around its various extra hepatic manifestations
and its nature as a multi-system disorder.
We consider that a model of care, specifically for
people with HCV is necessary, which ensures joined up
care and continuity of support.
This should be managed on a multidisciplinary basis,
which embraces the patient's entire physical and
psychosocial need.  This multidisciplinary model would
benefit both patients and doctors, in the sense that it
would allow medical professionals to make more                
    169collaborative, patient-driven, supported in evidence
based decisions.  It would also allow for
cross-fertilisation of knowledge, including between
specialities.  While we submit this is good practice in
medicine generally, it is all the more vital for our
clients, because of the multi-systemic nature of their
conditions and the tendency for them to fall through the
cracks of the system, or have their multiple conditions
and treatment inappropriately coordinated.
This was a manner of delivering care that was
praised by multiple expert clinicians throughout this
Inquiry.  In our written submissions, we make detailed
recommendations for the implementation of regional HCV
hubs and integrated care, facilitated by specialist HCV
nurses.  This is a crucial part of the redress those
infected are entitled today and is essential for
rebuilding their trust in the NHS.
We suggest that none of this is more than good
practice would expect in any event.  This approach will,
in fact, save time, money and NHS resources.  It will
avoid the siloed care which is time consuming for
patients and inefficient use of clinicians' time and
treatment pathways which are inappropriate for a
multi-system disease.
As well as support for physical symptoms, we submit 
   170there is a significant need for specialist psychological
support.  There has been a paucity of such support to
date.
The woeful attitude of NHS England to the provision
of specialist psychological support as part of the
Trusts' schemes was explored in the November hearings
but did not fill our Core Participants with optimism
that, absent a clear steer from you, Sir Brian, anything
would happen.
There has been no dedicated service for those
infected with HCV by blood transfusion and their
families.  By contrast, the Inquiry has heard and
received evidence of HIV and haemophilia-specific
services.  The limited services of some of our Core
Participants received through the trusts and schemes
were inappropriate, inadequate in the length of
treatment and not tailored to the impact of infected
blood.
The justification for such a service has emerged
from a vast range of evidence to the Inquiry, including
the evidence and recommendations of the psychosocial
expert group and the fact that HCV itself can cause
mental health disorders.  We therefore suggest that it
is essential that ongoing treatment for our Core
Participants includes psychological input for those who 
   171want it.  This should be offered as a matter of routine
upon diagnosis with HCV and HBV as a result of receiving
infected blood or blood products.  This should be funded
and not limited to the usual NHS offer of 12 sessions of
CBT.  It could include the support groups or where
appropriate family therapy, considered on a case-by-case
basis.
Families of those infected should be offered
psychological support, as has been done successfully in
Ireland.  As Samantha May and number of our CPs have
explained in their evidence to the Inquiry,
psychological support should be targeted towards the
needs of this group.  It is essential that professionals
providing psychological support or counselling for this
group understand the history of NHS infected blood and,
therefore, the nature of the trauma, sense of injustice
and lack of trust in the NHS and medical professionals.
We understand there is specialist counselling available
in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland but not in
England.  We recommend centralised commissioning through
NHS England and delivery via the regional hubs.
Treatment for the infections should not be viewed as
the end point of psychological difficulties for those
suffering with HBV or HCV.  Access to HCV support should
not be time limited and should be provided on the basis 
   172of need without unnecessary access hurdles.
In addition to any psychological service, there is
a need for day-to-day support via groups, help and
information phone lines to assist people to manage the
impact with living with the infection.  The Hepatitis C
Trust provides a great deal support for their
information lines, without any form of Government
assistance from present, something which may not be
sustainable in the long-term.  The Inquiry may wish to
consider whether such services should be funded through
an NHS grant.
Patients from minoritised ethnic groups, including
those who have sickle cell disease and thalassaemia,
have faced stigma, inequality in care and discrimination
on the grounds of their race and ethnicity.  They
therefore should be provided with specialist
psychological support that acknowledges and is informed
by the unique obstacles they have faced.
Very few of our Core Participants have received or
are receiving any palliative care at all, a phenomenon
that the palliative care group considered was not
unusual given the low priority this had had within liver
treatment until recently.  We consider that good
palliative care is what those of our Core Participants,
who have advanced liver disease, deserve and require.                
    173We therefore ask you to endorse the conclusions of the
palliative care expert group report and make
recommendations so that palliative care is seen as
standard in the care of advanced liver disease, in the
way that it is in respect of other diseases.
In summary of the issues I have covered, sir, we
consider that the failures which led to the infected
blood scandal were systemic in nature and were created
by every part of the system which provides medical care
to individuals in this country and which pays for and
organises it.  There was a distinct lack of education
about blood-borne viruses but, in particular,
hepatitis B and C during the time in question, their
signs, symptoms and long-term impacts.
But, as we have identified, there were also wider
failures in treating patients with respect and dignity
and being open and candid with them.  Again, there are
some basic changes which should be made.  There is
currently no formal system for making guidelines
available across the entire NHS, nor is there any duty
upon a clinician to understand good practice.
There should be a system for promulgation of
an education in good practice and to keep clinicians up
to date.  Much of the material is still aimed at the
specialists, rather than being set out in bite-sized 
   174chunks for the consumption by the doctor who may need to
know the conclusions, rather than the research biases.
There is still a hierarchical culture which involves
learning by see/do/teach, which, we would suggest,
promotes worst practice, bad habits and the folk wisdom
we talked about earlier.
We therefore make detailed recommendations that
there be a robust overhaul of medical education, in
particular education related to HCV, supported by
a public information contain to increase understanding
and awareness by both doctors and patients which we
refer to at Chapter 5 of our written submissions.
That concludes my part of the submissions, sir.
I note the time.  As we discussed, I think Ms Jones
needs about 30 minutes.

--Result #874--
   Thank you, sir.
Turning now to redress and, to begin with, looking
at financial redress.  Our Core Participants, when they
asked for redress were given either nothing or ex gratia
payments which were too little and too late.  I intend
to focus this morning on future arrangements which
should be made for financial compensation but I wish to
open my remarks regarding the trusts and schemes by
recognising the cruel, humiliating, and insulting way in
which the ex gratia payments have been made to infected
and affected individuals to date.There can be few such striking examples of adding
insult to injury than causing deaths and debilitating
illnesses and then forcing victims to beg for scraps
from the table.  Almost all of those who we represent
have stories of such treatment.  Many were refused
compensation because of the negligence of the
Health Service in failing to record their treatment or
losing their records, others were stigmatised and
disbelieved, being treated as though they were
con artists who had picked up diseases as a result of
their own choices.
Our clients have been excluded from the schemes
because of blood received after the cut-off date of
September '21, even though no one can explain why that
cut-off date was chosen, and they have been excluded
because the infection they contracted didn't have the
right name: it was HBV rather than HCV or HIV.
If the Government wished to create a scheme which
looked as though they were helping out while paying out
as little money as possible, then they achieved their
goal: this begrudging, destitution-level support, which
has also understandably damaged the faith that our
Core Participants have in the Government's commitment to
providing any compensation scheme.
So it is against that backdrop that the futurecompensation scheme must be developed.  It must address
and avoid the failures of previous schemes and it must
provide generous and prompt compensation to those
affected by this tragedy.  And we use the word
"compensation" deliberately, sir, because there has been
serious wrongdoing here.
In relation to the recommendations that we set out
in our written submissions, I would like first to turn
to who should be eligible for compensation.  Like other
Core Participants, we largely welcome Sir Robert's
recommendations.  However, there are a few areas in
which we would urge you, sir, to go further; in
particular, the inclusion of HBV within any compensation
scheme, the removal of the cut-off date of
September '91, as well as the inclusion of natural
clearers.
It is of the utmost importance for our
Core Participants that financial compensation is prompt,
generous, and secure.  The financial support they
receive must continue for the rest of their lives, and
we endorse Sir Robert's suggestion that this should be
formally guaranteed by the Government.  This must also
be reflected in the structure of the future scheme.  It
must have open-ended funding that can meet the needs of
all applicants rather than being ring-fenced.                
      5The £100,000 interim payment already paid to some
should be extended to those not eligible under the
current schemes.  Those who, for instance, are included
by virtue of the cut-off date or infection with HBV
should immediately receive an interim payment.  The
estates of those where there is no bereaved partner
should receive the 100,000.
Further, we strongly endorse Mr Snowden KC's
suggestion that this Inquiry should call for further
interim payments to be made, given the length of time
the creation of any new scheme is likely to take.
The future compensation scheme must be created with
the infected and affected community.  Redress must be
made with them rather than doled out to them without
their involvement.  As we have seen through this
Inquiry, the infected and affected community know their
needs best, and are best able to identify and advocate
for change.  
Whilst we broadly endorse Sir Robert's suggestion of
a tariff-based scheme, we emphasise that this
incorporate proper, individual assessment, especially of
past and future special damages.  The assessment should
be holistic.  Tariffs should be developed in
consultation with the infected and affected community,
who must have a meaningful opportunity to contribute.
--Result #875--
   I agree, sir.  And if you decide to offer ideas
in relation to a future compensation scheme, then we
would support the idea that an applicant, an affected
applicant who has provided the care, should be entitled
to receive financial compensation -- it wouldn't be
compensation -- financial support for the care they have
provided, rather than, as you say, monies being paid to
the infected individual, who then has to pay it out.

--Result #876--
   Yes, sir.  And I would hope that the compensation
scheme that would apply for affected applicants would
include general damages for those types of injuries: the
psychological impact and the stigma, as you suggest,
sir.  And I believe in Sir Robert Francis's report, he
does set out tariffs for stigma and the social impact of
somebody who is infected and affected.  If that is
wrong, sir, I apologise, and I can check that in the
break.

--Result #877--
   We consider that the awarding body for the new
compensation scheme should be an independent
arm's length body with rights of appeal.  A body that
understands the background of the infected blood scandal
and which seeks to be inclusive rather than exclusive.
There should be a reversal of burden of proof or, at
the very least, a lower standard should be applied, by
which I mean a reasonable degree of likelihood, rather
than blood having been received on the balance of
probabilities, and there must be no insistence upon
medical records as a precondition for eligibility.
Our Core Participants also require meaningful
support and non-financial support which should not be
overlooked or deprioritised in the process of creating
a new compensation scheme.  The awarding body should be
aware of applicants' social needs and should be properly
equipped to support applicants to assess comprehensive
welfare services, including housing, income support, and
social care. 
    12We invite the Inquiry to recommend that the UK adopt
a model of free services such as that described by Brian
O'Mahony in his evidence to the Inquiry.  That includes
free dentistry and optometry services; free hearing
tests and hearing-aids; free physiotherapy; free
complementary therapies, including massage, reflexology,
acupuncture and any other appropriate services;
a Government guarantee to insurers, which will allow the
infected and affected individuals to access life,
mortgage and travel insurance on a level playing field
with other customers.
Many of our Core Participants have very substantial
needs for care and support.  We invite the Inquiry to
recommend that infected individuals are provided with
free domiciliary support, and social care services as
needed.
Once again, applications for such a support must be
viewed sympathetically and on their own merits and, in
order to access these services, sir, we urge the Inquiry
to consider the recommending the introduction of a role
such as the liaison officer in Ireland which Mr O'Mahony
referred to as "crucial".
Sir, this is our last chance to make meaningful
redress to the victims of the greatest disaster in NHS
history.  Now is the time at long last to compensate and                
     13support the people who have been rebuffed, excluded and
dismissed for decades.  The Government response must be
swift, generous and unstinting.
The Government's position and failure to issue
a response to the Paymaster General at the very least
threatens a potentially long and drawn-out period whilst
any recommendations that you make, Sir Brian, are
implemented, if, in fact, the Government chooses to
implement them.
Sir Brian, we urge you to make a further interim
recommendation that the Government makes further interim
payments to those infected and affected, including those
who were excluded from the last interim payments.  There
is a very real and palpable fear that it could be years
before the Government finally has a scheme in place.
Our Core Participants fear that this process is
being deliberately drawn out to minimise the
compensation to be paid and that they will be dead
before any money is received.
We would also urge you to recommend that the
Government implementation of your recommendations be
scrutinised and reviewed, either by this Inquiry or by
an independent body, which includes members of the
infected and affected community.
You will be aware, sir, that the Hillsborough 
    14disaster has been in the news again over the past few
days because of the anticipated official police response
to the report of the Right Reverend James Jones.  His
report, The Patronising Disposition of Unaccountable
Power, was a review of the experiences of families
affected by Hillsborough and was published in November
2017.  It set out 25 points of learning relating to the
response of public bodies to state related deaths.
We're now five years on and over five years there
has been no formal response from the Government, which
the Reverend described as "intolerable for the
families".
When asked for comment, the Home Office said that it
was committed to responding to the report as soon as
practicable, and this is five years on.
We would ask you, sir, to urge the Government not to
delay in responding to any recommendations that you
might choose to make.  The infected and affected to this
Inquiry have waited decades for redress and tragically
many have died without it.  They cannot and should not
have to wait any longer.
Sir, another feature of redress is, of course,
a meaningful apology.  Our clients have waited too long
for a recognition of the immense harm and suffering they
have experienced.  Many have died, waiting for 
    15an apology.  Now is the time for a step change from the
state and other agencies that have played a role in this
tragedy.  In our written submissions we invited
apologies not only from Government, including the DHSC,
but also the UKHCDO, The Haemophilia Society and the
pharmaceutical companies.
Sir, you'll recall when we were speaking about
discrimination yesterday, I said that I would come back
to issues in relation to racial discrimination.  Here,
sir, I'd like to address you in relation to particular
redress and action for minoritised ethnic communities
affected by infected blood.
Sir, we have a number of Core Participants who were
infected via their treatment for blood disorders.  These
conditions are likely to require frequent transfusions
with blood components of various kinds.  Given the
significant number of individuals in the UK with sickle
cell, sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, it is likely
that number of these patients would have been infected
with HCV and HIV.  The statistics expert group was
unable to break down the medical reasons for blood
transfusions in those who were infected with HCV or HIV,
other than to identify than more women than men aged
between 20 and 50 required transfusion, and that was
probably because of the use of the treatment, by which 
    16I mean blood transfusion, during maternity care.
In response, sir, to a comment put to Dame Sally
Davies by CTI that blood-borne viruses were not really
on the radar for this group of patients -- by which
I mean patients with bleeding disorders -- she referred
to the context of health inequalities suffered by her
group of patients and the patchy services they received.
We submit that the fact that this condition is
disproportionately suffered by those from a sub-Saharan,
African or Afro-Caribbean ethnic heritage contributed to
and compounded these inequalities, and therefore
contributed to the lack of spotlight or understanding of
the secondary issue of blood-borne viruses, which
statistically, we submit, it can be inferred would have
affected this group disproportionately.
Professor Davies indicated that during her time at
the Middlesex Hospital there was less research being
undertaken into sickle cell anaemia than other forms of
blood cancers or disorders, and she expressed her
concern that this may well have been what she termed as
institutional racism.  She also identified that the
funding for sickle cell patients may have been
influenced by their ethnic background, saying:
"I feared it might be, because if you look at the
money spent on haemophilia patients and the numbers, the                
     17discrepancy was unfair ... I was concerned about the
fairness of it."
And, sir, we can get the reference for that
transcript for you in the break.
The fact that clinicians such as Professor Dame
Sally Davies were focusing on the priority of getting
decent services in place, and as a starting base for
these patients, meant that the issue of blood-borne
viruses was overlooked.  Sir, we consider that a similar
inference can be drawn for patients with thalassaemia,
who are disproportionately people of Mediterranean,
South Asian, South East Asian and Middle Eastern origin.
Sir, we invite the Inquiry to conclude that much
like our female Core Participant cohort, existing health
inequalities, and in this case arising from ethnic and
sociocultural determinants of health, intersected with
the general failings outlined above, leading to
disproportionately worse outcomes for Core Participants
with blood disorders.
The Inquiry has also examined the stigma and shame
that can be associated with HIV, HCV or HBV, and that
there can be a double stigma in some communities.  You
heard powerful evidence of the fact that some choose to
hide their diagnosis for fear of being ostracised by
their communities.  We would ask, sir, that the Inquiry 
    18recognises this.
As we have identified, we consider that this Inquiry
is in a position to make recommendations concerning
health inequalities, in the context of the evidence that
the Inquiry has heard, which could make meaningful
change for the future.
Sir, as you know, there is now an Office for Health
Improvement and Disparities.  One of its roles is to
gather expert evidence and research, and to identify how
to address the issues.  We would ask that the Inquiry
identify to the Office for Health Improvement the
information that the Inquiry has uncovered that poor
treatment and outcomes for conditions such as sickle
cell and thalassaemia may have masked issues around
their infection with HCV, or HIV or HBV.
The Government should recognise that those from
minoritised backgrounds may well have had double
discrimination.  The Office for Health Disparities
should be asked to examine this in respect of viral
hepatitis and HIV and to identify ways to improve their
care and treatment.
Sir, finally, the Inquiry might wish to consider
recommending that the Government should consider
initiating a widespread review and/or a public inquiry
into health inequalities. 
    19Finally, turning to our Core Participants' voices.
We must end these submissions by acknowledging the
immense harm and suffering experienced by all of our
Core Participants as a result of the infected blood
scandal.  Lives have been lost and lives have been
shortened.  Debilitating and extreme pain has been many
of our Core Participants' daily experience.  They have
lost parents, children, siblings and partners.  Whatever
the outcome of this Inquiry, nothing can ever make
amends for such devastation.
One example is the Core Participant we represent who
expressly held consent for her five-year old daughter to
receive a blood transfusion where it was not medically
necessary.  The following day, her daughter's doctor
transfused her without her mother's consent.  When our
Core Participant objected, the doctors laughed at her.
Her daughter developed HCV, from which she died at the
age of 16.  That young woman would have been 36 years
old today.  Her mother has explained there's not enough
words to explain how someone feels when that happens to
them.
Many of our Core Participants described the stigma
of their infection, whether that be HIV, HCV or HBV,
being so acute that they felt "dirty", "ashamed",
"guilty", "unclean", "like a sewer rat", "poisonous", 
    20and "like a leper".
Our Core Participants have been thrust into
a position of living with the constant, unspoken fact of
death hanging over them.  One Core Participant quotes
from their psychologist, who notes:
"[X] lives with the fact that hepatitis C is
a life-threatening virus.  The uncertainty that that
generates has a direct affect on his level of anxiety
and depression.  Also, each time [X] is made aware of
someone who, having been well for a number of years, has
suddenly become ill from the virus and died even, it is
a powerful reminder of the reality of the threat under
which he lives."
Others describe how the only thing that keeps them
going in the face of the fear is not wanting to leave
the planet without being sure that there will be
adequate compensation for their families.
The affected, as you rightly pointed out, sir, have
suffered acute, vicarious trauma.  As one Core
Participant described it: 
"The most difficult thing is watching somebody you
love fall apart day to day.  I can only describe it as
like watching an old car with bits falling off
progressively.  It's like there is a paleness or
a greyness to every day but you must try to keep your                
     21loved one cheerful and keep them going.  All you can do,
if you feel overwhelmed is go out into the nearest field
and shout."
To close, Sir Brian, our clients have found the
process of this Inquiry cathartic.  But the wrongs of
the past 40 years have to be righted.  There must be
swift, meaningful and comprehensive compensation and
unconditional apologies.  There needs to be wholesale
and systemic change in the way that patients are cared
for, and the way that the NHS responds to its own
failures.  It must become compassionate and open.  That
would be the greatest and most important legacy of this
Inquiry and this whole tragic affair.
I wish, as I finish these submissions, to remember
the 11 of our Core Participants who have passed away
during the course of this Inquiry and all those who are
no longer with us.  None of them will be forgotten.
Each of the Core Participants we represent has
a unique story which is uniquely tragic.  As a team, we
have been honoured to represent them.  Further, the way
in which all of those infected and affected have
conducted themselves during this Inquiry has been
humbling.  They've acted with dignity, showing respect
for each other, and they've acted with compassion and
commitment. 
    22Sir, they are not group to be dismissed,
disempowered and defended against.  Instead, they are
a group who deserve accountability, acknowledgement and
action.  Once again, I thank each of them for their
courage and resilience in sharing their stories with us.
Sir Brian, unless I can be of any further
assistance, those are our submissions.

--Result #878--
   Sir, ladies and gentlemen, my name is
Lloyd Williams.  Together with Mr Christian Howells,
Ms Laura Shepherd, and instructed by Watkins & Gunn, we
represent 237 individual Core Participants.
We also represent Haemophilia Wales, Haemophilia
Northern Ireland, Hepatitis B Positive Trust, and CJD
Support Network.
Sir, it's almost four and a half years ago that
I stood up and made our opening remarks.  One point
I made at that time was how difficult it was to make
submissions without hearing any witnesses, not receiving
any statements, or being served without any documents --
without documents.
I rather regret saying that at the time, having
received hundreds of statements, tens of thousands of
documents.  Fortunately, we've had the benefit of
Ms Richards and her team, who have guided us through the
material as it's emerged.  My clients would like to
thank Ms Richards, as I think most of them did when
they'd finished their evidence.
On the morning I made the opening remarks, I was
approached by one of our Core Participants.  She was
upset.  She told me, as she subsequently told you, sir,
in Cardiff, that she'd been infected with hepatitis C
when she received a blood transfusion on the birth of 
    24her child.
She was unaware that she'd received a blood
transfusion, and it was some time later that she became
aware of the transfusion, and that she'd contracted
hepatitis C.  Prior to the birth she was a regular
attendee at a blood transfusion centre.  When she'd
recovered from the childbirth she recommenced providing
blood.
When she was eventually warned that she was
infected, she was told she couldn't give blood anymore.
She was very upset.  She'd been giving blood in the
previous years and she'd given blood in the period
between the birth of her child and the time when she was
eventually warned, some time later, that she'd been
infected.
I mentioned this when I opened our position four and
a half years ago, and I produced her transfusion card.
Well, sir, the world keeps on turning and yesterday
Mrs Elaine Huxley, who is here somewhere today, produced
another document.  This was from Velindre, cancer
hospital, confirming that she's got terminal cancer.
The event confirms, if we need it, the terrible
events that we're dealing with.  The consequences are
not what occurred -- are not just what occurred 10, 15,
20 years ago.  They're the here and now.  And they'll go                
     25on into the future.  It's very important to bear in
mind, we say -- and our Core Participants would say --
that due regard is not just had for those who have
suffered in the past, although that's very, very
important, but that due regard is had to those who
continue to suffer, who continue to be deprived of
fathers, children, and who need care and assistance into
the future.
Sir, we'd like to thank Mr Steven Snowden KC and his
junior, Mr Brian Cummins, for the heavy lifting on many
of the issues that touch upon all our Core Participants.
It makes our task that much easier.
In respect of those submissions made by Mr Snowden,
that you find persuasive, then we join in on those.  Any
of his submissions that you don't like, we don't join
in.
Sir, these submissions will focus on the main issues
with which our clients are concerned.  Many of our
clients have a particular interest in events in
Northern Ireland and Wales, and I think Mr Howells will
be dealing with that in the second half of these
submissions.
We don't intend to cover every topic.  The Inquiry
has an extensive team and detailed knowledge of the
evidence.  As such, we will, for the most part, not 
    26rehearse evidence, save for references to key documents
and excerpts of the oral evidence where necessary.
This Inquiry, it's been said many times, should have
been held decades ago, when events were fresher,
memories sharper, and more key witnesses would have been
able to give evidence.  Importantly, many infected and
affected who are no longer with us, would have been able
to bear witness to this Inquiry and the findings which
you will make.
No adequate explanation has been put forward by any
of the ministers or civil servants as to why this
Inquiry was not held sooner.  The line taken by
Government, that patients received the best treatment
available given the medical knowledge at the time,
became entrenched, notwithstanding that it was wrong.
It was done so at the expense of an open-minded review
of that position, until now.
Before I look at the material that I want to
consider, which will cover future compensation, future
medical support, and past support, I have to say I've
had the thunder taken out of some of my submissions in
view of the ones you've heard just now.  I'll do my
best.
I'd just like to look at and consider the opening
remarks we made, as it sets out, if you like, a test 
    27against which this Inquiry can be measured.  We, in our
opening remarks, identified three issues that our
clients particularly wanted you to address.  The first
one was that they wanted their stories heard.  For 30,
40 years, people have spoken on their behalf or not
spoken on their behalf.  This was the opportunity and we
urged you to allow them the opportunity to tell their
own stories.
Secondly, we raised the issue of they wanted the
truth.  They didn't want the whitewash.  They wanted the
truth from the witnesses.  Whether we've had the truth
remains to be seen.
The third issue they wanted us to raise was justice.
There's a number of elements to justice.  I'll go
through them in one moment.
Put simply, they want their stories heard.  Sir, one
should not underestimate the sheer anger felt by the
victims.  "Victims" was the words we used at the time
and for the moment I'll stick with that word.  Their
feelings are as raw today as they've ever been.  The
victims feel it's important at this stage that the
Inquiry is given the flavour of how their lives have
been destroyed.
There are a number of themes to be considered and we
suggested at that time, sir, that these were the themes: 
    28the initial shock of infection; the ill health
associated with infection, compounded by the ill health
associated with any pre-existing condition; the various
forms of treatment they'd undergone, such as liver
transplants; combined effect of hepatitis C and HIV, to
which we will now add HBV; the stigma attached to those
conditions; ostracism from their friends and their local
communities; the shock of finding out their infection
could have been avoided; the anger, resentment and
bitterness they feel towards those whom they trusted and
were entitled to trust; the financial devastation that
followed infection; the ruined family and private lives
of the victims; the guilt that the victims feel about
potential infection of their loved ones; and the burden
they feel they've brought to their families; and also,
a particularly difficult cohort, the guilt that the
wholly innocent parents feel for not questioning the
treatment that was provided to their children, and in
some cases to which they administered to their own
children.
This not an inquiry simply looking into the past;
it's an inquiry, as we've said four and a half years
ago, looking into the here and now.  Now, four and
a half years later, I can say it's for the future from
here.                
     29Sir, the question arises about the material that
they wanted us to tell you about.  In respect of that,
we referred to two letters which we read to you.  I'm
going to remind you of those letters -- they're going to
become relevant later on as well, but I'm going to
remind those letters I read to you.
The first one said this:
"From our experience the UK Government has been
evasive, dishonest and cynical.  The Department of
Health has been hostile in its responses to campaigners
and MPs who have debated the matter in Parliament.  They
have refused to both fully accept responsibility and to
offer realistic compensation.  They have engaged in
political trickery and treated victims with contempt.
The Department of Health clearly has a lot to hide and
has been aggressive in defence of its own interests.
The financial assistance given has been piecemeal and
grudging, the use of contaminated blood and its
consequences is a scandal but the attitude of the
Department of Health to the victims is an even bigger
scandal, provoking great anger, distress and suffering,
adding insult to injury."
The second letter is this:
"All widows have been given a life sentence, some
a double life sentence if they've been infected as well, 
    30for a crime we did not commit, and we suffer daily from
something we did not do.  We have been there when our
husbands have discovered that they've become HIV
positive and/or hepatitis C positive.  We have watched
our loved ones become ill.  We have often given up our
jobs and careers to nurse and care for them, enduring
hardships in consequence.  We have had to endure the
stigma of those illnesses with them.  We have suffered
harassment and prejudice.  We have often been too
frightened to tell our families about the truth of loved
ones, perhaps lying or keeping secrets.  We have had to
tell our children, if we've been able to have them, that
their father was ill and dying, while others have been
denied the chance of ever having children.  We have
watched our loved ones slip away, hold their hands as
they do, and see them die horrific deaths, bury them and
afterwards try to rebuild our lives with a constant
background of this travesty in our minds, and with
little support.
"Many have been unable to work again.  They have
been traumatised, had breakdowns, been left to become
single parents and bring up children who have been left
without fathers.  A few widows have become homeless and
some have committed suicide."
Well, they wanted to be heard.  They wanted to tell 
    31their stories.  Have they been allowed to?
That's primarily directed towards you, sir, because
you're the one who has had control of this Inquiry.
Overall the feeling is yes, you've allowed them to
be heard.  You've allowed them to have their say,
without constraints.  They were allowed to say, within
limits, whatever they wanted to say, and they were
allowed to do it in their words and they were allowed to
do it in their way.
Sir, unusually, we had straightforward hearsay
evidence.  Some people referring what had happened to
their father, even though they themselves were not alive
at the time and hadn't been born.  They appreciate, sir,
fully appreciate, that you're not just going to take
their evidence as it is, that you'd be weighing up other
evidence.  You won't deal with individual cases,
individual allegations.  You'll look at the matters in
the round.  They accept that.  But they've finally been
able to speak on behalf of themselves and, for that,
they thank you, sir.
The second issue which we looked at was the truth.
The way I put it, then, four and a half years ago, is
they want the truth.  When do they want it?  30 years
ago.  Well, we can say 34 years ago they'd like the
truth.  They'd like the truth.  The victims are angry 
    32that the Government has not faced up to what happened
and hasn't accepted responsibility.  During those years,
they've fought tooth and nail for everything, including
treatment and financial support.
This is the first and undoubtedly the last
opportunity for the victims to know the truth about why,
for what reasons and in what circumstances they were
exposed to contaminated blood products.  It is of the
utmost importance, and they know that it is your
intention, sir, to get to the truth of what has
happened.
What do they want the truth about?  We asked
ourselves four and a half years ago.  In one sense, the
answer to the question is quite simple and
straightforward.  They want to know the truth about
everything concerning the desperate situation in which
they have been placed by the actions of others.
Taking a slightly more focused approach, they wanted
the truth about each and every item identified in the
terms of reference.
Whether they get the truth is up to you, sir.  We
know you will consider the evidence very carefully.
You've been assisted throughout by Ms Richards, and
we're satisfied -- those we represent are satisfied
that, if I can put it this way, you'll do your best, and                
     33we're sure the best will be very thorough indeed.
Sir, the last thing we wanted is perhaps the most
difficult one.  We wanted justice.  It's difficult to
know how you can measure justice.  In this case,
thousands of people have died, thousands of people still
suffer from very severe ill health and, tragically, as
we just heard, it is likely that in the future more will
discover that they've been infected with hepatitis C and
more people will fall very ill.
The victims regard this Inquiry as a search for
justice.  There's a general view amongst the victims
that for over 40 years people in the know have kept
their mouths shut, their files closed, and their
shredders busy.  All they've received for all the
suffering, was a belated apology from Prime Minister
Cameron in 2015, for what that's worth.
Updating things four and a half years later, we have
an apology on behalf of the Department of Health, which
echoed an apology given a couple of days after I made
our original submission.  It was at that time
an unreserved apology for what had happened.
Quite where we stand on that apology, I don't know,
and at the moment, neither do you, sir, since they
declined to expand upon what they were admitting, which
is an extraordinary position to take. 
    34Whether or not they were entitled to refuse to
answer your questions is a different matter but it was
contemptuous not Ms Grey of course.  I don't blame her
at all.
What it was that Mr Snowden said the previous day,
which prompted them to halve their final submissions,
it's difficult to know.  Mr Snowden was very persuasive
and the six points he raised were, we thought -- and
respectfully endorsed -- were hardly a surprise to the
Department of Health.  They should have foreseen that
coming.
Sir, the question of justice includes, we would
say -- and this is a matter I am going to deal with in
more detail -- provision of health services -- I will
just leave that where it is at the moment because I'll
be coming back to it -- and also compensation.
I'd just like to look in a little more detail as to
what compensation is.  There's a danger that people, the
general public, might misinterpret what compensation is
all about.  In fact, the press often misinterpret what
compensation is all about.  It is made to seem, in some
people's eyes, as a win on the lottery, so people are
awarded £50,000, £70,000, £1 million, £5 million; it's
seen as a win on the lottery.  They put their hand in
the bran tub and they brought out a check for a quarter 
    35of a million.
You will know, sir, that's not the case.  I would
like to take you to the report of Sir Robert.  It's
page 41 of his report.  He very helpfully identifies the
rationale for compensation.  Page 41, "Terms of
Reference":
"To consider the rationale for compensation as
a matter of general principle and in relation to any
particular classes of compensation, recognising that it
is not for the Study to pre-empt the determination by
the Infected Blood Inquiry as to what, if any, rationale
is supported by the evidence it has received ...
"Definition of compensation.
"What does the term 'compensation' mean?  When
participants in our meetings were asked, few were able
to describe clearly what their concept of compensation
was.  Therefore, it may be helpful to set out the way in
which it is intended to use the term in this report.
"To start with, for the common use of the word, we
can refer to an online dictionary definition:
"'something, typically money, awarded to someone in
recognition of loss, suffering or injury'.
"Other dictionary definitions include:
"'money that is paid to someone in exchange for
something that has been lost or damaged or for some 
    36problem:
"'something that makes you feel better when you have
suffered something bad;
"'the act or process of making amends for
something'.
"A number of features should be noted --
compensation: 
"Is not limited to an award of money; 
"Involves a process; 
"Recognises that a person has suffered from
an injury or loss;
"Is intended to redress that injury or loss."
Then jumping over the next paragraph but going to
paragraph 4.6.
"For the purpose of this study, I shall adopt the
following definition:
"'An award of money or some other remedy to persons
who have suffered injury or loss ... indirectly or from
infected blood or blood products found to be eligible
for such an award to provide them with redress for and
recognition of the adverse experience they have
suffered'."
It's compensation for an injury.  If the injury is
small, compensation will be small.  If the injury is
awful, long lasting or causes death, the damages of                
     37compensation is commensurately higher.
Sir, once again, there is a tendency amongst the
public and the press to regard people who seek
compensation as somehow a form of ambulance chasing, or
people just wanting the money.  No doubt that will be
raised in this case.  It hasn't been raised at all so
far.
The way we would put it is like this, simple and
straightforward: what would you rather have, your son
alive or a large sum of money?  If we look at it like
that, it's very straightforward.  The compensation is
there to compensate people for injury and in these cases
very, very serious injuries.
I just want to compare some people's understanding
of what compensation is about and why it's awarded, that
it's linked to fault, with some former ministers'
appreciation of what compensation is about, and I'd like
now to be played a film of Edwina Currie.
(Video played)  

--Result #879--
   That film was made just a couple of years
after Edwina Currie had to stand down from being
a junior Minister in the Department of Health.  Her
comments were crass, unbelievably stupid.  She was
supposed to know about the disaster that was then
unfolding.  She was supposed to know about how HIV was 
    38at least said to be caused by the Government.  She
equated HIV -- and, by extension, hepatitis C -- to
something that just happens.  It didn't just happen.  It
happened because of the faults of the Government.  She
failed to recognise that.  In the position that she'd
formerly held, she would have known about the disputes
that were taking place.
If she doesn't know the difference between
compensation and just doling out money, if she doesn't
know the difference between having suffered harm,
someone gets compensation, than someone who hasn't
suffered harm, then how can we blame members of the
public, and perhaps even we can let out the press not
knowing the difference?
Her attitude there was appalling.  We'll come back
to Edwina Currie later.  I can see by the time we're
getting up to 11.15.  I don't know whether you want to
stop or just go on.  I'm quite happy to go on.

--Result #880--
   Yes, sir.
That was all an introduction to my first point upon
which I'm going to address you, which is compensation
for the infected and affected.
What should be done?  Our proposals for the scheme 
    39of compensation, its structure, and the issue of
eligibility and the calculation of quantum are based
primarily on the evidence of the infected and affected.
It's also based on the recommendations and oral
evidence of Sir Robert Francis KC, the evidence the
Inquiry has received concerning the means and systems
providing compensation and support in other countries,
particularly the Republic of Ireland, the present
systems used in the four countries for the support of
the infected and affected, and the existing common law
systems operated in the four countries in the UK.
The role of compensation is of the utmost
importance.  It represents a clear, unambiguous
acknowledgement and acceptance of responsibility for
this disaster, including HCV, HIV, HBV and uCJD (sic)
and acceptance by the UK Government and devolved
governments.  The mealy-mouthed words previously used by
them to justify the minimal amounts of money they
provided can be put behind us, we hope.  We hope that
responsibility is accepted.
Further, the payment of compensation should be seen
as an acknowledgement by them of a continuing obligation
to provide appropriate, fair, and reasonable
compensation and support in the future.
The four existing schemes for the provision of 
    40financial support for these infected and affected should
be amalgamated into one new system for compensation and
support.  Until the new system is set up -- and we
accept it will take a little time -- the running --
sorry.
Until the new system is up and running, the amounts
paid to the infected and affected will be given parity
between the four countries, so that under the respective
headings of loss each claimant receives the same amount.
The Government should establish a single scheme by
which each of these infected and affected receive fair,
just and equitable compensation for the harm they've
suffered and, in most cases, will continue to suffer for
many years into the future.
The compensation paid should be the same wherever
the recipient lives.  In order to meet these
requirements, the system should be founded on the
following principles: first, the infected and affected
should have an official unambiguous apology from the
UK Government for the harm caused to the infected and
affected, and an open acceptance by the UK Government
that the need for compensation arises because of their
responsibility for the harm they caused to the infected
and affected.
Secondly, the compensation is paid as of right --                
     41not as a matter of charity, but as of right -- because
of the harm they've suffered.
We adopt those principles set out in Sir Robert's
report at paragraph 4.75.  I'm going to go through
those, and that will take a little time, so now might be
time to stop it.

--Result #881--
   Sir, we were going to look at the principles
as enunciated by Sir Robert.  And that's at internal
page 60 of Sir Robert's report.
Just to explain the context of this, I was just
going to the principles upon which the system that we
propose, so our system, and setting out those
principles, and the first one we adopted was that set
out at paragraph 4.75 of Sir Robert's.  So we're going
to have a look at that: 
"Principles
"Having considered the rationales proposed for
compensation, as opposed to support, I turn to consider
the principles which should underpin a compensation 
    42scheme."
Then next down: 
"Remedial:
"The aim of a compensation scheme is, so far as can
be achieved by provision of money, support and services,
to provide eligible persons who have suffered injury or
loss directly or indirectly from infected blood or
blood, with proportionate redress for, and recognition
of, the adverse experience they have suffered.
"Respect for dignity:
"The scheme must restore and preserve applicants'
dignity and treat them with respect and confidentiality.
"Collaborative:
"The scheme should be collaborative with and
supportive of, applicants and, so far as possible, avoid
an adversarial approach to claims: applicants should be
believed unless the contrary is proved.
"Choice:
"The scheme should respect and enhance the autonomy
of applicants, including offering a choice of how
remedies are delivered.
"Individualised:
"Awards should reflect, in a proportionate and
consistent manner, the individual circumstances and
experience of applicants. 
    43"Inclusive:
"The scheme should recognise the direct impact of
the infection and its consequences on the infected
person, but also the indirect impact of the infection on
those closest to the infected person.
"Non-technical:
"There should be no bar to eligibility based on
technical issues, such as limitation through the passage
of time since the onset of the infection and its
consequences.
"Accessible:
"The scheme must be as readily accessible,
understandable and free of complexity and stress to all
potentially eligible persons, as is reasonably possible
with appropriate assistance."
Just underlying that, the last two words,
"appropriate assistance", sir, that's a matter which we
will look at in more detail in one moment.
It then goes on:
"Ease of proof:
"Unjust, distressing and disproportionate
requirements of proof and evidence should be avoided.
"Broad:
"Measures of compensation should be designed, so far
as possible, so that they are either to apply and 
    44represent broadly fair, proportionate compensation for
the injury and loss suffered as a result of the
infection, with due consideration of, but without being
bound by, the boundaries of entitlement to damages in
law.
"Improving:
"No claimant for compensation should be worse off
than they would be entitled without such a scheme, and
an award of compensation should not prevent the pursuit
of any entitlement to bring legal proceedings for the
same subject matter."
Then over the page, top of the page.
"Complementary:
"Continuing payments under the existing support
schemes should be continued, and made more secure
regardless of any claim for, or award of, compensation."
I just want to stop there, sir.
It's not always easy for people unfamiliar with
litigation or inquiries or compensation to necessarily
follow what we're saying.  Lawyers talk one language,
the general public speak their language, and they don't
always cross over very well.
I know this is a matter of great concern to many of
our Core Participants, but they fear that if they have
an award of compensation they will lose the regular                
     45payments they're receiving at the moment, and it is
crucial to many people that the regular payments they
receive at the moment continues into the future.  And
it's clear from Sir Robert's principles there that he
agrees. with our clients.
So, sir, that's a particularly important matter.
They don't want to forgo regular payments for
compensation, they want both.
Continuing:
"Holistic:
"Compensation is not just about money, but should
also include consideration of material means to
compensate for what has been lost."
So that's Sir Robert's recommendations.
We've drawn up our own list of recommendations.  To
an extent it mirrors what Sir Robert has said, or maybe
a slightly different way than Sir Robert has said, but,
sir, we thought it would be appropriate to set out
certain additions.
So, firstly, the purpose of the scheme is to ensure
that everyone who is entitled to compensation receives
compensation.
The scheme, we say, should be judge-led.
The scheme must be wholly independent of government,
whether UK-wide or devolved. 
    46We say there must be a dynamic, vigorous, and
proactive approach to identifying those entitled to
compensation.  There should be a search for them, and
all possible methods must be used.
Although there may in some claims be disagreement
concerning the entitlement of compensation or the amount
of compensation, the process of making a claim and
resolving the amount of compensation must, so far as
possible, be dealt with in a non-adversarial way.
The purpose of the process is one where the infected
and affected are to receive the appropriate amount of
compensation, not one where pressure is applied, direct
or indirect, or to accept less than the claim is worth.
A person seeking compensation should not be required
to waive their rights to pursue litigation.
The issues as to whom should receive compensation
and the amount that should be paid should be resolved as
soon as is reasonably practicable.  However, this has to
be balanced against the understandable desire of the
infected and affected to have careful consideration
given to their own individual case.
Sir, if I can just stop there for one moment.  The
tension between those two things can be met to an
extent, of course, by another interim payment to those
who have received an interim payment already.  And in 
    47respect of those that have not received an interim
payment, to have an interim payment in the very near
future.  That would allow some recompense, some
compensation to those who need it -- and they all need
this money, sir -- but also allow a balanced view to be
taken about the scheme to be set up and how the
compensation is to be calculated.
I continue.  Those recruited to run the scheme must
be provided with appropriate training in all aspects of
their respective roles.
Contrary to the position by Sir Robert, those who we
represent would wish to have the opportunity to be
legally represented going through this process, paid for
by the UK Government, so that the Core Participants, or
those seeking an award, can receive appropriate advice
and reassurance regarding the process of seeking an
award of compensation, advice regarding the various
types of compensation, and support and full explanation
of any decision they may have to make in respect of
eligibility and quantum.
It would be wholly inappropriate for the infected
and affected to have to rely on the guidance and support
of employees of an institution which is financed by the
body paying their compensation.  There's an obvious room
for conflict of interest, we say, sir. 
    48People don't have to have a lawyer, but if they want
one to help them, to give them advice, particularly on
the compensation to be calculated, the quantum of it,
then it may well assist them if they have a lawyer.
Given their previous experience of the trusts and
schemes, where they were treated with disdain, contempt
and distrust, dealt with as beggars seeking charity, not
as a person who had a right to compensation, and where
those who were acquiescent in this regime might be
treated more generously than those who tried to stand up
for their rights, waiting for the relationship of trust
to develop between those infected and affected and those
seeking to administer the scheme will take a long time.
In order to make sure that process of assessing the
amount of compensation to be awarded proceeds as
smoothly and as quickly as possible, the UK Government
should finance the provision of Legal Aid and
representation of the applicant.
We say there are further advantages in having legal
representation.  Firstly, the application for
compensation will necessarily require detailed
consideration of the applicant's medical records, which
sometimes will extend to a number of lever-arch files.
This is likely to be a traumatic and upsetting process
for the claimant as they are reminded of the many                
     49painful events which have occurred and which, in many
cases, will continue into the future.
This may be less traumatic if they are able to rely
on legal representatives who already know the background
to the scheme and the issues that may need to be
explored in any individual case.
Secondly, their medical records are likely to
contain private and confidential information, unrelated
to becoming infected, which should not be shared with
strangers.
Three, their present solicitors will have access to
the medical records and they will know the issues likely
to arise, and so will therefore be able to start
processing their application for compensation
immediately.  Those who don't wish to be instructed by
their present solicitors, then of course they are at
liberty to instruct another solicitor.
Insofar as may be necessary, the UK Government shall
fund the instruction of such independent medical experts
as the person claiming compensation may reasonably
require.  Those who receive compensation should be
entitled to an annual amount -- sorry -- to an annual
sum to pay a financial adviser to help them invest the
compensation and to manage their financial affairs.
The new scheme shall be funded by the UK Government. 
    50The amount of money required to fund the scheme shall be
provided by the UK Government on an annual basis.  There
will be no more reserves maintained by the body
administering the scheme.
The new scheme will be capable of being accessed
locally to ensure that, so far as possible, a trusting
relationship eventually develops over time between those
administering the scheme and those receiving
compensation.  The scheme should be co-designed by
a committee which should include representatives of the
infected and affected, so as to ensure that appropriate
weight is given to their interests and concerns.
There should be a representative of those infected
and affected on any group, subcommittee or panel
involved in setting up the scheme or continuing to run
it thereafter.
The infected and affected should be invited to play
an active and collaborative approach in the continuing
development of the scheme.  Every effort should be made
to ensure that the infected and affected are not cut
adrift or simply drift away from the tribunal or the
scheme.
The framework of the scheme.  There should be
established a judicial body known as -- this is our
suggestion, sir -- the Infected Blood Tribunal.  The 
    51lower level should make initial decisions on eligibility
and quantum.  The adjudicators should be of such calibre
as to engender in those making an application,
confidence and trust in their independence and ability.
Those making decisions affecting eligibility and quantum
should be experienced in the assessment of damages for
personal injury claims, and the assessment of relevant
medical matters.  They should receive training in the
possible effects of the relevant diseases.  They should
be provided with information concerning why this
disaster occurred and the devastating effect it has had
and continues to have on individuals and families.
They should be told of the way the infected and
affected have had to fight for justice for many decades
against intransigent, uncaring and defensive
governments.  The rules and procedures should be clear,
straightforward and well publicised.
Each tribunal of first instance shall be presided
over by a circuit judge.

--Result #882--
   Well, sir, there are number of reasons.  First
of all, from a practical point of view, as the scheme
develops over the years, there will be less and less
hearings.  There will be less and less call on circuit
judges.  So whilst they may be kept very busy and be on
their feet in the initial few years, eventually the
amount of work will diminish.  So the needs of the
schemes can be, we say, met by the existing circuit
judges.
We also say this is a very important tribunal.  It
will be seen as such, as very important.  It's very
important that the Core Participants have confidence in
the people they appear before.  Circuit judges, their
status is well known.  District judges sounds somewhat
less important than a circuit judge.  It's a matter of
appearance.  It's a matter of regular knowledge and
working with large personal injury claims.
The position seems to be at the time -- at the
moment that, even though district judges do have the
ability to deal with compensation --

--Result #883--
   Well, sir, we wish to avoid what appears to
have happened in the past, which is the scheme,
tribunal, getting into a certain way of thinking as to
how compensation should be awarded.  We believe that
judges coming in fresh to -- running the tribunal and
then going back to their regular work will bring
a breath of fresh air every time they're brought in.  We
don't want this to be seen simply as the same old, same
old, where it's the same judges dealing with it day
after day.

--Result #884--
   Sir.  There will be a positive obligation on
all tribunals to complete an application within
a reasonable time limit.  There will be an annual audit
assessing, amongst other things, the applications made,
applications concluded, applications outstanding,                
     57amounts awarded.
Until an application is fully resolved, compensation
would be paid on the basis of the existing schemes,
however all applicants should receive a highest amount
currently paid to any registrant under the existing four
schemes.
How should the scheme be run?  When the scheme is
established, all those presently registered on the four
existing schemes will automatically be transferred to
the new scheme.  The scheme shall then be responsible
for compensation and the ongoing regular financial
support for payments.  All new registrants shall
automatically be registered with the new scheme.
All applicants shall have the right to file
a statement, setting out their history, why they are
entitled to compensation, the extent to which they have
or will suffer harm and all past and future financial
loss together, if possible, with a schedule and list of
sums of sort.  In addition, they will be entitled to
file such further lay evidence as they think fit.
An IBI statement should be sufficient as long as it
contains all or part of the relevant information sought.
They can file reports from such experts as they think
fit; the respondent can file just a brief reply.
It will be a matter entirely for the applicant as to 
    58whether they give oral evidence and no adverse inference
can be drawn from their decision not to.  It will be
a matter entirely for the applicant as to whether they
call oral evidence from any other lay witnesses or from
their expert witnesses.
We adopt Sir Robert's Recommendation 4 but with some
additions.  So if we could just look at Sir Robert's
report.  These start at page 33, internal numbering.
Sir, if we just look very briefly at 1 and 2, they
are matters I'm going to come back to, sir, I'd just
like to deal with this as a preliminary matter.
Recommendation 3 we'll come back to, but
Recommendation 4, over the page, he says this:
"I recommend that the scheme should, so far as
possible, avoid legalistic and adversarial concepts of
the burden and standard of proof: establishing
eligibility under the scheme should be either:
"a) automatic in the case of infected persons
already accepted for eligibility under the support
schemes."
We would add to that "and affected", so it would
then read:
"automatic in the case of infected or affected
persons already accepted for eligibility in the support
schemes." 
    59"or
"b) a collaborative process [in respect of those not
yet registered] in which ..."
And then it sets out various things that the scheme
should do to help the applicant.

--Result #885--
   No, they're not alternatives, sir.
So we say that those who are registered now don't
have to prove anything.  They're automatically
transferred, things carry on as they are, they apply as
they no doubt would once they've considered their
position for compensation.  Those who are not yet
registered have to make an application.
If we can leave up Sir Robert's report, eligibility.
"Those infected and affected with HBV should be
awarded compensation on the same basis as though who are
infected and affected by HCV and/or HIV without the
necessity to establish that it is a serious case of
HBV."
The reference to serious cases found in
Recommendation 2, if we could go back a page, we say 
    60that -- sorry.  He says that he recommends:
"... that the scheme should offer redress to those
infected with HCV and/or HIV, and defined serious cases
of HBV ..."
We invite you to say that the recommendation
concerning "defined serious cases of HBV" be deleted,
and there's simply a reference to HBV.
I'm not going to go through all the reasons why HBV
should be incorporated into this.  It's been touched
upon in some detail yesterday by Leigh Day, and it may
be touched upon this afternoon by Mr Howells.
Next, subject to amending subparagraph (b) by
allowing claims for HBV as set out in Recommendation 2,
we say should be in Recommendation 2, by deleting
subparagraph (c), we adopt Sir Robert's
Recommendation 3.  I'm sorry if that's a bit convoluted,
sir, but that's the way we go around these matters.
In light of the evidence received by the Inquiry,
including date of knowledge, self-sufficiency and
a caution that should have been exercised regarding the
use of blood products, given its known potential for
transferring viruses, the application date is
unnecessary.  So the starting position should be dates
of exposure are irrelevant so long as there has been
exposure and so long as they've developed one of the                
     61relevant conditions.
If after the legal teams have met and the doctors
have met there's further consideration required about
dates, then it can be given at that time, and the
question of dates then become relevant.  But the
starting position is dates are not relevant.
We recommend that those infected but self-cleared
shall be entitled to register with the new scheme.
Appropriate bands should be created to allow claims to
be made for any harm suffered, in particular any shock
or distress experienced on being informed that they may
have been exposed to contaminated blood.
Save that the references to age at subparagraphs
(b), (c) and (d) be deleted, we adopt Sir Robert's
Recommendation 5.
If we can just look at that.  He recommended:
"... that the following relevant indirectly affected
persons should be admitted to the scheme ..."
So we have spouses, et cetera.
"b) children of an eligible infected person ...
"c) parents of eligible infected persons whose
eligible started in childhood;
"d) siblings living, while under the age of 18, as
a family with an eligible infected person."
We say that those references to age, either directly 
    62or implicitly, should be taken out.
The matter people are going to be compensated for,
if they are compensated, is something that struck not
just individuals but families.  It doesn't matter
whether you were 18 at the time or whether you're
a brother or a sister, were younger or older, siblings
will have suffered terrible hurt and shock and upset at
what took place.  The same will be in respect of
parents.  The same will obviously be in respect of
children.
This doesn't give a blanket of compensation to every
single person, but it makes it available to those who
have suffered harm without recourse to age limits.
We endorse the proposal made by Sir Robert at
page 132 that:
"... the approach of the scheme to the assessment of
eligibility, starting with the demands made on
applicants for information, should be to offer all the
best chance possible of establishing an entitlement,
rather than to be searching energetically for reasons to
exclude them."
We then continue:
"Where there is an absence of medical records and
the applicant asserts that they did receive blood
products or a blood transfusion, and/or a medical 
    63expert, states that the relevant medical procedure may
have involved the use of blood or blood transfusion,
there should be a presumption in favour of the
applicant.  The burden [and we say it should be a heavy
burden] should be on the respondent to rebut that
presumption."
We now turn to the assessment of quantum of damages.
Sir, there are many different methods by which
compensation could be calculated but, ultimately, there
seem to be two main methods, namely a system based on
the common law calculations of damage -- Sir Robert
calls this a bespoke method -- or (2) a system based on
set tariffs or bands of damages in respect of most types
of loss.
Sir Robert's report analyses the pros and cons of
each method of compensation and they'll be well known to
you, sir, and it's considered various types of
compensation schemes in the UK and abroad.
Sir Robert's report adopts a more nuanced approach
which is primarily tariff or band based but coupled with
significant elements of common law principles,
especially in respect of the calculation of future loss
of earnings and future care.  In addition, even in those
areas where compensation is banded, Sir Robert seems to
have allowed some wiggle room in respect of those that 
    64identify a greater loss than might normally be expected.
Some of our clients are attracted by the idea of
a common law approach, individually assessed
compensation, a bespoke method of calculation.  It
appears that there is a belief that, because it is
a bespoke approach, it is more likely to be accurate and
therefore must be a more generous approach than that
provided by the banded approach.
Those experienced in the common law approach to
compensation may think that these beliefs may be
misconceived.  To a greater or lesser extent, the amount
awarded on a common law approach will be based on
a considerable amount of guesswork, which, in the long
term, probably renders it no more accurate or generous
than a banded approach.
The main problem -- so far as this scheme is
concerned, the main problem with the common law
approach, is the inevitable delay that occurs in the
preparation of such a case, which is likely to defer
considerably from every other case in nearly every
respect.  Applying some knowledge of personal injury
claims, and considering the experience of the Republic
of Ireland, it seems to us to be inevitable that even
a partial resolution of these claims for compensation
will take a considerable time.                
     65That would be intolerable to the vast majority of
the people that we represent and, we suspect, to
everyone else.
At recent conferences, many of our clients agreed
that they wished the assessment of compensation to be
carried out as fast and as quickly as possible.  They
much prepared a banded approach.  Having been deprived
of proper, appropriate or any meaningful compensation
and indeed, in some cases, of any compensation for many
decades, it would be unacceptable to introduce a further
delay.
The following remarks, sir, are primarily directed
to the assessment of compensation as that advanced in
Sir Robert's report, the banded approach.
If we can have the report of Sir Robert back up, and
once again it's internal numbering 35.  So, Sir Robert's
recommendation: 
"... that infections eligible for compensation
should be classified in the following manner:
"there should be defined categories for each type of
eligible infection, and the stages through which it
progresses, and for each category defined degrees of
severity to which a range of possible awards for the
impact of the disease can be applied ..."
The first one is that:6"the stages and degrees of severity for each disease
should be defined by an independent clinical expert
advisory board, by reference to a clinical professional
consensus."
We say that the infected and affected should also
have representatives sat on that panel.  It's
intolerable that for the last 40 years they've been
spoken about as exhibits or something to be considered
at a distance.  It's imperative that they have some --
are able to provide some feedback into that committee.
The same in respect of (c):
"the range of potential awards for the impact should
be determined by an independent legal expert advisory
panel, to be consistent with what would be awarded in
common law personal injury litigation."
There, too, they should be represented.
It's important that all participants, all claimants,
feel confident that the various panels should have input
from, if you like, their own side, and they're entitled
to think of it as their own side because, for the last
40 years, it has been them and nearly everyone else.
They've fought for the right to have this award of
compensation; they should be represented.
Subject to that, we adopt Recommendation 6.
We adopt Recommendation 7.  That deals with 
    67aggravated and exemplary damages and it's a somewhat
specialised area.  We can leave that to one side.  With
the assistance of their lawyers, as we heard -- their
lawyers, you can be taken to that to see if there is any
merit in making such a claim.
We adopt Recommendation 8.  That's the separate
awards that are made to those eligible infected.  I'm
just going to read out the titles of the categories, but
no more.  So he recommends an injury impact award; he
recommends a social impact award; he recommends a care
award; an autonomy award; a financial loss award.
Recommendation 8 is adopted.
So far as Recommendation 9, save for paragraph (e),
we also recommend paragraph 9.
9(e) deals with a bereavement award.  That has
a fairly specialised meaning in common law claims.  It's
an award given to a limited number of people and it's
one award which is then, as you know, sir, spread out
amongst the various groups.  In other words, if one
starts with 15,000 people, and there's 15 people who
come in to the various categories -- unlikely to be 15,
but one never knows -- that's £1,000 each.
It's often been thought that a claim for bereavement
under the Fatal Accidents Act -- it's often been thought
that the awards are derisory and often excludes those 
    68who most need help.  Here, such an award would offer
very little to those who have suffered such grievous
loss and would be grossly insulting.  As we mentioned
already, the outstanding feature of these claims for
compensation is the way in which the disease has
destroyed families.  The effects of the diseases ran
through families and they still do.
We contend that, in respect of three categories
which we're going to identify, there should be a sum
awarded to each claimant in those categories.  So not
15,000 divided by 15, but 15,000 -- if that's the sum,
and I'm not suggesting it should be for one moment --
then 15,000 to each claimant.
In fact, for obvious reasons, we say it should be
considerably more than £15,000 to acknowledge the very
great hurt -- loss of these people.
So we say this: we believe that a suitable sum
should be awarded to mark the appalling loss suffered by
parents, children and siblings.  We recommend that each
parent alive at the time of the child's death,
regardless of the child's age, should be entitled to
receive a fair and equitable amount.  We recommend that
each child should receive a similar amount in respect of
the death of a parent, no matter what age the child was
at the date of death.  We recommend that each sibling                
     69should receive a similar amount, irrespective of the age
of the deceased or sibling at the time of death.
For the avoidance of doubt, these awards should be
paid in addition to any other sum to be paid under any
other head of loss.
Sir, we adopt Recommendations 10, 11, 12, 13, and
15.  I'm not going to read them out otherwise we really
will be here all day, but we adopt those recommendations
as well.
We also say that insurers, financial companies, must
provide financial products and mortgages to those
infected and affected, and any difference in premium to
those who would not be infected or affected should be
underwritten by the Government.
We recommend that in its report, the Inquiry
emphasises the need for appropriate compensation to be
awarded in the following circumstances.  We know that
some of these categories are already dealt with by
Sir Robert, but these are particular ones that concern
our clients, and so we put them before you as stand
alone recommendations, if you will.
So first of all, where couples were warned that they
should not have a child due to the risk that one or the
other might be infected with one of the relevant
diseases, as a result thereof they lost the opportunity 
    70of having children, there should be an award.  Where
couples were warned not to continue with a pregnancy
because of the risk that one or another might be
infected with one of the relevant diseases and that, as
a result the pregnancy was terminated, there should be
an award.
Where couples were warned after their child was born
of the risk that one or other might have been infected
with one of the relevant diseases, then whether or not
the child was infected -- on second thought, I should
just alter that to even where the child was not
infected -- they should have an award for any shock,
distress.
A separate category.  Women carriers of haemophilia
who, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, sought advice
from clinicians as to the risk of having a child and
were not warned of the risk of their child developing
hepatitis and/or HIV if they went ahead and had a child,
and subsequently it transpired that there had been
a significant risk -- and we do know there was
a significant risk -- then even though the child was not
infected, both parents and child could suffer
significant shock, anxiety and upset, and if they did,
they should be entitled to claim compensation.
Sir, to the extent we've not argued otherwise, we 
    71adopt Recommendations 16 to 19.
I just want to deal with some additional matters
with future compensation.  We say that once the Inquiry
has reported, it is likely there will be a flurry of
activity until the new scheme is up and running.
Following that, it is likely that the public, press and
Government's interest in the blood scandal will diminish
until it becomes, I'm afraid, sir, a distant memory.  We
contend that, as well as an appropriate scheme of
compensation, radical improvements in their healthcare
and appropriate findings concerning wrongdoing, the
infected and affected have the right to expect that the
continued health and wellbeing of the infected and
affected is supported, advanced and protected by some
independent person or body to be established as soon as
possible.
These people who have suffered for so long should
not be forgotten or cut adrift.  We have invented the
title of "Infected Blood Victim Commissioner" but we're
open to any more manageable title than that, sir.
We say the infected and affected should play a part
in setting up the scheme and, thereafter, their views
should be sought at regular intervals.  The Commissioner
should be fully funded but wholly independent from the
Government, both UK and devolved.  It is important that 
    72the Commissioner is established at the outset, in order
to play a constructive role in the establishing of
a scheme.
Sir, when we make this recommendation, we don't seek
to replicate the established position of Victim
Commissioner, which covers all manner of issues
connected with the criminal law.  Rather, we invite the
Inquiry to give consideration to the role of the
Commissioner of Survivors of Institutional Childhood
Abuse, an independent organisation established by the
Government to assist the victims and survivors following
the report of the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry
in Northern Ireland, which reported in 2017.
The role of the Commissioner -- presently, we
believe, Fiona Ryan -- is to empower victims and
survivors to exercise their rights.  The Commissioner
has various statutory powers given to her, including
powers to undertake or commission research, to compile
information, to provide advice or information, to
publish anything concerning their interests and to make
representations or recommendations to any person or body
concerning the interests of the victims and survivors.
We recommend that a similar commissioner should be
set up as soon as possible to represent the interests
and to protect the wellbeing of the infected person.                
     73The Commissioner should be given a very wide discretion
as to how they carry out their duties, thus the
Commissioner should be allowed to campaign on behalf of
the infected and affected, should be allowed to seek
higher awards of compensation and should be allowed to
make recommendations to central or devolved governments
regarding all matters affecting the lives and wellbeing
of the infected and affected.
Sir, that's all we have to say about compensation.
I now want to turn to the issue of healthcare.

--Result #886--
   Not in my experience, they weren't, sir.
Anyway. 
The heading on the next and final item is previous
trusts and schemes, which is about their conduct, or 
    83misconduct.  Before I go specifically to the trusts and
schemes, I just want to open that bracket a bit wider,
because the trusts and schemes, or at least these
particular ones, took their lead from the Department of
Health, and so it's important to know the type of person
who would be in charge of the Department of Health.
So we're going to return to Edwina Currie.  She was
in the junior ministry.  The excerpt of a letter that
we're going to look at was, I think, written before she
resigned, or was sacked, and you'll see what she says.
So this is to Ms -- "Dear Mrs Grindley -- can I just
say, sir, we have Mrs Grindley here -- over there --
a stalwart campaigner on behalf of the haemophilia
cohort, husband died as a result of infection.  And
she's been a regular correspondent with the Inquiry,
putting good questions and good issues which she wanted
raised.
So, 23 March 1987.
"Dear Mrs Grindley,
"Mrs Currie has asked me to thank you for your
letter of 13 February about her remarks on 12 February
about AIDS.  She has asked me to reply.
"I am sorry that you do not agree with what she
said.  We are very concerned about the dangers of AIDS.
There is no cure or vaccine, no prospect that either 
    84will be developed for some years.  The government is
supporting research and funding a wide-ranging public
education campaign to bring home the threat that AIDS
poses to us all.  It is essential that the message is
put across clearly, at every opportunity, that the only
way to stop AIDS spreading is for all our people to
behave responsibly."
"Mrs Currie has asked me to thank you for your
letter of 13 February about her remarks of 12th February
about AIDS."
Sorry, I'm repeating myself.
It goes down to the last but one paragraph:
"I understand that you take particular exception to
Mrs Currie's reminder about good Christian people not
catching the disease.  She had in mind merely that, for
most people, a responsible and caring way of life should
protect them and their loved ones from the threat of
AIDS in the future.
"Thank you for taking the time to write about this
important matter."
That's an astonishing letter for a minister in the
Health Department to write.  It's grossly insulting to
many groups.  One gets a hint of homophobia there.  It's
insulting to people who don't lead a "good Christian
life".  It suggests that if you have HIV that maybe you                
     85don't lead a good Christian life.  It suggests that --
this sounds positively medieval -- but if you are a good
Christian, that will stop you getting HIV.
There's not an awful lot more for me to say about
that letter.  It speaks for itself and what it says is
dreadful.
So put that to one side and let's go back if we may
to the previous trusts and schemes.  Thank you,
Lawrence.
So this section will comment upon the purposes for
which the trusts and schemes were set up, whether they
supported the infected and affected, the manner in which
the trusts and schemes treated them, and the extent to
which they operated in an open and fair manner.
They operated along similar lines, often using the
same staff, especially at a senior manager level.  For
the most part we did not intend to consider each scheme
separately, rather we will take an overview of the
schemes.  Given the time that has elapsed since the
closure of the old schemes, the setting up of the
present schemes and with the prospect that a wholly new
compensation scheme will be devised, we have no
recommendations to make on the issues arising under this
particular heading.
I should perhaps have added a sentence, "But please 
    86make sure that no one ever behaves as badly as these
people did."
We have extracted from the evidence of the infected
and affected their comments about their dealings with
the schemes.  We also have relied upon the evidence of
employees of the schemes.  I'll just name them so you
can see we've taken a fairly widespread view, Ann Lloyd,
Nick Fish, Mark Mildred, Russell Mischon, Susan Daniels,
Ann Hithersay and Jude Cohen, although there are others
as well.
We do, however, invite the Inquiry to make the
following findings -- so no recommendations but
findings: 
That the purpose of creating these schemes was not
to provide meaningful and appropriate support for the
infected and affected, rather, they were used by the
UK Government as a means of avoiding any investigation
into this medical disaster, whilst at the same time
appearing to provide some support to certain categories
of those infected and affected.
That the schemes were used as a smokescreen to cover
up the lack of any meaningful, financial or other
support.
That the use of arm's-length bodies was a device by
which the UK Government could cover up their control of 
    87the activities of the schemes.  The schemes operated as
if they were an extension of the DoH, whilst keeping the
registrants at arms-length.  They did not seek to
protect the beneficiaries, rather, they sought to
protect the Department of Health.
We then set out some examples.
In any dispute regarding the beneficiaries and the
Department of Health, the schemes took the side of the
Department of Health.
The schemes were not accountable to the
beneficiaries, or at least they acted as if they
weren't.  Rather, they appear to have decided that they
were accountable only to the Department of Health.
They declined to raise issues which might have
caused embarrassment to the Department of Health.  They
appear to have decided that they would not rock the
boat.
They refused to promote or advertise the schemes,
preferring any potential applicants to find them.
They refused to campaign for the infected and
affected, in particular for more money from the
Department of Health or seek any public contributions.
They refused to campaign for greater social and
health support for the infected or affected.
Those who controlled the schemes, the chair, the 
    88deputy chair, the trustees, took their lead from the
Department of Health, and from the civil servants that
sat on the boards.
They followed what they regard as the Department of
Health's line.  So, by way of an example, they built up
reserves of money when told, they reduced the Reserves
of money when told, and they didn't object when told
transfer the remaining funds to the Terence Higgins
Trust, even though the beneficiaries of those schemes
wanted the funds to be distributed to them.
They didn't seek to empower the infected and
affected.
The agonisingly slow speed at which the various
schemes developed illustrates the uncaring attitude of
the UK Government.
We say the schemes were run in an  ad hoc, careless,
inefficient, bizarre and illogical manner.  So by way of
example, they employed people who for the most part had
no previous experience of medical matters, let alone any
knowledge of HIV or hepatitis.  They employed people who
for the most part had no previous experience of
exercising any sort of discretion to decide whether or
not an applicant should receive support or not.
They employed such people without providing any
induction into their roles.  They appear to have been                
     89expected to learn what they were supposed to do as they
carried out their tasks.
Most had little experience of financial matters.
They were expected to decide whether a beneficiary
should be supported by helping the person to buy their
own home on a mortgage.  And if so, would it be by
making a grant, by a loan, or taking a mortgage on the
property or by some other means?
In finance, they don't seem to have had any fixed
policy as to whether -- where it was financed by a loan
or mortgage, whether it was transferable.  They made
their decisions on the hoof.
The beneficiaries were expected to get two
quotations for every item or piece of work which they
needed to be paid for, no matter how small.  The schemes
could refuse the request, might require lower quotations
to be obtained, or allow part of the request but require
the beneficiary to pay the balance.  This process, which
was not required under the terms of the Trust, could
cause, and would cause, maximum delay, maximum
frustration, distress and upset.
There was no attempt to identify and reach out to
the infected and affected to alert them that they and
their family might be entitled to support.
The evidence that the Inquiry has received in 
    90respect of widows is that they made no attempt to
contact the widows because they thought that they would
have known about the various schemes by keeping in
contact with the haemophiliac centres after the death of
their husbands.  This is an absurd approach to keep in
contact with the infected or affected.  These are women
whose husbands were -- I was going to use the emotive
term "killed", but that -- I'll use a lesser term -- who
were responsible for the deaths of their husbands, and
they seem to have thought that they would remain in
contact with the hospital.  It's preposterous.
There were no fixed criteria to be used to decide
whether an application for support should be granted.
There were no secretarial resources.
The applicant couldn't support their application
with a statement or photograph.
The applicant could not support their application
with medical evidence.
Often, there was no forum on the schemes' websites,
or if there had been one it was shut down when people
became too critical of the schemes.
The applicant was not entitled to attend the meeting
when their application was considered.
The applicant was not entitled to give oral
evidence. 
    91Just stopping there for one moment.  They seem to
have broken nearly every rule that you'd use to create
a court, a tribunal, something to be heard and where
a judicial type of decision should be made.  Excluded
every possible avenue of contact.
The receipt of blood had to be confirmed by an
applicant's medical notes.  It was not sufficient that
the applicant or their doctor confirmed that blood was
or was likely to have been used.
No record was kept of the consideration of the
claim.
If a medical opinion was sought, then it was done on
an ad hoc, informal and unreported basis.
For the most part there was no one who could advise
them on benefits.
There were no regional support workers.
There was no long-term plan as to how the schemes
could be developed to provide support for the infected
and affected.
The amount of money paid was very low.  The amounts
paid were inconsistent between one registrant and
another, notwithstanding they wanted the same item.
The registrants were expected to apply for support
from other sources before applying to the schemes.  This
wasn't a requirement in the documents setting up the 
    92schemes; it's just a rule they decided to impose.  The
net effect of this was that, once again the application
of schemes was unnecessarily delayed.
The applicant was not informed as to why their
application had failed.
The applicant was not informed what additional
document, if it had been provided, would have allowed
the application to be successful.
Whether deliberately or otherwise, those in charge
of the schemes didn't try to develop or encourage
a meaningful, constructive relationship with the
infected or affected.  On occasions, those in charge of
the schemes would act in a deliberately awkward and
obstructive manner, and we will come to examples of that
shortly.
The schemes made no attempt to contact or in any
constructive way communicate with the registrants.  The
schemes refused to publish any information or guidance
regarding the discretionary items that could be claimed
or the amount that would be allowed.  They seem to have
thought that the registrants could not be trusted, that
such was their character that they would make a claim
for everything they could and for the maximum amount
available.
They were concerned that if they published such                
     93a list, the "great unwashed", as these people were
described, would use it as a shopping list.  What
an appalling attitude to bring to the distribution of
funds, even the minimum money that was available, in
dealing with these applications, and these badly hurt
people.
The approach about the question of shopping lists is
somewhat ironic, given the fact that the only evidence
of dishonesty is that of Foster, an employee of the
schemes, who carried out a wholly unsophisticated fraud
by paying cheques to the value of £400,000 to himself.
Despite the absence of any evidence or indeed allegation
of dishonesty on the part of the infected or affected,
it appears to be them who were made subject to more
stringent conditions.
The registrants were not invited to take part in any
important meetings with the trustees or representatives
of the Department of Health.  There was, for the most
part, no newsletter, no partnership group.  Their
address -- and you'll remember the evidence of
Mr Peter Stevens, who we'll come to in one moment in
more detail -- their address was kept a secret because
they didn't want unwanted callers.
That's you they didn't want.

--Result #887--
   So, sir, I'd just like to, as a last point,
deal with a particular family.  It's the Lewis family
from Cardiff.  So perhaps we can have the photo of Mr
and Mrs Lewis up, please.  There we are.
Ladies and gentlemen, this photograph has been
produced before.  That's Haydn Lewis with his wife.
There's also a picture which we don't need to turn to,
of Gareth Lewis.  Gareth was Haydn's brother.  They
lived in Cardiff.  Haydn and Gareth developed HIV and
hepatitis C.
They had received that whilst being treated by
Dr Bloom at the University Hospital.  Haydn wasn't
immediately told that he had HIV, as a result of which
he infected his wife, that's Gaynor Lewis.  They had two
children.  Fortunately, the children survive and so does
Mrs Lewis.
At a very early stage, particularly Haydn but also
Gareth, became involved in campaigning for the rights of
the infected and affected.  The prompt for that seems to
have been the result of the death of a young boy in the 
    98clinic.  We've had his name, Colin.  Such was the
distress they felt was they thought they should do
something about it.  So the two of them set up the
Birchgrove Group, in the Birchgrove pub, and that went
on to be the Birchgrove organisation more generally, and
then I think became Tainted Blood.
Although, from the descriptions we've had, Gareth
was a somewhat fiery individual, Haydn was less so.
Haydn has been described as a thoughtful, polite,
hardworking young man.  Unfortunately, because he was
a campaigner, he seems to have fallen foul of
Mr Peter Stevens.  Mr Stevens -- a degree from Oxford
University, obviously very clever -- became a financial
analyst during the course of his professional career,
became a trustee of the Macfarlane Trust in -- if I can
read my writing -- '87.  He then sat on nearly every
board that was dealing with compensation -- well,
dealing with support, and he ended up a director of the
Skipton Fund.
For reasons which are inexplicable, Mr Stevens,
treated Mr Haydn Lewis in a terrible manner.
In making these remarks, I bear in mind that
Mr Stevens also suffered grievous loss in this medical
disaster, with at least one son infected and one son
infected who died.  That makes his behaviour even 
    99more -- sorry.  That makes his behaviour that much more
surprising.
I want to deal with the cross-examination of Gaynor.
So this is the transcript, sir, 26 July 2019, of
Gaynor Lewis.  She deals with a number of things.  As we
will see.
So the question -- I think it was Ms Richards who
was conducting the questioning:
"I just want to ask you, as the last area of
questioning that I have for you, about the Macfarlane
Trust.
"Mmm.
"Haydn had a lot of dealings over the years with the
Macfarlane Trust.  You've described them in your
statement from your own perspective as terrible to deal
with?
"Mmm.
"An uphill battle with obstacles in the way and
Haydn was particularly concerned that they weren't
providing enough financial help and support.
"That's right and there was one time when we moved
to the house we're now in, there was work being done,
a downstairs bathroom.  We called them adaptations but
the Macfarlane Trust would see it as renovations and the
council would pay so much towards the work but there was 
   1005,000 needed and we asked or Haydn asked for the money
and this was bouncing back and forth for a couple of
months, I think.  And Fran rang one day and said, 'We've
had a meeting and I'm sorry you can't have it' [the
money].  I burst into tears because I could see the work
being done, it was boosting him and giving him something
to get up for, you know.
"So I burst into tears and she said 'I'll phone you
back, hang on', they changed their mind just like that.
What if I hadn't burst into tears?  What about all those
other people that just accept it?  No, they were awful."
So we say that was appalling behaviour.  There
either is a rule that they apply, and guidance that they
apply, or there isn't.  But they're persuaded to go one
way not the other because of whatever reasons they had
for not advancing the money to Mr Haydn Lewis, and then
they changed because a woman cries.  As she herself
says, what if she hadn't cried?  They wouldn't have got
the money, they'd have had a building half finished.
Then Ms Richards goes on:
"We're going to look first of all at a letter and
then at some emails.
"The letter is 2368009, please ...
"This a letter dated 30 April 1996, from the
Macfarlane Trust.  It's addressed to Dr Dasani and it                
    101says this ..."
I should explain, Dr Dasani was one of the main
people in charge of the haemophilic --
Only two more days then you can have your phone on
whenever you like!
Dr Dasani was one of the doctors in charge at the
Cardiff haemophilia centre.  It says:
"'Dr Dasani, your patient shown above has made
a request to the Trust for the financial assistance,
which will be considered by our trustees at their
meeting in three weeks' time.  Since on present policy
single payments are almost invariably health related the
trustees have decided that the anonymous case summaries
which they receive in advance of their meetings should
contain up-to-date health information gathered in
a consistent fashion.  To meet this aim where the health
information held on a particular patient is older than
six months a doctor's report will be requested.'
"Then there's reference to how often doctors might
be asked to provide information.  Then it says this:
"'All the information contained in the completed
report will be treated as given in confidence to the
Trust and will not be shared with the patient
concerned.'"
Gaynor: "It doesn't surprise me. 
   102"Were you aware the Macfarlane Trust was asking for
confidential medical reports --
"No.
"-- the contents of which wouldn't be shared with
you?
"No."
Once again, sir, it hardly needs saying, what
appalling conduct.  They're getting secret reports from
a patient and getting a doctor to conspire in that by
not telling their client -- sorry, their patient -- what
they're doing.  Then it says:
"Could we have up on the screen, please ... 2368016.
"We're going to look at some details between Martin
Harvey, Chief Executive of the Macfarlane Trust, and
Peter Stevens, Chair of ..."
Then Gaynor intervenes:
"Can I just say that before -- well, before we read
this, the context of this is that Haydn -- I didn't --
kept the £20,000 when the first payment and my boys
didn't get the Category G payment either so Haydn was
talking to the Trust.  He didn't want a penny more or
a penny less, only what we deserved and this is the
outcome."
Ms Richards: "You were what the Trust termed and the
Inquiry has heard the phrase before in relation to other 
   103witnesses an infected intimate?
"Yeah, nice.
"We see -- thank you for explaining the context.  We
see what the email is."
So a quotation:
"'Martin, what's with these people?
"'Funnily enough, when you set it out as you have
done it makes one wonder why infected intimates are
treated exactly as registrants, since they do not have
haemophilia to worry about.  We might see if we can
review that when we get round to looking at regpay
[which I'm reliably informed were the regular payments
that were made] at the NSSC (that would be a way of
pissing off the Lewis contingent).'"
Unbelievable, sir, that someone could write about
that with one brother infected with HIV, hepatitis B,
the other brother also infected, and he knew that Gaynor
also had HIV.
"The second email we're going to look at is the
second page, please ... We'll just look at the top,
first of all.  The context here is an email here from
Haydn referred to a meeting he'd attended where he had
lost his temper and it's an email in which he says he
was so angry and frustrated with the meeting, he was
unable to make his point and get any sensible answers, 
   104and he lost his temper and he says in the email at the
top: 
"'I would like to apologise to all present at the
meeting.'"  
That's Haydn apologising.
"Then he says this:
"'I ended the matter with a statement of never
writing to either the Chairman or the [Chief Executive]
again which is a sad conclusion to the whole matter.
What I am even sadder about is that the Chairman and CE
don't even seem to care that one registrant has now lost
all faith in the honesty and integrity of those involved
and I'm left with no way of contacting the Trust with
any belief of what they will tell me is true.'
"Then further on he adds that you will now be
dealing with the Trust on behalf of both of them."
So, that's Gaynor will be dealing with them.
"Then if we go down to the bottom email, please
[then Ms Richards reads it out].  It's from Peter
Stevens to Martin Harvey:
"'Martin, as I prepare to go to bed I recall
that I shall never have a private email from Haydn Lewis
again.  Oh happy day!  (Indeed, Calloo! Callay! but
I have not yet discovered whether you, too, nurse
a Lewis Carroll streak).                
    105"'Otherwise, what a monumental waste of time -- not
just this afternoon, but all the previous hours spent
nurturing that lot of moaners.  As [and then there is
a reference to an individual] said, there are some
people who want to get on with their lives.  However,
I guess we just have to persevere.  Peter.'
"The third email that you have provided to the
Inquiry, Gaynor, is the fifth page, please ... 
"We can see again the context here is an email from
Haydn to Peter Stevens.  I should say that these emails
are all from 2004 and it's an email in which Haydn sets
out number of matters that he is asking to be
considered.  We might go through the detail of that.  We
can see the context from the email itself.  We can go to
the bottom of the page, please, from Peter Stevens to
Martin Harvey:
"'Martin, notwithstanding the heading' -- the
heading being 'Private letter chairman MFT' --
'I thought you'd love to join me in starting the week
with an insight into the thoughts of Haydn Lewis.
"'I shall try to compose a reply in the course of
the day.  I shall point out to him that I am unable to
provide him with information about expenses without
asking you.
"'It's irritating that someboyd [sic] so thick can 
   106come up with such meddlesome suggestions.'
"He spelt 'somebody' wrong!
"Yes, spelt incorrectly."
Of course, sir, there is always the possibility that
he was going to say "some boyo", we don't know.  You
seem puzzled at that suggestion, at that word.

--Result #888--
   Sir, I intend to make submissions on three main
issues.  Firstly, the unlawfulness of the disparity that
emerged in the support schemes in the four nations.
Secondly, the failure of the Wales Office and the
Northern Ireland Office to achieve self-sufficiency in
their respective nations.  And thirdly, the conflicts of
interest that impacted upon decision making and the
implementation of those decisions.
Turning first of all to the unlawfulness of the
disparity in the support schemes, may I preface this
section with three points.  Firstly, this really matters
to our clients, and so it is important that I address
you in relation to it fully.
Secondly, some level of technicality is unavoidable,
but I shall try to minimise that technicality.
Thirdly, the ultimate point is that there should
never have been different financial provision in the
four nations, and that should never happen again.
It is well known in this Inquiry that when the                
    109UK Government announced an uplift to the payments in the
English Infected Blood Support Scheme, which I shall
call EIBSS, on 30 April 2019, there were no equivalent
uplifts made to the payments for the support schemes in
Wales and Northern Ireland.  The difference in payments
was not insignificant.
That position was allowed to continue until
25 March 2021, when finally the four nations reached
agreement on what parity meant across the four schemes,
and Her Majesty's Treasury provided funding to the
governments of Wales and Northern Ireland so that the
payments made by their schemes were increased.
So for a period of almost two years the
UK Government allowed a position to continue whereby the
infected and affected who lived in Wales and
Northern Ireland were treated differently to those who
lived in England.  For two years, during the currency of
this Inquiry, the UK Government exacerbated the
resentment and mistrust felt by many, if not all, of our
clients who reside in those countries.
This was at a time when the healing process bought
about by this Inquiry should have been taking place.
Let it not be thought that the only real effect on
our clients was financial disadvantage.  No.  The
utterly inexplicable difference in treatment caused an 
   110increased sense of injustice and a feeling that not only
did the UK Government not care about them in the 1970s
and the 1980s, but that it did not care about them now.
Lawrence, please can I ask for WITN4506014.
This is a letter from Dr Coffey, who is a consultant
clinical psychologist based at the Wales Infected Blood
Support Scheme, which I shall call WIBSS, and it's to
the Welsh Government dated 11 March 2021.
If I could start with the second paragraph, please.
Dr Coffey says this:
"It is crucial that the context and impact of the
decisions of a higher powered organisation are seen as
relevant and need consideration.  There are similarities
between the decisions of the governments now, and the
NHS then, which is a reminder of the harm not help that
was inflicted upon the beneficiaries.
"Understandably, people report entrenched feelings
of anger and injustice, alongside damaged identities
related to feeling like 'a second-class citizen', as
unworthy and undeserving due to a growing awareness that
harm was knowingly inflicted on an 'unimportant' group
of people.  The extent of the psychological injury is
unquestionable.  The acceptance and normalisation of the
harm caused is only more recently being exposed and
challenged but the current legitimisation of the lack of 
   111parity is a highly sensitive reminder that again such
people are targeted as 'less than' causing secondary
psychological injury.
"The inequality provokes reactivation and reliving
of past traumatic experiences and can be perceived as
confirmation that fairness is not required due to the
'second class citizen' status.  Equality and fairness
would help to interrupt the trauma cycle and the
associated symptoms providing a platform for the complex
journey towards adjustment and acceptance of situations
of harm and injustice.
"Achieving parity would demonstrate the importance
of recognising the need for fairness and justice.
I have been struck by the resourcefulness and resilience
shown by the beneficiaries of the scheme and surprised
by the desire to 'move forward' from such painful
experience.  Realistically the associated traumas will
never be resolved but it is psychologically damaging and
limiting progress if aspects of inequality, in
particular the lack of financial parity across the four
devolved schemes are not currently addressed."
The disparity in payments should never have been
allowed to happen.  The suggestion that the schemes were
established by each of the four nations to respect the
devolution settlements is, we say, a fallacy.  The truth 
   112of the matter is that they are the unfortunate
consequence of flawed and opportunistic decision making
by the UK Government.
The original plan in 2016, when the UK Government
first started drawing up consultation plans, was that
there would be a UK-wide scheme.
The reference for that, sir, is WITN4688013.
We now know that as a result of the Scottish
Government making a unilateral decision to establish its
own scheme, the UK Government reacted by establishing
EIBSS, without further discussion with the Governments
of Wales and Northern Ireland.  I will invite you, sir,
to see, in particular, the evidence of William Vineall,
a senior civil servant in the DHSC, who gave evidence
alongside Matt Hancock at page 108 of the transcript,
and also document WITN0066007 at pages 3 and 4.
That this was the situation was confirmed by
Vaughan Gething, who was then the Minister for Health
and Social Services, who admitted that the Welsh
Government reacted to the decision of the UK Government
and set up WIBSS out of necessity.  I would invite you
to see pages 8 and 9 of the transcript of his evidence.
So the schemes in the four nations were not the
result of a conscious decision, but that is what
devolution demanded.                
    113The result is a curious dichotomy in the approach to
those infected with HIV and to those infected with
hepatitis C.  The UK Government has always accepted its
responsibility to fund HIV payments, and it continued to
do so by way of a budget transfer to the governments of
Wales and Northern Ireland.  The references for that are
WITN4065004 at paragraph 12, and DHSC0003814_090 at
paragraph 37.
But the UK Government takes the view that the
Governments of Wales and Northern Ireland are
financially responsible for hepatitis C payments because
these were established after devolution.  That is to say
that the first devolution settlement took place in 1998
and the Skipton Fund was established in 2004.
It is incongruous that there should be a difference
in the identity of the government with financial
responsibility for payments for each of HIV and
hepatitis C when both viruses were transmitted in blood
and blood products at a time long before the devolved
governments were established.  It is frankly illogical
to say that the devolved governments have competence to
make hepatitis C payments but do not have competence to
make HIV payments.
WIBSS was given statutory powers to make payments to
eligible persons by the Wales Infected Blood Support 
   114Scheme (No. 2) Directions 2017.  Those directions were
made under the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006,
which is an Act of the UK Parliament.  If that Act gave
the Welsh Ministers a power to make payments to infected
persons through WIBSS, there is no proper basis for
saying that it did so only in relation to hepatitis C
and not HIV.
That is because the exercise of the power under that
Act was not conditioned by devolved competence.  It was
a statutory function given to the Welsh Ministers by an
Act of the UK Parliament.
The Inquiry has heard evidence that in 2002
a dispute arose between the UK Government and the
Scottish Government about whether the Scottish
Government can make payments for hepatitis C.  The
reference for the email raising the dispute is
DHSC0042275_129.  That was an internal email to
Charles Lister in November.
That resulted in a joint advice from the UK and
Scottish Law Officers.  So may I bring that on screen.
Lawrence, it's DHSC0042275_012.
If I could just have the summary to begin.
Sir, the summary says:
"In summary the Law Officers consider that the
Scottish Executive's proposed scheme for payments to 
   115persons infected with Hepatitis C, as a result of
treatment by the NHS in Scotland, would be within
devolved competence."
So that's the Law Officers saying Scotland can set
up the scheme if they want to.
Then, Lawrence, can we go to paragraph 3 on page 2.
At paragraph 3 the Law Officers set out the features
of the scheme proposed by the Scottish Government and,
sir, I would draw your attention to the last bullet
point, that what was being proposed was that:
"No payments are to be made to dependants of
infected patients."
Now, I say that's important to understand the advice
going forward.
Then, Lawrence, paragraph 16, page 4.
Ultimately this is the reasoning given by the Law
Officers as to why it was within the competence of the
Scottish Government.
"In this instance, the Law Officers consider that
sufficient additional factors exist to indicate that
what has been proposed by the Scottish Executive differs
in purpose from a scheme for financial assistance for
social security purposes.  The Scottish Executive has
the stated purpose of providing compensation to
a particular class of individuals who suffered injury 
   116through a particular source.  These people are to
qualify for payment not on the basis of being sufferers
of Hepatitis C, but rather where it can be shown that
they have been infected by that virus and this has been
caused by NHS treatment in Scotland, an agency of the
State for which the Scottish Executive is responsible.
That infection, so caused, is proposed to be treated as
an injury for which compensation should be paid, on
a no-fault basis.  It is understood that the concept and
function of compensation in this context would be
broader than that of damages, the latter being more
calculated to respond to the degree of loss sustained in
any particular instance."
That's the reasoning.
Then, Lawrence, paragraph 22 on page 5, please.
The Law Officers were obviously aware of the HIV
payments, and this is what they say about it:
"At the same time, the Law Officers recognised that
there will be a need to maintain a consistent and
coherent approach to other payment schemes in the
assessment of whether they fall within devolved or
reserved competence.  For instance, the Law Officers are
aware that schemes for the payment of those infected
with the HIV virus through treatment by the NHS have
been dealt with as schemes for social security                
    117purposes."
I pause there to interject that that would therefore
mean it is not within devolved competence.
"It is understood that the trusts which operate
those schemes have been paid entirely from funds from
the UK Government, including in the period after
devolution.  Yet if the driving purpose behind these
schemes has also been the provision of compensation to
persons who have been injured through HIV infection
caused by the NHS (ie not simply to sufferers of HIV),
there may be nothing to distinguish that purpose from
what is proposed by the Scottish Executive in relation
to Hepatitis C.  The Law Officers do not attempt to
resolve this particular issue, but see that it raises
questions of this kind.  They observe that it might also
be possible to distinguish such a scheme from that
applicable to those infected with [vCJD], if the basis
of payment to such sufferers is simply infection of that
illness, from whatever source.  But [they] express no
view ..."
That leads to this submission, sir: that it may be
that the UK Government formed the view in 2004, which is
a view they still hold, that it was not responsible for
hepatitis C payments across the UK based on this advice.
If so, if they took that view, then it is wrong for 
   118three reasons.
Firstly, the Law Officers were specifically advising
about a compensation payment to an injured person which
did not involve payments to dependants.  The
Skipton Fund, conversely, did make payments to
dependants and contained discretionary elements based on
need.
Secondly, the Law Officers specifically identify
that HIV payments are to be treated as relating to
social security, and it was hard to distinguish between
the two.
Thirdly, this advice related to the Scotland Act
1998, which, from the outset of devolution, empowered
the Scottish Parliament to legislate on all matters save
for reserved matters.
That was different to the form of devolution that
existed in Wales at that time, and so the advice could
not be read across to Wales.
We have provided the Inquiry with a note on the
phases of devolution in Wales to assist with an
understanding of that difference.  Jane Hutt, the first
Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services, between
1999 and 2005, confirms as much in her witness statement
at paragraph 35.  The reference is WITN7293001.
To conclude in this segment, sir, there are two 
   119submissions that we make.  Firstly, the UK Government,
from the moment it unilaterally decided to increase
payments made by EIBSS, without providing funding to the
other support schemes, acted in a way that discriminated
on the grounds of nationality.  It always accepted that
it was responsible for making HIV payments, but it paid
more to those who lived in England than the rest of the
United Kingdom.  That was a wholly unjustifiable
difference in treatment.
Secondly, the UK Government acted in an underhanded
way in making the announcement it did in 2019 without
giving any notice to the Governments of Wales and
Northern Ireland, in much the same way it did in 2017
when the schemes were established.
It acted in an underhanded way by stating that the
increase was to be funded from the existing DHSC budget,
so that there would be no consequential funding for the
devolved governments.  As Vaughan Gething put it, it
essentially found the money down the back of the
departmental sofa.  It failed to do the right thing and
resolve the disparity in payments for almost two years.
As it was put by Vaughan Gething in a letter to the
UK Minister for Care on 9 October 2019, and the
reference is WITN5665004, he said this:
"This was very disappointing, given that this 
   120problem pre-dates devolution.  And the letter of 23 July
gave reassurance that there would be creation of an
equitable share in funding to provide parity across the
four UK support schemes."
Jeremy Hunt, the now Chancellor of the Exchequer,
stated that there should not have been a difference in
payments across the United Kingdom, but that the
UK Government did not have the ability to impose
a single scheme across the United Kingdom.
It's our submission that he was mistaken in saying
that.  Even if the support schemes were a devolved
matter -- and you'll be delighted to know, sir, I'm not
going to go into that thorny question, but even if they
were a devolved matter, the UK Government could seek
consent of the devolved governments to establish
a UK-wide scheme in two ways.  Firstly, the ability of
the UK Parliament to legislate in devolved areas is
unfettered, although it would not normally do so without
the consent of the Senedd -- so that's all that's
required -- or the Scottish Parliament, or in relation
to Northern Ireland.  And that's -- in respect of Wales,
that's section 107(5) of the Government of Wales Act
2006.
Secondly, the Governments of Wales and Northern
Ireland are able to delegate their functions to the                
    121UK Government, and the power to do so is in section 83
of the Government of Wales Act 2006, section 93 of the
Scotland Act 1998, and section 28 of the
Northern Ireland Act 1998.
Thus, our firm submission is that both the
compensation framework and the continued support schemes
should be established on a UK-wide basis.  There is
power to do so even if it's a devolved matter.  It would
be for the four nations to decide whether it is in fact
a devolved matter or not, and what budgetary
consequences that has.
It follows that we take issue with the submission
made by David Johnston KC on behalf of the Scottish
Government that the support scheme should remain on
a four nation basis just to retain flexibility to make
different payments.  That difference in treatment should
never be allowed to happen again.
Further, our clients from Northern Ireland are
particularly concerned in relation to the continuation
of the scheme in Northern Ireland, because of the
interruption to government there.
Sir, that concludes my submissions in relation to
the first issue.
Moving now to the second issue, which is the failure
of the devolved health systems in Wales and 
   122Northern Ireland to achieve self-sufficiency.
I should begin this segment with a quotation from
the evidence of Professor Parapia to this Inquiry.
I will fairly read it out in summary form, otherwise the
transcript will be punctuated with questions.
We say this piece of evidence puts the decision
making of clinicians and regulators in context.
He said this:
"When we went to conferences, meetings and so on ...
directors that were most closely associated with
companies would stay in the conference hotels and have
five-star, et cetera, et cetera, and you could see that
they were -- then there were gradations and you could
see that as you went lower down the usage of Factor VIII
in numbers or type of centre you were, then you may have
to go into three-star or four-star hotels, and you could
see the dinners, et cetera, et cetera.  There was quite
a big difference on hospitality that people got ...
"The bigger -- the centres that were more -- were
nearer working with pharmaceutical companies and so on,
people who used more of the product had a lot of support
for their departments.  And there were individuals being
employed as consultants.  I know at least one who is
still working as a consultant to one of the
pharmaceutical companies.  There were research grants. 
   123There was all sorts of available monies from
pharmaceutical companies.
"... it's unfortunate, because I think even now
things haven't changed that much, although now they
would have to declare it.  And some things would be
unacceptable now ... if the gifts went above a certain
level ... it wouldn't be acceptable at all.  But at that
time, it was accepted practice.  It was normal practice.
"... some of them were the same directors who were
advising the Government ... there were reference
directors who were in committees that were ...
recommending.
"I mean, we wanted honest advice, and ... it sort of
made us think: ... is this purely unbiased or not?
I think it was unbiased ... I think we got very good
guidelines from UKHCDO but it wasn't pleasant visibly to
see people not declaring their interest, which they
would have to now.  They wouldn't be allowed to do it.
It would be scandalous.
"But at that time it seemed acceptable practice to
be a Reference Centre Director to be on committees that
recommended the use of Factor VIII, and they would be
the advisers to Government, and these are people who are
paid by the National Health Service, employed by the
National Health Service. 
   124"I felt sad for BPL that they were not able to
compete on an equal footing with multinational
companies."
So may I firstly deal with the attempts to achieve
self-sufficiency or rather the adoption of the policy of
self-sufficiency on a UK-wide basis.  I will do so at
a pace, if I may.
In March 1973, the Chief Medical Officer wrote to
all senior medical officers stating that planning was
required to achieve more domestic production of
concentrate to avoid very significant expenditure for
amounts bought in excess of immediate needs.  That's
DHSC0100005_033.
Then in December 1974, Lord Owen, the Minister for
Health, invested £500,000 in BPL and PFL.  In March 1975
the following year, the Regional Transfusion Directors
were seeking to persuade clinicians to accept a steadily
increasing supply of domestically produced concentrate.
It was noted that Regional Transfusion Directors did
not always see eye to eye with Haemophilia Centre
Directors over the treatment of haemophiliacs, as HCDs
wanted to implement home prophylaxis and treatment
programmes, whereas the present proposals were based
upon home treatment when a bleed occurs.
The reference for that, sir, is LDOW0000018.                
    125So it's clear that, even as of 1975, the battle
lines were drawn between the RTDs and HCDs as to what
self-sufficiency meant.
Dr Foster confirmed in his evidence that PFC could
have fractionated plasma from England and Wales and
could have fractionated around a third of the plasma
from England and Wales.  He disputed Dr Lane's
contention that the capacity of PFC was exaggerated.
Dr Robert Perry told the Inquiry that there may have
been some merit in a joint approach for the development,
production and supply of plasma products on a UK-wide
basis.
In the event, BPL fractionated about 90 per cent of
plasma for the UK, and PFC about 10 per cent, whereas it
should have been in the order of 50/50.
Thus, in our submission, by the end of 1975 the
position was: firstly, the DHSS had adopted a policy of
self-sufficiency in concentrates, based on the known
risk of non-A, non-B transmission associated with
imported concentrate. 
Secondly, the CMO had set up a working party to
address the issue and the DHSS had invested £500,000 in
PFC and appreciated that the health economics indicated
that it was financially prudent to invest more money in
achieving self-sufficiency rather than purchasing 
   126expensive imports.
Thirdly, the DHSS and the CMO appreciated that the
freedom of clinicians to purchase imported concentrates
for home treatment programmes needed to be managed,
whilst fractionation capacity at BPL was increased and
arrangements with PFC were put in place, hence the
reference to seeking to persuade clinicians to accept
a gradually increasing amount.
Then, fourthly, notwithstanding that knowledge, no
additional money was invested to achieve
self-sufficiency.  No arrangements were put in place at
PFC and no steps were taken to suppress the increasing
demand by clinicians for imported concentrates.
In January 1981, Mr Meakins from the School of
Pharmacy and Pharmacology at the University of Bath
wrote in The Times about the fact that PFC was not being
used by the DHSS.  That's CBLA0001229.
He stated that the insufficiency of blood products
in the UK was largely self-imposed by bureaucracy and
that because the Health Departments for England, Wales
and Scotland are independent, blood is not sent north
across the border, and he stated:
"In my view this state of affairs is nothing less
than scandalous on the current efficiency situation,
which is disadvantageous to both patients and the 
   127taxpayer."
So the problem is there to be seen in 1981.
Then in 1982, the DHSS decided to invest in BPL and
to have the PFC focus on Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The reference for that is DHSC0001674.  Of course by
then Northern Ireland had entered into an agreement with
the Scottish Home and Health Department for the
fractionation of plasma from Northern Ireland, which
I will return to shortly, thereby entrenching the
artificial division in fractionation to the disadvantage
of patients.
May I now move on to look at the devolution
dimension in respect of self-sufficiency, but the
UK-wide decisions provide the context.
Now, in respect of Cardiff Regional Transfusion
Centre, there is no evidence that any steps were taken
by the Welsh Office to enter into arrangements with PFC
for the fractionation of Welsh blood to remove the
expenditure of the Cardiff RTC on imported concentrate
and there is no evidence that the Chief Medical Officer
for Wales took any steps to reduce the growing level of
demand for imported concentrates.
Dr Tony Napier, the Regional Transfusion Director
for Cardiff from 1977, agreed that it was open to him to
take his own action and that he tried to work with other 
   128RTDs.  He stated that the issue of self-sufficiency was
not a matter of great debate locally.  He admitted that
he was aware of the possibility of sending plasma to PFC
but that he didn't consider it.  Had he been aware that
there was a cap on the amount of Welsh plasma that BPL
could fractionate, he would have considered sending
plasma to PFC.
Ultimately, he accepted that he did not discuss
self-sufficiency with the Welsh Office.  He stated that
had Cardiff RTC been resourced to produce the requisite
amount of plasma, then it could have been
self-sufficient and, in that event, it was likely that
the worst of the HIV transmission could have been
avoided in Wales -- in South Wales, because South Wales
was supplied by Cardiff.
We are grateful to counsel to the Inquiry for their
recent presentation on decision making in Wales.  What
it demonstrates, in our submission, in particular by
reference to the evidence of Lord Barry Jones, who was
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Welsh
Office between 1974 and 1979, is that, insofar as the
DHSS took major responsibility, then the detail of
blood, blood products, haemophilia, other bleeding
disorders and hepatitis would have been within the
purview of senior civil servants in Cardiff.                
    129However, he did not recollect making any decisions
on blood policy.  He also explained that it was
a principal necessity for the Chief Medical Officer for
Wales to inform either the Minister's officials, or
possibly the Minister directly, about the risks
associated with blood and blood products and that the
Chief Medical Officer certainly had responsibility for
issuing guidance, advice or instructions to clinicians.
I will come shortly to a meeting with the Welsh
Office and Professor Bloom where that didn't happen.
But before I do, I'd like to turn to Northern Ireland.
Dr Morris McClelland, the RTD for Belfast,
consciously formulated a plan for self-sufficiency in
relation to Factor VIII.  He accepted that the purpose
of the arrangements at PFC was to achieve
self-sufficiency in Northern Ireland.  The reference is
RHSC0000076, at page 34.  The Health Board, that's the
Eastern Health and Social Services Board, became
involved on the issue of self-sufficiency and blood
products.  He had regular meetings with Dr Mayne because
of the rising costs of concentrate.  The Health Board
wanted to understand how the costs may be contained and
they played a coordinating role between supply and
demand.  He tried to discourage Dr Mayne from purchasing
imported concentrates.  He failed. 
   130An agreement in principle was reached with the
Scottish National Blood Transfusion Centre in
February 1981.  That's CBLA0001388.  But due to delays
caused by the capacity of the Belfast RTC to carry out
the required testing, the agreement was not implemented
until April 1982, that's CBLA0001572.  Dr McClelland
wrote to Dr Bridges in 1984, NIBS0001719.  In that
letter he stated that PFC was fractionating all the
fresh frozen plasma sent by Northern Ireland so that
they were self-sufficient in Factor VIII.  It seems that
the only product they were not self-sufficient in was
albumin.
The letter does note, however, that the demand at
the Royal Victoria Hospital had doubled -- doubled -- in
1983 from 1982.  In evidence, Dr McClelland confirmed
that they were not using 100 per cent PFC Factor VIII
because demand was increasing rapidly.
Thus, in distinction to the position in Cardiff RTC,
the story of Belfast RTC is that they did have an RTD
and a Health Board with the foresight and desire to
achieve self-sufficiency in 1981, but the plan was
poorly executed in two ways.  Firstly, a lack of
investment meant that Belfast RTC could not carry out
the required screening, which delayed the implementation
of the agreement and, secondly, no adequate control was 
   131exerted over Dr Mayne's purchase of increasing amounts
of commercial concentrate because, as explained by
Dr McClelland, blood products were procured and supplied
directly to the Haemophilia Centre.  But the cost came
out of the NIBTS budget.
We're also grateful to Counsel to the Inquiry for
the recent presentation on decision making in Northern
Ireland.  It demonstrates, in our submission, that
Sir Richard Needham, the Health Minister with
responsibility for blood from 1985 until 1989, had no
recollection of dealing with blood during his time at
the Health Minister.  He blamed this on the Troubles and
his far reaching portfolio.
Lord King, who was the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland, also denied any recollection of
dealing with blood.  The gist of their evidence is that
Northern Ireland followed the policy lead of the UK
Government on health.  However, that is problematic
because we know that the Department of Health and Social
Services in Northern Ireland reached an agreement to
send plasma to Scotland for fractionation, and the fact
that the Department was involved is shown by
CBLA0001388.
It may have been the position that Dr Mayne was the
main protagonist, and that the Health Board played 
   132a coordinating role.  But the Department was involved.
It was not following the policy lead of the UK
Government.
At paragraph 17(b) of the presentation, it refers to
Jack Scott not being altogether happy at Dr Mayne's
treatment policy in relation to SNBTS Factor VIII.  He
wasn't happy that it was being given preferentially to
those already on treatment with it, with the rest being
treated by commercial concentrate.  However, it does not
seem, from the available material, that Mr Scott ever
acted upon his displeasure at Dr Mayne continuing to use
commercial concentrate.
Lord John Patten, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary
in the Northern Ireland Office between January 1981 and
June 1983, told the Inquiry that when he was in Northern
Ireland, at a crucial time for the purposes of this
Inquiry, he did not recall seeing a single submission on
blood and blood products, even though he was responsible
for Health and Social Services.
Thus the evidence in Northern Ireland seems to be
that those with responsibility for decision making
didn't make any decisions, save to the extent that the
agreement was reached with Scotland.  There was nobody
providing direction at a crucial time in Northern
Ireland.                
    133Sir, may I make a brief comment on an element
contained in the oral submissions of Mr Aldworth, King's
Counsel, to the effect that the document retrieval
exercise in Northern Ireland had been, in his words,
"successful".  We say that's a rather odd way of putting
it.  There is still a marked dearth of evidence in
relation to Northern Ireland, as the concluding remarks
of counsel to the Inquiry's presentation allude to.
The remark that no evidence of document destruction
had been found also faces the difficulty that any
evidence of ill-motivated document destruction is also
likely to have been destroyed.
There was a meeting between the DHSS, the Scottish
Home and Health Department, the Welsh Office and the
Northern Ireland Office to discuss self-sufficiency in
February 1981, and that's DHSC0000064.  I won't bring it
on screen for reasons of time and I will summarise it.
It was agreed that, although BPL were currently
supplying England, Wales and Northern Ireland, PFC could
play a role in meeting the needs of the United Kingdom.
It was identified that PFC had the potential to meet
around 50 per cent of the UK's requirements for blood
products.  At paragraph 11 it was suggested that BPL
fractionated Welsh plasma and would presumably continue
to do so.  So it was not revisited; it was presumed that 
   134that arrangement would continue.
It may be appropriate for the Welsh Office to
contribute towards the redevelopment of BPL and,
similarly, if PFC fractionated Northern Ireland plasma,
it may be appropriate for the Northern Ireland Office to
contribute towards the costs of running PFC.
Thus, in our submission, the possibility of
different countries having their plasma fractionated at
either BPL or PFC was expressly considered at this
meeting, but what does not appear to have been
considered on any evidence available to this Inquiry is
the possibility of Welsh plasma being fractionated at
PFC at any point up until BPL was finally redeveloped in
the late 1980s, by which point it was too late to
mitigate the effects of HIV or hepatitis C on
haemophiliacs in Wales.
In terms of the UK Government's attitude towards the
NHS in Wales and Northern Ireland, Lord Kenneth Clarke
told the Inquiry he did not remember any meetings with
the Welsh Office or the Northern Ireland Office.
David Mellor told the Inquiry that there was no time
to discuss decisions with his counterparts in the four
nations and liaison was left to permanent secretaries
and civil servants.  Dr Rejman stated that he did not
have regular meetings with officials from the four 
   135nations and that was normally left to administrators.
He said that the exchange of information was also
done by the administrators.  He confirmed that there was
no system or process in place by which medical advice
was shared across the four nations.  Often, it occurred
to the DHS late to notify the four nations of
developments.  He confirmed that the health departments
of the four nations were smaller, so that the medical
officers in those departments had a much wider role than
haematology, so that they relied on the work done by the
DHSS, and the policy decisions would come from the DHSS.
In our submission, there are three problems with
that evidence.  Firstly, the exchange of information
could only be done on the administrative side in respect
of matters with which this Inquiry is concerned, if the
medical officers told the administrators what
information to exchange.  Secondly, it can be seen from
the limited documents available in respect of the Welsh
Office and the Northern Ireland Office that they did not
take policy instruction from Whitehall but made their
own policy decisions which would be unreasonable, if not
based on all relevant information, and that was
dependent on the medical officers in the UK Government
sharing all relevant information with the medical
officers in the Welsh Office and the Northern Ireland 
   136Office.
Thirdly the safe production of blood products in the
UK is something that should have been considered on
a four nations basis, given that the Welsh Office, the
Northern Ireland Office and the Secretary of State for
the Home Department -- the Scottish Home and Health
Department, sorry -- were responsible for blood in their
respective countries.
So what you effectively had was an administrative
devolution of responsibility for policy making and
implementation, but an overreliance on information being
given by the medical officers in the UK Government, but
then the medical officers on Dr Rejman's evidence were
not meeting regularly with the medical officers in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
So the system was topsy-turvy.
Rather, it seems to be the position that it was
assumed that the Welsh Office and the Northern Ireland
Office would follow suit.  But that was inappropriate
because they had the advantages of being smaller and of
self-sufficiency being a more realistic prospect.
Indeed, Northern Ireland did not follow England's lead
and decided to pursue a policy of self-sufficiency of
its own.  In Wales, the issue was simply not addressed
by those with the power to take decisions and the                
    137responsibility to do so.
The Public Health Administration Expert Group made
it clear that the Secretary of State for Health and
Social Services was not responsible for health in Wales,
Northern Ireland or Scotland.  They identified
a complication in that Wales and England were integrated
for the purpose of some legislation and high level
policy.  They commented that the lack of documentation
in relation to decisions being made in Wales and
Northern Ireland on blood policy may be attributable to
the fact that the Secretary of State for Wales and the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland were not
dedicated to health but had a wider policy portfolio.
They were unsurprised by the evidence of the
ministers in the Department of Health and Social
Services that they had little dialogue with their
counterparts in the four nations, as this was
a reflection of the Anglo-centric approach of the
Department of Health and Social Services.
They identified that the missed opportunity was not
creating a National Blood Transfusion Service that made
the most of both BPL and PFC.  The devolution problem,
it seems, compounded matters as there was a failure to
recognise that there were different systems in place.
I move now to address the exponential increase in 
   138the use of imported concentrates and how this impacted
upon the policy of self-sufficiency.
Sir, I note the time, it is 3.15.  Would you like to
take a break or would you like me to continue?

--Result #889--
   Thank you, sir.  I had reached the fifth of my
ten sections.  This is entitled "The transfusion of
blood".
Much of the investigation which was undertaken by
the Inquiry and the focus of its oral hearings have been
on the causes and effects of the blood contamination
disaster on those who suffered from bleeding disorders.
By far the most numerous group of infected and, 
   110hence, affected people is amongst those who acquired
their infection by blood transfusion.  In our
submission, sir, we recognise that there are perhaps
difficulties relating to the identification of themes
and trends and systemic failures in the transfusion
community, given the diversity of circumstances in which
people were infected.
However, our conclusion, which is to be found at
section I of our written submissions, is that a number
of important themes emerge.
I should say, sir, that the tenacity of the campaign
led by those predominantly from the bleeding disorder
community and the disparate nature of the circumstances
of the transfusion infections has, in our submission,
led to them often having no ready-made association or
means of organisation.
On occasions, this has meant that the plight of
those who are infected by transfusion is being
marginalised in the media or by Government.  In our
submission, this must stop.  They have suffered similar
consequences and they have been exposed to the same
tragedy.
As regards the transfusion infections, we argue that
a careful analysis of the available evidence does allow
clear conclusions to be drawn.  Our analysis of the 
   111evidence concludes that the deficiencies in the way in
which blood services operated in Scotland caused
multiple unnecessary infections with both HCV and HIV.
The evidence to which I referred earlier presented
to the Inquiry by the statistics group shows that this
had a real effect and caused unnecessary infection.
The group commented specifically on the fact that
the number of HIV infections from transfusion in
Scotland was disproportionately high when compared with
the rest of the UK.  Dr Gillon, who carried out the
Scottish HIV look-back in that community, explained to
the Inquiry that this was likely to be a minimum number
of infections, namely 18, caused by that route.
There are, of course, limitations of the look-back
procedure in general and we suggest in our submission
that the fact that it's reliant on repeat donors may
well mean that that number is, in fact, higher.
In our submission, sir, the number of HIV infections
in that community indicates the effect of the poor blood
collection and processing practices to which I have
already made reference.  This is supported by the
evidence available in the Crawford paper from 1991 and
the statistical analysis undertaken by your statistics
expert group, which suggests that, in the HCV
population, there was a higher rate of infectivity in 
   112donors in Scotland.
Although this will in part lead you to the fact that
there was a higher infectivity in the general community,
based, in their assessment, on higher rates of
intravenous drug use, Mr Bowie accepted that there had
been insufficient efforts to exclude those donors and,
in our submission, these higher rates of infection
result directly from the practices which I have already
outlined.
We have also, in our submissions, sir, conducted
an analysis of documentation relating to transfusion
practice, by which I mean the actual delivery of the
blood transfusions.  These reveal that blood was
transfused unnecessarily and, at times, the profligate
use of blood and blood components in Scotland was
evident during the period of infective risk.
The evidence presented by our clients also reveals
that blood was generally transfused with little or no
regard to the views of patients.  Informed consent about
risks or reasonable alternatives, frankly did not
feature at all.
You will recall, sir, the evidence given by both
Dr Keel and Dr McClelland about a much later initiative
to try to regulate the use of blood in Scotland, in
particular, you may recall Dr McClelland speaking about                
    113his surprise that he found a cardiac surgeon -- I think
in Portugal -- who was able to carry out certain
procedures without using any blood at all.  But those
processes, sir, which took place many years later are
indicative of the fact that the system had been
profligate for many years, that unnecessary transfusions
were given, the practice of top ups, which we heard
about across the country, was also a feature of the
Scottish evidence and that, therefore, risk of infection
was increased unnecessarily.
We have also, sir, conducted an analysis of the
look-back in relation to HCV.  As I have already
mentioned, the practical impediments which were
identified by Mr Cory-Wright with regard to the
difficulties which the predecessor of NHSBT had, in
knowing what happened to the blood that they collected,
were not impediments which generally existed within
Scotland.
Dr Keel, when asked about look-back, pointed to the
West of Scotland, where she illustrated the difficulties
in this regard by the fact that the West of Scotland
Transfusion Centre was situated at Law Hospital in
Lanarkshire, rather than in a hospital.
It was interesting, in our submission, that she
chose that particular example because that was the only 
   114one of the transfusion centres in Scotland which was not
effectively based in a hospital and Dr Gabra, who spoke
on behalf of that service, made it clear that one of the
first tasks with which he was charged when being engaged
by the service was to improve the connections with
hospitals.
As a result, therefore, sir, our conclusion is that
the transfusion service could and should have done more
both to advise those using blood in transfusion in
hospitals as to its risks but also the suggestion of
there being practical impediments to the look-back were
in fact illusory, prevented only by poor practice in
record keeping and the Government's culpable
unwillingness to find those who might blame them for
their fate.
Dr Gillon was, of course, the king of the look-back
in Scotland.  He stressed the important advantages of
doing look-back as near as possible at the time, which
was why he felt the HIV look-back conducted by him in
the mid-'80s was perhaps more reliable than the HCV
which he did not undertake until later in the '90s.
Delay was predictably fatal to the utility of the
project, which was already limited in its scope due to
its reliance on repeat donors and the considerable
limitations of record keeping.  As a result, many 
   115infected patients in Scotland were lost.
Epidemiological analysis undertaken by the statistics
group estimates that at least 2,500 were infected with
HCV in this community.  The approach was, in our
submission, redolent of an insurance company seeking to
minimise its financial liability, rather than the state
in a democratic society with its clear legal and moral
obligations to protect those individuals whom it has
infected.
The effects of this indifference are plain, we say,
from the evidence you have heard.  The Inquiry heard
from those who were not found.  One client of ours, sir,
I must unfortunately inform you, who gave evidence, who
was from this community has -- who gave oral evidence in
2019 has since passed away.  The Inquiry also heard from
those who were found.  Many have told in their evidence
of the matter of fact way in which they were informed,
with no apparent realisation that many of them had had
no reason to have any contact with health services and
no ready made place to go for help.
They were thrust into a world of liver clinics
populated by those who had been infected by IV drug use
or other means.  They were regularly stigmatised and
traumatised by medical staff who assumed they were drug
users or alcoholics, many did so completely alone, 
   116thinking unnecessarily they were the only ones to have
suffered this unimaginable fate.
Sir, before moving on, on the subject of look-back,
I would also like to draw your attention to another
couple of elements of it.  Although, of course, the main
thrust of our arguments about the failures of look-back
relate to the failures in finding people who were
infected by transfusion, the evidence in Scotland
suggests that, during the course of the Scottish
Executive Investigation in and around 2000, Drs Ludlam
and Lowe brought to the attention of the investigating
civil servant, Dr Keel, that there may, in fact, be
people from the bleeding disorder community, mostly mild
patients, who may have been infected who were not
traced.
We have drawn attention, sir, in our submission to
a meeting in 2000 where this happened.  Our
understanding is that, despite those warnings, no
efforts were made until many years later to locate those
individuals.
Indeed, Dr Keel in her oral evidence was taken to
another place where Dr Ludlam had, at one stage,
attempted to inform the state that there were possibly
infected individuals who had not been found.  Dr Ludlam
pointed out that there were patients who had received                
    117Scottish Factor IX concentrate for medical matters other
than bleeding disorders.
In her evidence, remarkably, Dr Keel suggested that
such patients may number in the tens of thousands.  Some
of those will have been exposed to Factor IX concentrate
before heat treatment of the product in October 1985.
No efforts appear to have been made to find them.
Sir, I am moving on to my sixth topic now, which is
what we call "The domino effect, patients as people and
as pioneers".
Like Mr Snowden, our extensive review of the
evidence available to the Inquiry from our clients is
that not a single one spoke to having been advised of
the risk of viral infection from blood or blood
products.  In our submission, we present an analysis not
only of the ethical guidance of today but the
long-standing ethical guidance of the time.  The lack of
informed consent to treatment and testing, the failure
to inform patients of their diagnosis and to provide
anything like adequate support to them when they did
find out, represents in our submission a system-wide
abrogation of the state's ethical responsibilities to
patients on what, to my knowledge, is an unprecedented
scale.
It should, in our view, be borne in mind that many 
   118of the patients infected were not infected in acute
situations, though some were.  The long-term care of
bleeding disorders and other chronic conditions which
required transfusion, as well as elective surgery and
the ability to plan and approach obstetric emergencies,
lent themselves to patient interaction and careful
planning in the interests of safety and autonomy.  This
simply did not happen.
In a written submission we describe in some detail,
based largely on a wide review of the evidence from the
Scottish community, of a kind of domino effect from not
telling the patients about the risks involved in
treatment, which is apparent from the evidence.
Having not been involved in decision-making at the
start, that locked the clinicians into a position.  They
committed to the products being safe; in some places,
like Edinburgh, despite direct questioning to that
effect by the patient.
That then led to difficulties in revealing other
matters, such as the fact that patients were involved in
research or that risks had begun to emerge.  It created
difficulties with informing patients about the fact they
were being tested.  Why would they be being tested if
they had been told the products were safe?
Once the terrible reality of infection became 
   119apparent, it was obviously difficult for doctors to
reveal that reality to patients.  However, it was done
completely inadequately.  The December 1984 meeting in
Edinburgh, to which my learned friend Mr Bowie made
reference, represents the ham-fisted attempts of
a medical community trying to deal with the terrible
reality of their patients' infections against
a background of them having failed in the first place to
inform the patients about the risks.
Sir, one thing I would like to point out which is of
some significance to us is that in this regard one sees
in many documents, both from factual witnesses and from
those who are assessing that evidence, the reference to
the concept of paternalism.  This is a good example,
sir, of the phenomenon I described earlier of the
medical profession simply seeking to say that something
happened across the board, and therefore it was
acceptable.
Paternalism, sir, might be described as thinking or
behaviour by people in authority that results in them
making decisions for other people that, although they
may be to those people's advantage, prevent them from
taking responsibility for their own lives.
It seems to be trotted out as a party line,
a defence against allegations of widespread ethical 
   120breaches in this area, as if the defence of "we all did
it" in the pre- Bolitho era is a good one.  In our
submission, sir, although there is a similarity between
the words "paternalism" and -- "paternalistic" and
"paternal", the two things are quite different.
Paternalistic -- obviously they come from the word
"pater" in Latin, meaning father.  Paternalistic relates
to the authoritative element of a father.  However, in
essence, in our view, paternalism is and was unethical.
There was nothing paternal about the way in which many
of our clients were treated.  In our submission, sir,
there was unethical medical practice revealed on a large
scale.
In this regard, sir, although I suggested that
I don't intend to make reference to the conclusions of
the Penrose Inquiry, I think I need to.  The conclusions
of the Penrose Inquiry in this regard are, in our
submission, instructive as to the importance of this
area and certain pitfalls that need to be avoided.
The Inquiry was assisted in this regard by two
expert witnesses, namely Professor Nathanson and
Professor Hay, former Chair of the UKHCDO from whom this
Inquiry also heard.  Although the latter was not
a clinician who worked in Scotland, he was, in our view,
clearly not an independent witness.                
    121In paragraph 32 of the report, the position which is
adopted or accepted generally by the Penrose Inquiry is
that before 1988 there effectively were no ethical rules
relating to the matters to which I've made submissions.
It suggested that the conduct of medicine before that
time was a kind of ethical Wild West, where there were
no rules to which adherence could be expected.  In our
view this approach is flawed.  It is not consistent with
the evidence of guidance at the time.  It conflates
factual evidence with a lack of regard for patient
autonomy, with the separate issue of what the ethical
approach ought to have been.  The evidence before this
Inquiry, as others have suggested, constitutes a clear
basis on which contemporary ethical standards were
institutionally disregarded.
This applies to all types of patients in our
submission and is a sound basis for the conclusion to be
reached that there was a moral duty from the state to
its patients which was breached in relation to informed
consent, testing and other matters.
As a result, sir, it is an important part of our
argument that there is a moral duty for the state to pay
compensation in this regard.
Sir, I have already touched on research to a certain
extent but I do feel, as it is an important matter to 
   122many of my clients, that I would like to say something
further about it.
I do so, in particular, in regard to an observation
made by the NHS Scotland submission, which I feel I have
to address.  The suggestion made by Mr Bowie in his
written and obviously referred to in his oral
submission, is that one of my clients in her evidence
suggested that there had been deliberate infection of
patients in Edinburgh with HIV.
In our submission, sir, we make it clear that this
is not our assertion.  We present a detailed analysis
which leads to the conclusion that the Edinburgh
patients, those who are still alive, formed the view, in
our submission quite reasonably, based on an extensive
analysis of evidential material that became available to
them after the event that it was possible that something
had happened to that effect.
They do not assert that it did but it is, in our
position, important to realise that a significant part
of the compounding of their harms has been based on the
fact that they were, throughout the relevant period,
kept in the dark when they asked for explanations they
did not receive them and, in circumstances where
an extensive evidential search was done by one of my
clients, Mrs Mackie, who also gave evidence to the 
   123Inquiry, she reached the view, in our submission, quite
reasonably that that may have happened.
Sir, I won't get into the detail of that today but
there is a very detailed analysis of the reason why, in
our submission, she and her husband and many others were
driven to that conclusion.
Research in Edinburgh, and not exclusively in
Edinburgh because a significant amount of research also
took place in Glasgow, was an essential part of the
system of the treatment of haemophiliacs.  My client,
Mr Norval, asked the question at the end of his
evidence, "What are haemophiliacs for?"  It would be
impossible, in my view, to come to the conclusion that
research undertaken on haemophiliacs, who willingly
offer up their arms and their blood, in their evidence,
for the checking of their factor levels, have not been
subject to research on a grand scale.
In his submission to the Inquiry, Mr Cummins, in
relation to the treatment of the boys at Treloar's, said
that his clients had come to the view, based on the
evidence examined by this Inquiry, that research had
been undertaken on them which was not in their interests
but for the interests of others.
I can well imagine why they have reached that
conclusion and the same conclusion has been reached by 
   124those who were involved in research in Scotland.
The Edinburgh research agenda, sir, started almost
as soon as Dr Ludlam arrived.  A letter was written to
Dr Craske by Dr Ludlam on 28 April 1980, shortly after
his arrival at the centre.  The reference is
LOTH0000031_027.
In the interests of time, sir, I'm just going to
refer to its text.  The context of this is Dr Craske
inviting Dr Ludlam to become part of a working party on
hepatitis, and this is the reply.  He says:
"Dear Dr Craske, thank you for your letter of
28 March, I apologise for the delay in replying but
I was away the first half of April and since returning
several of the people I wanted to consult before
replying to all the points in your letter I now find are
away in Edinburgh for the next week or two.  Since it is
a month since you wrote I thought I should commit as
best I can for now and give a more definitive reply
shortly.
"Thank you for your invitation to serve on the
working party.  I am very happy to accept your kind
offer.  Like most clotologists, most of my training has
been in the treatment of haemophilia from the bleeding
point of view and I have relatively little knowledge of
hepatology.  This, however, is obviously an increasingly                
    125important area.  I am anxious to learn and I hope I may
be of some help to the project.
"I am very conscious of the almost unique group of
haemophiliacs we have in Edinburgh because they have
never received commercial concentrate.  They are
therefore, as you are aware, useful material for
a variety of studies in relation to liver disease.
There are various pressures working against keeping our
patients free of non-NHS concentrate but I am doing my
utmost to resist these.  I think that the liver biopsy
project is very worthwhile and I hope to be able to
contribute patients to this."
Sir, in our submission, this forms important context
to the breakdown in relationships between the Edinburgh
patients and their consultant, Dr Ludlam.  The unique
circumstances of the Edinburgh group went on, of course,
to become why it was that they were described as one of
the most extensively studied group of HIV-infected
individuals in the world.
The research which has been undertaken is, in our
submission, instructive about the causes of infection
and other matters which are relevant to the Inquiry's
remit.  They reveal that infection with concentrates in
Edinburgh was more likely to occur in circumstances
where people were exposed to more product.  As I have 
   126already said, in the period under examination, the
amount of product used compared to the second half of
the 1960s rose by six times.

--Result #890--
   Sorry, compared to the second half of the 1970s
rose by six times.  That is correct, sorry, sir.
The position, sir, therefore, is that, as a result
of the information becoming available to patients
subsequent to infection, the role of research has, in my
submission, become quite reasonably part of their
analysis of what the motivation was for why they became
infected.
As the boys from Treloar's have put it, my clients
have become of the view that extensive research in the
interests of others was prioritised over their safety.
They continued to be exposed to concentrates, which the
immune studies in 1983 showed were harmful, if not
infective, they showed that they affected immune
function and, therefore, exposed patients to greater
risk.  Despite this, sir, the study continued and, in my
submission, the conclusions which were reached by those
who researched the position, having been left in
ignorance by their consultant, were entirely reasonable.
These concerns were added to, sir, by the way in
which the December 1984 meeting was handled.  You will 
   127remember, sir, Mr Bowie accepted, quite rightly, in our
view, that the way in which that had been handled was
unacceptable and, on that particular occasion, my
recollection was that his clients, Lothian Health Board,
I assume, accepted corporate responsibility for the
failure to engage in that.
A general point I would make in that regard, sir,
one I have made already, is it is slightly odd, it seems
to me, that they would accept corporate responsibility
for that but not other things but the concession is
appreciated.
You are aware, sir, that in the aftermath of that
meeting, patients having reasonably arrived at the
conclusion that they must not be infected, otherwise why
would the possibility of infection have been revealed to
them in those unusual and unacceptable circumstances,
that an advice leaflet was sent to the patients.  That
advice leaflet can be found at PRSE0002785 and the
particular page is the final page, which is_0003.
The final page of the advice sheet sent to the
patients in early 1985 contains the statement that "As
of now, all Factor VIII concentrate is being heat
treated to destroy the virus.  You will be given
heat-treated Factor VIII as soon as possible".  It also
has a final paragraph entitled "Reassurance", which 
   128includes the paternalistic expression, which Mr Bowie
referred to, that "Patients must continue to treat
themselves with concentrates".
This, of course, is a big part of the reason why
those who received the letter thought they were
uninfected.  Why would this good news be portrayed to
a patient if he were already infected, the clear
inference was that they had dodged the bullet.
However, sir, the position on the heat-treated
concentrates was stated clearly and unequivocally.
Mrs Mackie, whose evidence is referred to by my learned
friends, was aware that for this to be said with any
scientific accuracy, it would have needed to have been
tried on living patients.  It was not until Dr Foster
gave evidence to this Inquiry that it became apparent it
was, in fact, accepted at that time that that statement
was not accurate, that it was not known that the heat
treatment would be successful to destroy the virus
because it had not yet been tested on living patients.
That, sir, is the specific context of the allegation
or the suggestion made by my learned friends about
Mrs Mackie's evidence.  In my submission, she has not
said that people were deliberately infected.  However,
she has said with some force and relevance that she and
her husband and many others were quite reasonably driven                
    129to that conclusion.  The specification with which she
came up with the theory about the heat treatment trial,
which she referred to in her evidence, was merely
an expression of her belief that that may have happened
and, in my submission, that belief was quite reasonable,
based on the assurances given in the letter.
Sir, there is a detailed analysis in our submission
of the various elements of research, which obviously
I won't go into detail about today.  They are very
important, in my submission, both in understanding
elements of the circumstances in which people became
infected but in understanding the attitude of
indifference, it would seem, that treating clinicians
appear to have had to what Dr Ludlam described as
"useful material".
I have also included in our submission details of
other research beyond the research that I have talked
about already.  That being research related to liver
dysfunction, hepatitis, the immune function research in
both Edinburgh and Glasgow, and the ongoing research
into the effects of AIDS on the Edinburgh cohort
patients.
I would draw your attention also, sir, to the fact
that a number of family members of patients in Edinburgh
also, it would appear, were involved in research, both 
   130of the living members of the Edinburgh cohort have given
clear evidence about the fact that wider family members,
including those not genetically related to the infected
person had blood taken for research too.
It seems the "useful material" extended beyond the
patients to their families.
We would also draw your attention, sir, to the
submission we have made about one AIDS case arising from
the Yorkhill group, where, despite representation having
been made to the hospital after the boy's death to the
contrary effect, research on that boy continued even
after he had died.
Sir, my next section is entitled "Compounding the
harms".  In her oral statement, my learned friend
Ms Grey said that the evidence from the infected and
affected of the impact heard by the Inquiry spoke for
itself.  Mr Cory-Wright described the harms caused and
compounded as unimaginable.  Though we took them simply
to mean that this was a formidable body of evidence that
they did not seek to challenge, in our submission some
risks arise from the fact that this attitude is taken to
that body of evidence, of which we would like to make
the Inquiry aware.
We have a detailed section in our submission, which
is section D, which we have entitled "Impact". 
   131Although, sir, this may not need to be said, we think
that it is an essential part of the Inquiry's function
that its report should undertake a detailed analysis of
the consequences of the disaster for the infected and
affected, detailing the depth, the variety and intensity
of the harms, the breadth, the number and variety of
people whom it has affected, and the damage which it has
done.
Some inquiries, such as the Scottish Child Abuse
Inquiry, contain in their terms of reference a specific
requirement that the Inquiry create a public record of
the harms.  Sir, we would urge you to do the same.  The
failure of the state ever to undertake a proper
assessment of the harm, need or loss of the community
was a recurring feature of the evidence.  Your report,
sir, can remedy that at a community level.
In our submission, the variety and complexity of the
harms are required to be carefully analysed and
documented as a basis for what should be taken to be the
characteristic consequences of infection for the
purposes of the compensation scheme which we propose you
should recommend.
It is also important, sir, that the known or
understood to be acceptable effects of treatment for
those conditions should be chartered in the same way. 
   132That task, sir, I think will be considerably helped
by the useful summaries given at the end of the expert
group reports, in particular on hepatitis and HIV, where
they have sought to undertake that task.  Rather than
simply replicating what they have said, I would simply
refer you to that, sir, but also suggest that there are
a number of additional areas which the Inquiry might
consider, including in those lists, based on the
extensive evidence from the infected and affected about
consequences which they assert are associated either
with infection or with treatment.
Sir, there are a number of particular facets of the
evidence of impact to which I would like to make brief
reference.  First of all, as it arises particularly in
the client group which I represent, it is important in
our view to make a clear analysis in the report of the
extensive and devastating impacts of hepatitis C
infection.
A number of my clients have for many years fought
for recognition on an individual or collective basis of
the full extent of the harms which this deadly virus has
caused.  The concept of mono-infection which sometimes
one sees is not one which finds favour with my clients.
Given the propensity which this term has to lessen
a full recognition of the extent of the damage which                
    133this terrible virus can cause and its tendency to
suggest that those who have hepatitis C and not HIV are,
in some perverse way, the lucky ones.
Similarly, sir, it is our submission that the
Inquiry has available to it a particularly important
body of evidence.  That is the evidence which was given
by its psychosocial group.  Although, sir, I have made
reference to a number of important features arising out
of the expert group's evidence, I think it important to
bring to your attention, sir, that the analysis of this
group of the extent and effect of the psychological
harms visited on a vulnerable community when they went
to obtain their initial treatment was frankly exemplary
and should be reflected in the report.
The experience of listening to the evidence was of
great cathartic effect for a number of my clients.  One
must remember, sir, that many clients, due to the very
nature of the stigma and the harm suffered, lived for
years in isolation thinking they were the only ones who
had been affected in this way.
Many saw the expert group's analysis and recognised
themselves in the classes of victim and the types of
harm which were being described for the first time.  The
group's analysis of the severity of the impact on
the affected community was also a model of clarity. 
   134In this regard too we would refer you, sir, to the
importance of a clear exposition being given on the
extensive effects of stigma on the infected and affected
communities.  In itself stigma destroyed lives, in
particular where it was meted out by the NHS or the
state itself.  It is important that we don't look at
this simply as an add-on to the physical harms as, to be
frank, sometimes the law might.  Sir Robert Francis
recognised this in his report, creating a distinct head
of damages for stigma and associated loss, which in our
view was entirely appropriate.
Sir, another theme to which I would simply wish to
make brief reference is the theme of family.  In our
submission, family runs through the evidence which you
have heard.  You have heard, sir, from a number of
witnesses for whom the joyous occasion of the birth of
a child was subsequently impacted upon by the fact that
transfusions received at that time caused horrible
infection.  You have heard, sir, how the celebration of
new life would forever be associated with a disease
treatment which consigned the individual concerned to
living a life of infection rather than a life of joy.
Sir, you heard evidence from one particular client
of mine, Mrs Fyffe, who heard she received an infection
on the day of the birth of her child.  As a result of 
   135treatment she received from that infection, which caused
an autoimmune reaction, she has had after that point to
live her life effectively away from light.  On the very
day when life was created, light, the very essence of
life itself, was taken away.
You heard the familiar heartbreaking stories of
mothers, unwittingly having been the genetic source of
their son's haemophilia, who did all they could to
follow treatment regimes they were assured were best for
their boys.  You heard of the devastation when that
treatment took the lives of the boys away which they had
hoped to improve.
You heard from a father, Mr McDougall, who still,
30 years after his son's death from AIDS, contracted at
Yorkhill, cannot get to the end of a sentence without
breaking down.  Who would forget his emotional
recollection of the visits to his son's boat
Butterfly 23 after his death, still festooned with
decorations after his last birthday celebration, family
as it was meant to be, joyous celebration, tragically
juxtaposed with family cruelly and unnecessarily taken
away.
The Yorkhill Parents Group, a dedicated collection
of loving parents seeking to help their sons, went to
funeral after funeral as the boys passed away from AIDS. 
   136You heard from infected people about the devastation
arising from the hereditary nature of haemophilia.
Infections ravaged families, brothers and uncles and
nephews were infected together.  Often a tragic window
into one person's possible fate was the person standing
next to them or worse, being lowered into the ground.
You heard stories of family lost through stigma and
isolation.  You heard from widows about the
transformation and loss of their infected husbands.  You
heard from one individual, Mrs AD, who told the tale of
her son having to put his father, another victim of
AIDS, into a body bag as the undertaker would not touch
him.  You heard from one lady, Mrs Batters, whose
husband had been infected with HCV by transfusion, who
in turn had been infected by him.  He had died shortly
before she gave evidence to the Inquiry in 2019.  You
heard from the wife of a campaigner, Christine Norval,
who was scarcely able to contemplate the possibility
that this Inquiry may bring closure to her family.
You heard again, and again, sir, that, despite the
ravages of infection, the thing which preyed on the
minds of the infected the most, was the impact that
their infections, acquired through no fault of their own
had had on their loved ones and, above all else, the
Earth-shattering and lasting guilt which they felt about                
    137possibly, though unwittingly, having exposed their
family to danger too.  You heard from family members
also subjected to research at the hand of the state
alongside their infected loved ones.
Sir, the story of family is at the very heart of the
story of the disaster.
Sir, we also have, in our submission, an extensive
analysis of the way in which not only were harms caused
by infection and treatment but those harms have been
irrevocably and multiply compounded and increased by way
that the state has reacted.
The compounding of the harm, sir, is one of the most
important and unique factors of this disaster.  Unique
result of the evidence heard, in our submission, is that
the infected and affected have, unlike victims of other
medical disasters, suffered the consequences of multiple
wrongful acts on the part of the state.
Their complex, physical and psychological injuries
have been rendered all the more complex, a single
indivisible mass of harms with various forces and loss
all interacting with and compounding each other.
We urge you, sir, to reflect the uniqueness and
complexity of their situations as a result, in your
report.  Please pay heed to this: whatever the argument
about the avoidability of infections or their sequelae, 
   138the entirety of what compounded the harms was completely
avoidable.
I also, sir, as I have made reference to the
psychosocial report, refer you to the evidence given by
that group on 25 February 2020, in particular at
page 124, where Professor Weinman predominantly, and
also Ms Edwards gave powerful evidence, not simply their
own views, but based on literature, namely the Elder
paper and Southwick paper, which led Professor Weinman
to give the following account of the impacts of the
events that take place after medical disasters.  He
says:
"Again lack of accountability, a lack of
explanation, lack of apology, all those sorts of things
really emerged in that [meaning the papers] and the
effects on people, where 90 per cent of people talked
about serious emotional consequences and major financial
impacts as a result of all that happening."  
Sir, the impacts were huge, absolutely huge.
Ms Edwards went on to describe that there were a number
of significant behavioural consequences listed in the
literature, in that regard.
Sir, we think that the compounding of the harms is
a unique and important element of this disaster which
again we anticipate you will wish to reflect in your 
   139report.
The eighth section of my submission, sir, is
entitled "The myth of devolution".  I have touched on
a number of matters which arise under this section
already, when I talked about the advantages available to
the state in Scotland.
It is important to understand, in my submission,
sir, that there were a number of decisions which were
taken at the time when infections were occurring, which
were based on the parameters which pertained to
treatment and the balancing of risk, outwith Scotland,
which were then simply adopted and imposed upon
Scotland.
For example, the Inquiry heard evidence that
although the licensing legislation provided for the
Secretary of State for Scotland to be involved in
licensing matters, the licensing system operated through
Medicines Division in the Department of Health and was
not separate for Scotland.  Therefore, no separate
consideration was given for the need for imported
products to be licensed or used in Scotland.
As I have outlined, separate considerations in that
regard applied in Scotland.  Imported products were
unnecessary.  The products were admitted to Scotland on
the basis of non-Scottish considerations. 
   140Furthermore, sir, other decisions were regularly
taken in Scotland on advice issued to Government based
on what one might describe as non-Scottish
considerations.
The UKHCDO advice, in particular the Bloom advice in
May 1983, was based on the English position.  Guidelines
were issued as to treatment practices which were based
on the limitations of the English system to be able to
provide alternatives to commercial concentrate.
Dr Walford confirmed there was little or no contact
with other regional administrations, including the
Scottish Office.  As a result, no separate consideration
of the Scottish position was undertaken at government
level.
Similarly, the failure to introduce surrogate
testing anti-HIV and anti-HCV testing, due to the
perceived need to coordinate these matters with the rest
of the UK, showed the fallacy of administrative
devolution in healthcare in Scotland.  Things were not
analysed along Scottish lines.
In our written submission, we address and explain
something which we have called the "Cash dichotomy".
The phenomenon of Professor Cash apparently taking
contradictory positions on these matters.  In our view,
this was due to the inherent tension in his position.                
    141He knew that things could and should have been done in
Scotland earlier but felt the need to protect the
inherently dysfunctional national system.  He was the
living embodiment of the contradiction at the heart of
the system, a contradiction which rendered the system
unnecessarily safe in Scotland.
Furthermore, sir, there are a number of subsequent
examples of Scottish considerations not being looked at
and the English position simply being imposed.
You will remember, sir, the correspondence which
took place as a result of a solicitor acting for
a number of HIV patients in Scotland, a Mr Tyler, having
written to the then Secretary of State for Scotland
questioning why it was that there had been
an announcement that the HIV Litigation was to be
settled across the UK, without there having been any
consultation whatsoever with him or his clients.
The evidence showed that not only had there been no
consultation with Mr Tyler, there had been no
consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland
either.  As a result of that -- and the Inquiry, of
course, has looked at the detailed circumstances in
which the HIV Litigation came to be settled in
England -- the multiple litigations in Scotland, which
of course were conducted on a completely different basis 
   142because the Scottish system was different, were not
considered and the HIV Litigation settlement was foisted
upon the individuals who were litigants in Scotland.
Just another example of what we call the "myth of
devolution".
Sir, we refer in our submission -- the HIV
litigation is, of course, a matter of some importance in
its own regard.  However, in our submission, sir, the
HIV Litigation marks an important moment in the history
of the disaster for reasons other than its own intrinsic
significance.  You have heard significant evidence, sir,
about the groupthink, which emerged within government,
both at Westminster and within the Scottish Office and
subsequently in the Scottish Government, or the Scottish
Executive, after devolution.  That groupthink has its
origins somewhere.
The thought which becomes the adopted position
through a gradual process, in our submission, started at
the time of the HIV Litigation.
We have referred the Inquiry to a number of meetings
which took place in 1989 and 1990.  One is from 16 June
1989, the reference: PRSE0002656.  The other is the
12 February 1990, HCDO0000271_014.
You will remember these meetings, sir, they caught
our attention because, although they are both -- the 
   143first is a meeting of the UKHCDO directors, the second
a meeting of the UKHCDO AIDS subgroup, both involve
a particularly Scottish component.  Drs Ludlam and Lowe,
and indeed certain medical advisers from Scotland, are
involved considerably in the discussions.
It is important, sir, that you take some time to
consider the content of these meetings because, in our
submission, they are the origin of the groupthink which
set in and about which you have heard so much evidence.
The doctors effectively got together, came up with what
we have described as the party lines.  They were shared
with Government.  Government attended both of those
meetings and, in our submission, that is where one finds
the origin of what the Leigh Day representatives have
described of the defensiveness which we have also set
out in our submission.
Sir, there are a number of -- there is, in our
submission, also, a detailed examination of the period
after devolution.  It is important, in our submission,
that you take time to consider in some detail the
Scottish Executive Investigation which took place in
1999 and 2000.
Susan Deacon in her evidence, then Scottish Health
Minister in that administration, explained how, at the
time of devolution, there was a new hope that things 
   144would be able to be done differently.  She made it quite
clear that advice had been tendered to her by civil
servants consistent with the Government line, which
existed in Westminster and within the Scottish Office.
She explained that she was not prepared to accept
that advice and that the  prima facie  evidence available
to her suggested this was a matter that needed to be
looked at further, and so she did so and ordered
an investigation.
Our position, sir, is that that internal inquiry,
which was prompted by two petitions that were lodged
within the Scottish Parliament, one of which is entitled
petition PE45, which asked for a public inquiry and for
compensation for haemophilia victims of the disaster --
that inquiry, sir, was completely defective.
Despite the request having been for a public
Inquiry, instead, the internal inquiry focused on
negligence for some reason, which was a matter for the
courts, and not the moral responsibility and failings of
the state, which a public inquiry would have done.
The internal inquiry did not address anything like
the number of questions which campaigners had posed,
which a public inquiry could have done.  The internal
inquiry ran into trouble when the complexity and
multiplicities of the questions raised by the disaster                
    145became apparent, which a public inquiry could have coped
with.  The internal inquiry failed to engage with the
evidence or the allegations of the infected and affected
in anything more than a cursory fashion, which a public
inquiry could have done.
Most of all, sir, that investigation was not
independent, which a public inquiry would have been.
We go into some detail in that regard, sir, about
the fact that it was run by Dr Aileen Keel, from whom
the Inquiry heard evidence.  She was herself a previous
haemophilia clinician who explained that she had been
involved in the treatment, amongst other places, of the
boys at Yorkhill at the time they were being infected
with AIDS.  She was, of course, also a civil servant who
had been tainted by the very party line that
Susan Deacon had said she was so keen to resist.
In the end it is not surprising, in our view, that
many of the questions which were posed within the
investigation were found to have proven no negligence,
when the source of evidence which was looked at was
predominantly the very people within the medical
fraternity whose actions were being criticised.  We go
into some detail in that regard as well.
Sir, if I may simply again take you to one further
document -- I will not put it up, to save time -- the 
   146reference is SCGV0000170_152.  I think with this one it
might be worth putting it up because it is slightly
difficult to follow some of the text.
Just to explain the background, sir, this is a memo
on behalf of the First Minister of Scotland, then
Donald Dewar, written we think by a civil servant to
Ms Falconer, who the evidence -- no, sir, I don't think
that's the right reference.  It's -- sir, I've given you
the wrong reference there.  It's SCGV0000170_152.
Sir, in order not to waste any more time I will
simply do as I originally proposed, which is simply to
read out --

--Result #891--
   The date of this is 23 September 1999.  What it
says is:
"The First Minister has seen your minute of
17 September to the Minister for Health outlining a way
forward following the meeting with the Haemophilia
Society.  He was a little concerned about the possible
financial implications and fears that an open mind could
be taken to mean an open cheque book.  He would be
grateful for information on the likely exposure if
compensation were to be awarded."
The reason I was going to put this up, sir, is it is
a slightly unusual document, in that it contains what
looks like a sticky label where what is written there
says:
"Some old papers from FM's office.  Interesting to
see the wheels of decision-making in private office."
But there is also another handwritten annotation on
the document which says:
"Ms Deacon's office advises that this is very much
a PR exercise and there is unlikely to be any
compensation paid."
Sir, for once I'm not sure I really have anything 
   148I can add to the text that I have read out, which
I think is fairly self explanatory.
Sir, even in the period after the investigation we
have set out in our submission that the overriding
control of the Westminster Civil Service and the fixed
attitude based on the HIV Litigation principles
continued into the period after the internal
investigation, a period in which Malcolm Chisholm was
the Health Minister.  In our submission he was
politically pressured into offering some level of
compensation but departed radically from the
recommendations of the Ross Committee, which he had set
up.
Even his modest offering was reacted to furiously,
it would appear, by the then UK Health Minister,
Alan Milburn.  By the time Lord Reid took over, the
political die was cast, but he ensured that Westminster
took control of the Skipton Fund.  He said in his
evidence on 21 July 2022 at page 15 that:
"You can see from the papers that there is
a suspicion on the part of some officials, particularly
in the Treasury, that we don't want the Scottish tail
wagging, you know, the English dog, as it were."
The key was to ensure that Scotland would not bow to
political pressure from the petitions, which were still                
    149live, and the health committee to go further and
implement the Ross recommendations for compensation.
One might describe that eventuality as being the
operation of the local democratic process, ie what
devolution had been all about.
The culmination of this process was a loss of local
control for the Scots and years of reversion to the
pre-Skipton position: still not listening to the
patients, still no assessment of the needs or losses of
the community, still no examination of anything like the
full range of the issues arising in Scotland.
In addition, sir, the Inquiry has evidence that each
CV litigations based on the similar parameters to
the A v National Blood Authority decision were settled
for paltry sums which it appears could not possibly have
represented the full loss.
None of them, as far as we understand, were settled
on a provisional basis, which is my reading of it,
specifically provided for in one of the short procedural
elements of the A decision.  It was of course known at
that time that the disease could become much more
serious in the future and therefore, in dealing with the
possibility that that might happen, and in accordance
with the instruction of the then Health Minister to
settle the matters fairly, it would, in my submission, 
   150have been appropriate for that to have been the basis
upon which the cases could have settled, which would
have been a competent way of proceeding in Scotland.
Sir, I move on now to my ninth section, which is the
solutions.
As with others, sir, who have spoken on the infected
and affected side, we have a lengthy list of proposed
non-financial recommendations.  I do not intend to go
through these today, although I do note that these, as
I have said already, have been considered by the
Scottish state bodies, and in relation to those they
have issued a number of favourable responses, which we
find encouraging.
We would say however, sir, that it is important that
the general acceptance of the principles which we have
proposed in a number of areas should not be taken to
encourage you, sir, not to make the recommendations, if
you agree with us, that certain steps need to be taken.
We may have outlined, and I think others have too,
that we accept that it would not be possible for you,
sir, to devise, for example, a new system of palliative
care for liver disease in Scotland if you agree with us
that that is something which the evidence shows should
be looked at.  The way in which we would suggest you
proceed on that and other matters is as follows: 
   151a general recommendation to that effect could be made,
and I note the Scottish Government in particular seems
to accept that that would be something with which they
would certainly wish to become engaged.
We have recommended that a task force be set up in
order to monitor compliance with that general aspiration
and to have more discussions about practical matters
that will of course have to be attended to about how
that matter is dealt with in Scotland.
You will note, sir, which I think was mentioned by
my learned friend Mr Johnston, that we have, with regard
to the specific recommendation about palliative care,
suggested that, rather than that matter be dealt with
fully by the task force which will monitor its progress
in due course, that a specific short-life working group
should be set up.  This is following the model which
happened after the Penrose Inquiry, when a similar group
was set up to have some initial thinking about how its
one recommendation would be implemented.
In our submission this would be relevant in relation
to the area of palliative care.  Because although the
commitment made by the Scottish Government is a general
one in that area, there are, as we set out in our
submissions, a number of important specific matters
which arise in relation to end stage liver disease which 
   152merit separate consideration.  That's the reason why
that has been put forward.
We, sir, have also set out in our submission that it
is important that there be a fulsome apology.  The
reasons for that I think are apparent, again, in the
evidence which you can see, sir, in the psychosocial
group report and, indeed, the evidence they gave to the
Inquiry, where they talk about the importance of
a proper and fulsome apology being made.
I recognise, sir, towards the beginning of my oral
statement, that in this regard, although limited to
being made on a corporate basis, those apologies made by
the Scottish NHS are a model of the type of thing that
the psychosocial group suggested would have a real
impact in allowing people to come to terms with the
harms which they have suffered.  That is not the case,
I should say, on the part of others.  That has been
addressed, of course, with regard to the Department of
Health by other speakers.
Equally, sir, I should draw to your attention that
although the Scottish Government made a general apology,
and reiterated the apology made by the First Minister at
the end of the Penrose Inquiry, that the apology which
in general terms we have sought from them relates
predominantly to the matters I have just been discussing                
    153in the period after devolution.
None of those matters were part of the terms of
reference of the Penrose Inquiry, although they are, of
course, part of the terms of reference of this Inquiry.
Therefore, on that one matter, I think it cannot be
taken to be the case that the Scottish government could,
at that time, have been apologising, in the context of
the Penrose Inquiry, for matters that it did not look
at.  The general nature of the apology gives no
indication that that was the case.  As a result, sir,
I draw your attention to the broad but specific ways in
which we would suggest that you invite what I would
describe as proper apologies to be made on behalf of
government.
I have, sir, in our submission spent quite a lot of
time dealing with what one might call the financial
solution.  I would like to make clear, sir, one point
which I think is important.  You asked us to address in
our written submissions matters of importance to our
clients.  Although, of course, the possibility of
a Robert Francis style compensation arrangement is of
importance to all the infected and affected, I would
like to make clear that it was not at the instigation of
my clients that we dedicated so much time to it.
I think in reality, sir, you will see from their 
   154evidence that none of my clients suggested that why they
engaged with this Inquiry was out of any financial
motive.  The reason why we have devoted so much time to
it is that, as it happens, the area of reparation is one
in which I and my learned junior practice, and therefore
we thought that we could, in particular in light of the
fact that there were a number of Scots law
considerations, be of some assistance to you, and
I certainly hope that's the case.
We have, sir, approached this on the basis that, in
order to understand why Sir Robert Francis has come to
the conclusions which he has reached, it is important to
undertake an analysis of the principles which underpin
his solution.
We broadly agree with his solution.  However, there
are a number of areas in which, as a result of the
limitations of his investigation, which he set out and
readily accepted, he has not gone far enough, we say,
and that there are elements of the financial
compensation scheme which should be incorporated based
on the much fuller evidence to which you, sir, have had
access.
There are a number of points which I would like to
make in a very general sense about this.  The first is,
sir, in particular based on the failure of the 
   155government to be able to provide a response to
Mr Snowden's question about their intentions with regard
to compensation.  We, like Ms Gollop's clients, have
become concerned about the government's ability to
deliver compensation, as she put it.
The one difference between her clients and mine on
the face of what she said is that the scepticism, which
she described as having arisen in the last couple of
weeks, has been a scepticism which, in my submission,
quite reasonably has existed within my clients for
a matter of decades.
This is because, sir, despite the fact that a number
of clinicians suggested that compensation be awarded in
Scotland in the late 1990s, and an independent
committee, the Ross Committee, which reported 20 years
ago, recommended compensation for HCV cases which had
reached stage 2 liver disease and damages equivalent to
those which would be available to be paid in Scotland in
fatal cases where negligence had caused the death, no
compensation has been awarded in Scotland.
The medical consequences of infection have, of
course, moved on since then.  The stage 1, stage 2
classification from Skipton has become slightly
outdated.
However, in my submission, sir, this has 
   156an important practical consequence.  Our position is
that, as a result of that scepticism, we invite you,
sir, to try to express a view specifically on as many
elements of the compensation scheme as you feel
appropriate.  We have sought, in our submission, to try
to provide you with our assistance on the way in which
matters which, under Robert Francis' scheme, would be
left to his medical and legal panels, could, in our
view, be adjudicated upon by you.
That would have a number of advantages.  It would
mean that the person who has been sitting for a number
of years hearing all the evidence would be the person
making the decisions, for example, about the appropriate
levels of compensation, at least in certain cases.
It would speed up the process which, of course, was
a concern of Robert Francis and one which you yourself
expressed, sir, in the interim report, awarding interim
compensation.
It also, sir, would, to an extent, allay my clients'
scepticism that if this matter is left in the hands of
Government, compensation, despite the recommendations
which have been made, like at the time of the Ross
committee, will simply not happen.
As a result of our Scots law assessment sir, we
think that there are a number of areas where it would be                
    157possible for you to come to specific figures which
should be awarded for certain categories.  If you are
not able to do that or don't feel that that would be
appropriate, sir, some indication of the parameters,
either in terms of the way in which damages might be
calculated or, indeed, how much might be awarded would,
in our view, be helpful.
As you will see, sir, we have presented an analysis
which is based on the principles of Scots law and the
principle of parity, which was favoured by Sir Robert.
Though the harms arose across the UK in different
ways, we think that the harms are comparable and that
there should be parity across the UK.  Sir Robert agreed
and in his evidence we understood him to be saying that
one of the purposes of a compensation tribunal was to
try to keep matters based on past history away from the
courts.
The need for swift justice and finality and the need
to have a system whereby patients could buy into the way
things were going dealt with, all meant that it would be
appropriate to keep matters away from the courts and
litigation, which would inevitably be lengthy, costly
and in many respects not suitable, as the evidence of
previous litigations has shown.
If it is correct, sir, that Sir Robert suggested 
   158that we wish to keep matters out of the courts, and that
therefore, in his assessment, which we agree with,
awards should be commensurate with court awards for
compensation, with certain bespoke elements relevant to
this community that perhaps are not appropriate for the
common law at large, it would, in our submission, be
logical, sir, that those should be fixed in accordance
with Scots law principles.
The reason for that is set out in the helpful
opinion which you have received from Mr Milligan KC,
which is under the reference INQY0000416.
What that points out is a number of important
features, the result of which is that Scots law, in
particular in the area of fatal claims, although also in
other areas such as interest on past losses -- Scots law
would take a different approach from the way that
Sir Robert Francis set out his report based on English
principles.
Our position, as I stated, sir, is that the tariffs
should be fixed for the reasons I set out and that the
tariffs should be fixed in accordance with Scots law
numbers.  The tariffs in particular, in fatal cases,
would be greatly assisted in my submission by the fact
that, although we don't have a tariff-based system for
the award of damages under the Damages (Scotland) Act 
   1592011 in fatal cases, it would be fair to say, as
Mr Milligan reflects in his helpful report, that there
are quite narrow parameters in which awards tend to be
made to different classes of claimant.
I was asked to look at the Milligan report and
report if there were any matters on which I took issue.
Mr Milligan's undoubted expertise in this area means
that there are only a few matters which I have to
mention, which I hope are of assistance.
At paragraph 49 of his report he attributes, in
fact, higher figures for what he calls "loss of
society".  That is actually a slightly outdated figure
than I have submitted in my analysis.  Of course, I take
no issue with his figures.  I would draw attention, sir,
to the very recent case of Paterson and others v
Lanarkshire Health Board, which is reported under the
neutral citation 2003CSOH1, a decision of 6 January of
this year of Lord Arthurson, which does seem to support
a recent upward trend in awards.
In that fatal case, £70,000 was awarded to the
children of the deceased, now adults, which I think is
the highest such award to such a category, and £100,000
award was awarded to the deceased's mother, which again
is a higher figure than the one which I allocated in my
submission but is commensurate with the one suggested by 
   160Mr Milligan.
Furthermore, sir, his commentary on the law related
to mitigation of loss appear apposite here.  The law
requiring that that not be judged too finely on the
basis that such criticism does not come well for those
whom themselves have created the emergency.
He also, sir, at page 9 draws attention to the fact
that the use of half rate interest would, as I have
submitted, in a court require to take account of the
fact that different judicial rates of interest would
apply in the period over which loss has been suffered by
the community here.
Therefore, my suggestion that the half rate of
interest, which would be applied currently, of 4 per
cent is already a compromise, based on the fact that
that rates that would have been used in previous years
where interest rates were higher might result in
a higher figure being used.
Other than that sir, I suggest that the report is
extremely helpful in setting out some of these
principles and I think accords with the assessment we
have made of what you should do.
In this regard, sir, there is one other matter which
I would like to mention, that is the submission which
has been made on behalf of the Scottish Government                
    161relating to whether or not past payments under the
various trusts and schemes should be taken into account
in the assessment of compensation.
Broadly speaking sir, we disagree that that would be
appropriate and we share the view of Sir Robert that the
way in which those payments should be characterised is
payments which have been made to alleviate poverty and
are of a benevolent nature.
This is consistent with the evidence which you have
heard, indeed the evidence that was given by the then
Minister, Ms Gougeon, on 18 May 2021 at page 36,
confirms it was her position that previous payments had
not been intended to be compensatory.
Furthermore, in my submission, the characterisation
that Sir Robert places on the previous payments is
consistent with other evidence heard by others involved
in the administration of schemes, in particular
Mr Lister who gave evidence on the Caxton Foundation
Payments.  He said the purpose of those was to lift
people out of poverty which, in many cases, was created
by state culpability leading to infection.
In my submission again, that is consistent with the
analysis.
Therefore, sir, we do not agree with Mr Johnston's
approach and, indeed, we found it slightly surprising, 
   162or those whom I represent did, that the Scottish
Government would seek to take such a position, in
particular in circumstances where they agree, as I think
everyone does, although perhaps for slightly different
reasons, that the money should be paid from the UK
Government's funds, on the basis that the original
infections were all caused before devolution, or at
least that's the argument that myself, Ms Gollop and
indeed Mr Johnston propose.
There are a number of other arguments, sir, which we
don't think are ones you should accept.
An argument was made about fairness, based on the
fact that people have received variable amounts in the
past.  I understood Mr Johnston to accept that it would
only be payments which could be classed as compensatory
which fall to be deducted but he offered no means of
understanding what types of payments would fall to be
characterised that way.  Furthermore, sir, our
submission is that the concern that he had, that there
were people, I think, who may not have received
compensation under the scheme who should have done might
be disadvantaged is not well founded.
I think it must be the Scottish Government's
position that those who were due to receive support have
received it, in particular because he explained that 
   163extensive efforts had been made to trace untraced
transfusion infections with HCV after the Penrose
recommendation.
Therefore, it is, I think, the position that, if
anyone has received less than they should have done in
the past, such that such unfairness in his submission
may arise, that, in our submission, would logically be
dealt with a back payment of support rather than
everyone falling foul of this rule which is being
proposed.
Sir, I don't intend to go into, to any extent, any
of the other recommendations.  They are numerous but
I would urge you, sir, to make recommendations on this
basis.
One thing which I should mention, sir, is we do
associate ourselves with the general position of the
Scottish Government in this regard.  They have indicated
a willingness and indeed a desire to continue to control
at least the Scottish Infected Blood Support Scheme.
There may be some suggestion made by others that the
administration of those schemes should change.  We
support them in that, on the basis that local
accountability and local administration is something
which is certainly of considerable importance and value
to my clients. 
   164Could I just, as far as non-financial
recommendations, sir, point out that I have provided the
Inquiry a few days ago with an article which appeared in
the Daily Record, which I think neatly set out the
Scottish position on what might broadly be described as
the "Hillsborough Law".
There is a current controversy in Scotland about
this, which has arisen between the Labour opposition and
the Government.  I simply wish to refer that to you,
sir, because it may well be, as others have done, that
you wish to make recommendations which fall in that
general area and I thought it would be useful for you to
be aware of the fact that there is a certain
controversy.
The basic position is the Government has rather set
its face against a number of the recommendations which
are made and which are being so passionately supported
by Mr Burnham.  They do so, in part, on a technical
distinction between there being some difference between
fatal accident inquiries in Scotland and coroners'
inquests in England.  My position would be that
substantively there is no different between the two and
the difficulties which the Scottish Government seem to
have with it are not well founded.
Sir, in concluding, I wish to make brief though                
    165important reference to the dedicated work of you and
your team.  May I also pay particular tribute to the
counsel team.  In my humble submission, they are
deserving of the highest praise, not only for their
professionalism and dedication, but also for the
compassion, courtesy and humanity in which they have
handled both their professional duties and their
personal interactions with the infected and affected:
compassion, courtesy and humanity, which they have
always deserved but far too seldom encountered with
their previous dealings with authority.
If I may, sir, be so bold as to say that in these
personal interactions, the approach has mirrored
entirely the approach which you and your staff have
taken, in all of your dealings with those whom
I represent.  In that regard and in many others, they
wish to pass on their profound gratitude.
Sir, may I also pay tribute to the dignity, courage
and responsibility which my clients have shown in their
dealings with this Inquiry.  From amongst my client
group, may I pay particular tribute to the fearlessness
and responsibility of Bill Wright, the intelligence and
doggedness of Alice Mackie, the scepticism and ferocity
of Bruce Norville, and the courage of the late Philip
Dolan.  They fought on in the face of Government 
   166intransigence to the plight of the infected and affected
community, as appears to be recognised in so many of the
submissions received by the Inquiry.
In doing so, they suffered incalculable further harm
to themselves and their families.  It has been
a particular privilege to have acted on behalf of those
courageous individuals who have spoken for so many
others so selflessly for so many years, and others in
the community who they represent.
It has been an honour, sir, to speak for those who,
through the culpability of the state, are not able to
speak for themselves.
Sir, here where the words end, those whom
I represent put their fate in your hands.  They do so
willingly.  They do so with faith that you will complete
your task with compassion and humanity.  They do so with
for the first time for many some hope for the future.
They do so with clarity about what was needlessly done
to them by the state.
I leave you, sir, with a short video presentation.
My clients, the infected and affected of Scotland.
(Video is played)  

--Result #892--

  
Good morning, sir.  Good morning, everybody.
These are the submissions on behalf of The
Haemophilia Society.  They are also submissions of
a number of people with Core Participant status,
represented by my solicitors, Eversheds Sutherland
.
They include Eli
s
abeth and Jonathan Buggins, and
some of you may remember listening to Eli
s
abeth
, 
who was
on a panel of parents with infected children; Sharon
Lewis, who is the widow of John
 
Prothero, a member of
the Executive Committee in the 1980s; Andrew
 
Martin,
Paul
 
Sartain, and David Watters, whose evidence many of
you will also remember, he was the general secretary of
the Society also in the 1980s.
I also represent 14 other individuals who would
prefer not to be named.  I am going to say a brief
something about those, some
 
who do wish to be named,
just so you understand where they're coming from.
Elisabeth Buggins, the mother of four children, one
of them Jonathan, three sons and a daughter.  Her three
 
2
sons were all diagnosed with severe haemophilia A in the
late 1970s and early 1980s and their care took place at
Birmingham Children's Hospital under
,
 then
,
 Dr Frank
Hill.
Eli
s
abeth discovered that two of her three sons,
Richard and Jonathan, were infected with HIV when she
saw
 a list of names on the hospital fridge.  As she says
in her statement
: 
"
Dr Hill was concerned that our knowing of
a positive diagnosis would change our relationship with
our child.  There was 
no
 treatment and nothing could be
done about the results.
  
That was the attitude."
Her son Richard died in 1986 at the age of eight and
she gave evidence in October last year on the panel that
I
 
just mentioned.
  
Her son Jonathan has made a statement to the
Inquiry
, 
not yet disclosed.  His elder brother was
Richard, the one who died in 1986
, 
and Jonathan's
statement addresses the impact of his treatment at the
Birmingham Children's Hospital and of being infected.
When he was 12, his parents brought a medical negligence
compensation claim on his behalf which was settled at
trial shortly before Dr Hill was due to give evidence
,
when Dr Hill's employer offered £75,000, which sum was
accepted.  And in his statement, Jon gives important
 
3
views on litigation
: 
how he feels it does not improve
patient safety
 
and it enables organisations and
individuals to hide, escape their responsibility, and
obstruct the search for the truth.
Sharon Lewis, John Prothero's widow, has made
a statement which 
has
 also not yet been disclosed
.  
When
it is, I very much recommend reading it.  It's
WITN3107001.
John Prothero, her husband, died from the
consequences of 
an 
HIV
-
related infection on 19 October
1989, 
when he 
was
 45 years old.  He 
was
 the Society's
treasurer and a board member, and she says in her
statement that
, 
during the course of John's life
, 
he
campaigned for the interests of people with haemophilia
to be advanced in terms of achieving access to justice,
acknowledgement of their situation, and also recompense
in relation to the consequences that had befallen the
haemophilia community.
Andrew Martin has made a statement which is
disclosed and not quite yet on the website.  He has
haemophilia 
--Result #893--
  He was diagnosed with hepatitis C at
some point in or around 1993.  And he says:
"When I 
was
 diagnosed with hepatitis C, my mother
was very quick to say that it was her belief that 
no
doctor would ever do anything that would be detrimental
 
4
to my health, and it has been a shock to discover that
we were not being protected or at least provided with
the 
information
 that the Government or clinicians knew."
Paul Sartain has made a statement which is available
on the website.  He was diagnosed with severe
haemophilia A in 1970 and affected with hepatitis B
and
 
C
.  And he says:
"In my view, my parents and/or I did not think to
ask about risks because my treatment, cryoprecipitate or
Factor VIII, was to ease the pain and suffering from
a bleed.  Many times as a young child I would have
countless nights of disturb
ed
 sleep, pray for the pain
to go away, and/or violently shake my head until I was
so dizzy and feeling nauseous that I'd slump back on to
my bed in a state of stupor."
And last
ly, something 
about David Watters.  He was
the coordinator and general secretary between 1981 and
1994.  He has made a statement
, 
which is available, and
he gave evidence on 
10
, 11 and 12 February 
20
21.  David
says his heart aches for victims of infected blood and
he said
:
"[
He
] 
won't ever forget the good friends on the
Executive Committee and throughout the Society who
I lost through HIV and AIDS and who I remember with
affection."

The Society asks the Inquiry to find that it and its
members were fortunate to have the services of
Mr Watters.  Prior to joining the Society he was
a social worker and he worked particularly with homeless
people.  And after leaving the Society, which he did not
want to do, he worked for another healthcare
-
related
charity.  His motivation throughout his professional
life was to improve the lives of others less fortunate
than himself, and he worked tirelessly in pursuit of
that goal.  He advocated for people with haemophilia at
benefit tribunals.  He campaigned for financial relief
for those infected with HIV.  He was there at the start
of the campaigns for hepatitis C compensation.  And he
was a gifted administrator.  He and the Reverend Tanner
were patently good men doing the best they could for the
entire bleeding disorder community in close to
impossible circumstances.  And you will all know that
the Reverend Tanner's son Mark died of infected blood
related illnesses
 
and was ill throughout much of the
time that the Reverend Tanner was chair of the Society.
Those are the pen portraits.  I now want to quote
from two reports.  The first quotation is the same one
that Mr Snowden gave you on Tuesday from the
Bishop
 
Jones
'
 November 2017 report on Hillsborough.
That was the crush at a football stadium in April 1989
 
6
which caused almost 100
 
deaths.  Mr Snowden quoted that
part of the report where the Bishop explained how he
came by the phrase "the patronising disposition of
unaccountable power" and talked about the experience of
the Hillsborough families when
, 
in all innocence and
with a good conscience, they asked questions of those in
authority on behalf of those they loved, and found the
institutions closing ranks
.
He went on to say this:
"And so the Hillsborough 
families' struggle to gain
justice for the 96 has a vicarious quality to it so that
whatever they can achieve in calling to account those in
authority is 
of value to the whole nation.
"
"
The concerns that it deals with are both historic
and contemporary."
That applies just as much to all of you.  Everything
that you've done has had the same vicarious quality to
it, and everything that you have done will be of benefit
to the nation.  The concerns of this Inquiry go further
back even than the events of Hillsborough, and as
yesterday's submissions on behalf of the DHS
C
, to which
I'll return in a moment, amply demonstrate, they are not
only contemporary, but pressing.
The second quotation is from Baroness Cumberlege's
report 
First Do 
No
 Harm
, and that 
was
 published midway
 
7
through this Inquiry in July 2020.  Some of the matters
into which her review inquired dated back to 1950, very
similar to this Inquiry.  The passage of time and the
fact that attitudes, cultures, communication
, 
and so on
,
have changed over the decades did not prevent the
Baroness from getting to the heart of the matter and
they won't stand in your way, sir, either.
Much of the evidence of this Inquiry corroborates
her conclusion, and this is what she said:
"We have found that the healthcare system in which
I include the NHS, private providers, the regulators,
and professional bodies, pharmaceutical and device
manufacturers and pol
icy 
makers, is disjointed, siloed,
unresponsive
 
and defensive.  It doesn't adequately
recognise that patients are its
 raison d'etre
.  It's
failed to listen to their concerns and when belatedly
it's decided to act 
it has
 
too
 often moved glacially.
Indeed, over these 
two
 years we have found ourselves in
the position of recommending, encouraging and urging the
system to take action that should have been taken long
ago.  The system is not good enough at spotting trends
in practice and outcomes that give rise to safety
concerns.  Listening to patients is pivotal to that.
"
It all sounds horribly familiar.  
First Do No Harm
is a document which I will come back to
, 
if I have time
,
 
8
so I'd like to put it on screen so that those of you who
are understandably not familiar with it can see the
similarities here
.
Thank you, Lawrence.  You're ahead of me, which is
great.  Page
 -- 
we've got paragraphs 1
.1 to 1.3
 and
those are on internal page 0009.  That looks like 18.
That's it.
It's really close type.  I don't know if we can
enlarge 1.2.  Very briefly, so that it makes sense, this
is what she was looking at
: 
hormone pregnancy tests
,
which were taken off the market in the late 1970s,
thought to be associated with birth defects and
miscarriages
; 
sodium valproate
, 
which is
an
 
anti-epileptic
, 
which causes physical malformations,
autism and development delay in children when taken by
their mothers in pregnancy
; 
and pelvic mesh implants
used in the surgical repair of organ prolapse and to
manage urinary incontinence
, 
linked to crippling,
life
-
changing complications.
If we look at page 0011, she identified right at the
bottom 16 common and compelling themes which chime very
much with your experiences.  Number 
1: 
"
the
 
lack of 
information
 to make informed
choices

10
All of that will be horribly familiar to all of you.
Thank you, Lawrence.  You can take that down.
To that list, I would add two things.  The first and
lesser is the indignity, harshness and hostile nature of
the so-called support schemes.  The other more important
matter is death and bereavement.  There are 
no
 words
that can truly capture the depth and intensity of
suffering that you have recounted to us.  Some witnesses
may have found making statements or giving oral evidence
cathartic
 
but
, 
for others, it's been traumatic.  They've
been through so much, and everybody at the Society is
humbled and deeply grateful to them for suffering
further 
through
 telling us about it.
Doctors really struggle to talk to patients about
risk in a way that gives patients the 
information
 that
they need and enables everyone to make the choice that
is right for them as an
 
individual.
Informed choice is the heart of what went wrong over
and over again.  Safe treatment was taken away by the
Government so that it was not an
 
available choice
, or
doctors consciously or unconsciously took that choice
away because they acted without thinking or thought they
knew best.  There can be 
no
 more compelling teaching
tool than the firsthand accounts of what infected blood
has done to you
 
and that you have provided to us
 
11
selflessly by giving us the evidence that you have done,
and allowing it to be captured on camera.  Thank you.
Thank you to
o 
to the Inquiry.  
The
 kindness, calm,
and consistency of the front-of-house staff, their
regular meetings around the country, the absolute
professionalism of the legal team, we know this more
than you do because we lawyers watch other lawyers, but
it really has been the best of the best
 -- 
and 
the
technical teams
.
Sir Brian, your attention to detail and your very
personal involvement have been notable features every
single day of this long
-
running Inquiry.  If the culture
that your vision for your Inquiry has created could be
exported into the NHS and Government more widely, that
would be grounds for hope for a state that is more
listening, compassionate
 
and responsive to the needs of
those it here to serve.
Which brings me to yesterday.  We're all familiar
with the phrase "actions speak louder than words".
Yesterday we got 
no
 actions
 
and 
no
 words.  But
, 
more
precisely, we got a lot of words that said nothing at
all.  The first thing to say is that none of that is the
fault of 
Ms
 Grey, King's Counsel
, 
or her team.  I have
no
 reason to doubt, and I think you should not either,
that she and her team have worked 
hard
 and to a very
 
12
high
 standard to further the work of the Inquiry
 
and
provide statements and submissions that
, 
so far
 as 
can
be seen from the outside
, 
are clear, thorough
 
and
meticulously searched and referenced.
Ms
 Grey said as little as she did because her
client, the Department of Health and Social Care,
provided her with nothing more that she could say.  The
fault and the responsibility lies not just with the
Department she represented but the whole of the Cabinet
,
from the Prime Minister down.
When we were informed at the end of the day on
Tuesday that the Department's submissions would not
start at 
10.00
 as timetabled but instead at 
2.00, 
and be
over by 
3.00
, there were a lot of questions about what
that might mean.  There was, within the Society,
a degree of expectation
 
that the submissions were going
to be short because the Government had something of
substance to announce.  Instead, time that could have
been put to good use by infected and affected Core
Participants was wasted.
In September 2018 
Ms
 Grey informed the Inquiry that
the Department accepted that things happened that should
not have happened and that it was sorry.  Yesterday
, 
she
delivered the astonishing news that after a four-year
opportunity to reflect on those things that should not

have happened, the Department had somehow gone backwards
and is now unable to identify what it was sorry for when
the Inquiry started.  There's been some sort of
groupthink amnesia.
Ms
 Grey referred to the fact that on 15 December,
the Cabinet Secretary told the House of Commons that the
Government accepted moral responsibility for infected
blood
 
but
, 
yesterday, it was unable to say through its
lawyers why it has accepted moral responsibility or what
that 
actually
 means.
My clients accept that they cannot force the
Department to say what it is sorry for.  Sir Brian had
a go
, 
and if he can't make that happen
 
then neither can
we.  But the cowardly approach taken by the Department
has three consequences: first, what little trust there
might have been has gone
.  
Second, and this was not the Society's position
before yesterday afternoon, it now joins with the
submissions of Mr Snowden, King's Counsel, on behalf of
those represented by Collins, that there need to be
further interim recommendations on compensation for
parents, children and grandchildren who have been
bereaved by 
infected blood
.  The payments of £100,000
were only paid because
, 
Sir Brian
, 
you made an
 
interim
recommendation in that regard.  Bereaved people have had
 
14
nothing and they deserve something now.  There is 
no
reason to believe that the Government will do anything
without a recommendation from you.
Third, it is absolutely imperative now that this
Inquiry does not end with the 
publication
 of the report.
For as long as your Inquiry is alive, Sir Brian, people
have trust and hope that there will be accountability,
compensation
 
and lasting change.  The fear is that
, 
as
soon as you close this Inquiry
, 
there may be delay,
backsliding
 
and nothing will really change.  We would
not want
 see your report to be as widely disregarded as
it would appear Bishop
 
Jone
s
' report into Hillsborough
has been.
Yesterday
 
rather proved that that fear may 
well
 be
well founded.  A way must be found to hold the
Government's 
feet
 to the fire after the report is
published.
Ms
 Grey mentioned Mr Quin's statement in the House
of
 
Commons on 15 December.  We would mention the debate
in the House of Lords on 20
 
December last year, five
days later.  I've given the reference to 
Ms
 Richards,
and we'll make that reference available to you,
Sir Brian.
There is a transcript of the debate on the
TheyWorkForYou.com website
, 
which you may be interested
 
15
to read.  Baroness Neville-Rolfe, who is the Minister
for the Government in the House of Lords, said that
Ms
 Sue Gray
, 
at the Cabinet Office
, 
is bringing together
permanent secretaries from the Treasury, HMRC, the
Cabinet Office, DHSC, the DWP, the DLUH
C
, (I think
that's the levelling up one), the Devolved Nations and
others.  She told the House of Lords that this group met
monthly and that -- this is a quote:
"It is gearing up
, 
thinking about the IT systems and
how we ensure that we contact people who might want to
seek compensation
, 
once
 we know the precise framework
and make sure that everyone can respond.  Publicity is
very important with these public issues and noble Lords
across the house can help with that so that people know
what is happening."
She then said that careful consideration was being
given as to whether there should be an arm's length
body.  She said the Government would want to work with
"people affected
" 
and acknowledged the work of the APPG.
She said she'd make progress statements to the
house.  On 11
 
January this year
, 
in a written answer to
a Parliamentary 
question
, 
Mr Quin said that the
cross-Government working party was taking forward work
on the establishment of an
 
arm's length body
.
The Society makes three points.  The first is about
 
16
the need for the working 
group
 to listen to infected and
affected people's views on the compensation framework
they want and need now, not when the finished product is
delivered.
Returning briefly to the Government's implementation
of the Cumberlege Review's recommendations, the Society
notes
 -- 
and it's one of my New Year
'
s resolutions to
stop bombarding 
Ms
 Richards with emails telling her to
listen to Woman's Hour -- that she gave an
 
interview to
the BBC -- there was an
 
interview on Woman's Hour on
3 January 2023
, 
given by the Patient Safety
Commissioner.  That was a recommendation of Baroness
Cumberledge
's
 report and Dr Henrietta Hughes has been in
post for some months now.
Dr Hughes talked about the mesh removal centres
which have been set up in response to the Cumberlege
Review's findings and Dr Hughes told the BBC that these
centres are not meeting the needs of users because when
the clinics and systems were designed, the views of the
women harmed by mesh were not listened to.  The Society
is concerned that the same error may be being repeated
right now in relation to the working 
group
 setting up
the infected blood compensation framework
.
Second, transparency.  The Society would suggest
 --
and
, 
Sir Brian, we might like to tempt you into

considering an
 
interim recommendation
 -- 
that it is
reasonable to ask that we have published (i) 
the
 names
and members of the working 
group; (
ii) the dates of
their meetings and the agenda and minutes
; 
and (iii)
that there are regular publicly available written
progress reports
.  
Infected and affected people
shouldn't have to scour the Internet looking for reports
of debates in the House of Lords to find out what is
going on.  If the working 
group
 wanted to report, they
could do so to this Inquiry and keep this Inquiry in the
loop, not just make statements in the House of Lords.
Third, just going back to that quote about what the
working 
group
 is currently doing, thinking about the IT
systems and how we ensure that we contact people, it's
hard to know where to start.
Shout out to Baroness Neville-Rolfe and her
colleagues
: 
come on down to Aldwych House.  People here
are very nice.  They don't b
i
te
 
and you can talk to them
and you can listen to them and you can find out what
they need, and there are a whole load of people sitting
behind me who could probably give you the list of people
to contact right here and right now.  You really don't
need to ask members of the House of Lords to do your
publicity work for you
.  
It's all here, handed on
a plate, if you would only like to come and listen.
 
18
There's still time.
You've had a long time to think about what you want
and what you need from a compensation framework.  You
should be in the 
tent
, not outside it.
I'm going to turn now to the past.  These
submissions look at the pas
t
, the present and the
future.  They're focused on the future because that's
where the Society can make a positive difference for
people 
who are 
suffering 
now
 and for future generations
of people with a bleeding disorder.  In not touching on
the past at greater length, the Society isn't seeking to
evade scrutiny, and we have tried to explain its
knowledge of risk and its actions
, 
particularly in the
1980s
, 
as thoroughly as possible in written submissions.
We've asked the questions
: 
why 
did 
the Society
support the importation into the UK of US blood product
that it knew carried a higher hepatitis risk than UK
treatment
, 
before the UK 
had
 achieve
d
 self-sufficiency?
From '83 to '85
, why 
did it tell its members that
the risk of being treated with US products and getting
AIDS was outweighed by the risk of not being treated at
all and why did it press the Government to continue
importing US products that it knew could be contaminated
with AIDS even when it was known that AIDS was a killer
disease for which there was 
no
 cure?
 
19
Before I look at those
, 
a
 
word about money
 
and the
cost of haemophilia.  I'm going to quote from a document
that's on the website which is a collection of pieces
from the British Medical Journal
, 
and I give a trigger
warning that it contains language and an
 
ethical stance
which may be offensive.  It goes without saying that the
Society wants to make it very clear that it's not its
position that anyone in Government or the NHS intended
the death of any patient or section of the public but
that 
this is an
 
important part of the context of the
lives of people with haemophilia at the beginning of the
1970s.
The Society was always mindful that if NHS money was
going to be spent on haemophilia treatment, the
Government would want to see that justified financially,
but there was 
actually
 more at stake.  In 1971
, 
the BMJ
published
 a profile opinion piece that had coverage in
the national press, arguing that the successful
treatment of haemophilia, especially for severe cases,
was enabling not only the survival of these 
high
-
demand
patients but also their likelihood of having children.
This is the quote:
"If we continue the policy of treating such
sufferers with the full resources of modern medicine, we
shall spend a steadily increasing proportion of the
 
20
national income for their benefit and reduce the
proportion available for the care of other forms of
illness, education, technical development
, 
and so on.
Are we prepar
ed 
to pay such a price and increase the
number of biochemical cripples fourfold in a generation
?
Is not this too high a price to pay for our comfortable
glow of companionable humanity?
"
Later correspondence in the BMJ was consistently
critical of that stance and there was never any further
discussion of eugenics with regard to haemophilia.
But the cost of keeping people with haemophilia
alive has never gone away.  One thinks, 
for
 
example
, of
the Society's campaign for Recombinant for All in the
late 1990s and the fight to get that extended from
children to adults
 
and the restricted access on cost
ground to Harvoni, 
for
 
example
, that was still taking
place as late as 2016, the year before this Inquiry was
announced.
When preparing for the Archer Inquiry, one of the
documents that the Department of Health was concerned
might cause some embarrassment was a March 19
8
5
document
, 
and that was a memo that said
: 
"
Steps to prevent the remainder of the 
haemophiliac
population 
becoming 
seropositive are likely to have
a strong cost benefit plus in terms of lives saved.

  21
course
, 
the maintenance of the life of a haemophiliac is
itself expensive and I'm very much afraid that those who
are already doomed will generate savings which more than
cover the cost of testing blood donations."
A few points may be made.  First, and most
obviously, the fact that lives of people with
haemophilia is expensive is not the fault of
haemophiliacs.  People with rare diseases exist in every
population and in countries with a developed healthcare
system, part of the duty of government is to protect
them as much as everybody else.  Second, freeze dried
large pool concentrates 
were
 welcomed partly because
they were seen as an
 
improved means of enabling the
bleeding disorder community to make a financial
contribution
.
In 1979, the Department of Health and Social
Services sponsored a study into home treatment and found
that it "provided savings in time lost from school and
work, a greater sense of security, and increased
capacity for planning ahead"
.
In 1989 the Reverend Tanner wrote to Norman Lamont
seeking more financial support for people with
haemophilia infected with AIDS and explained that "they
became infected through their use of prescribed
medication in an earnest desire to maintain their health
 
22
and play an active role in society"
.
Third, the maintenance of the lives of people with
haemophilia would have been less expensive if
self-sufficiency had been achieved by 19
7
7, as Dr Owen
and the Medical Research Council said it would have
been.  As doctors frequently pointed out to Government,
if it stopped paying a lot of money for expensive
commercial blood products to US pharma, it would recoup
the capital cost of rebuilding BPL in a relatively short
period of time.
Fourth, had there been better co-operation between
the British and Scottish blood services
, 
and any
Governmental drive to use the fractionation capacity of
Liberton
, 
again, the lives of people with haemophilia
would have been less expensive.
And fifth, a person born with haemophilia doesn't
come with a set price tag attached.  It was within
Government's power to control the amount of taxpayers
'
money spent on them
.  
As other Core Participants have
pointed out, Government could have limited the amount of
money regions were allowed to spend on Factor VIII, or
made a decision not to fund prophylaxis or to limit home
treatment
, 
and it was Government's choice to move away
from cryo and move on to large pool concentrates.
So in 1979 we had the Department of Health
 
23
commissioning a study to look at the financial
contribution people with haemophilia could make by using
home treatment, working, and contributing to the
economy.  And 
six 
years later, in 1985, the Department
was taking into 
account
 the contribution they would make
to the cost of testing for AIDS by dying of AIDS.
People with haemophilia were vulnerable physically
and psychologically.  They grew up knowing that they
were expensive to treat.  Some of them had had shortages
of treatment or rationing.  They were deeply grateful
for cryo and the knowledge that their children were not
going to die in their twenties but live a long life.
And they were grateful again for concentrate and home
treatment.  
They
 were dependent on other people's
willingness to give blood, on taxpayer
s
, on continued
Government funding of the treatment that kept them alive
and healthy
.  
And from 1973, many of them were made
dependent on US commercial pharmaceutical companies.
Above all, they were dependent on their doctors
,
whom they trusted to act in their best interests in the
same way that the Society trusted Professor Arthur Bloom
and other members of its advisory 
panel
.
These were not relationships between equals and all
of these factors are the context for the decisions made
by the Society.
 
24
The next point is Government responsibility.
It's Government's responsibility to consult with
a section of the
 
population such as those with
a bleeding disorder and any charity that advocates for
their rights, but decisions about how to allocate
resources are for Government, not for patients and not
for little charities that represent patients.  What
medicines should be licensed for use in the NHS, whether
they should be manufactured by the NHS or private
companies, whether those companies should be based in
the UK or abroad, how much treatment is made available
to which patients, and where, these are decisions for
Government and for the NHS, not for patients.  That 
was
particularly the case in relation to the funding of
haemophilia care in the 
'60s
, 
'70s
 and 
'80s
, where there
was a distinct power imbalance and a patient dependency
and vulnerability
.
The duty of advising patients about whether they
needed a treatment with blood or a blood product, what
the choices were, what the treatment recommendation 
was
and why, the risks and benefits, that was the duty of
doctors.  It was not the duty of the Society.
So why did does the Society support the switch from
cryo 
to
 concentrate and support importation of US
products?  Very simply, cryo gave you a long life.

  25
Concentrate allowed you to live your life to the full.
What home treatment took away, and it's probably not
possible for those of us who don't have a bleeding
disorder to understand this, was the pain of an
untreated bleed, the fear of pain, and the spectre of
bleed
-
induced permanent disability.
In January 1972, the Society republished an
editorial from The Practitioner, a journal which is
primarily aimed at GPs
 -- 
which tells you something
about how widespread was the state of knowledge at that
time
 -- 
and 
the
 editorial talked the reader through the
work of J Garrott Allen in 1970 which identified the
fact that commercial blood is riskier than voluntary
blood.  And the piece in The Bulletin explained why
:
paid blood came from prisoners, people on skid row,
people addicted to drugs and alcohol.
So the Society knew that in 1972, before the first
US products were licensed in 1973, and it made that
knowledge available to anyone who read The Bulletin.
At the time, the NHS wasn't producing enough
cryoprecipitate or concentrate to meet the needs of
patients, and that was a concern to the Society.  The
Society didn't particularly mind what form the treatment
took so long as there was enough of it to go round, and
it did whatever it could to plug gaps in the NHS
 
26
provision.  There's a report in a 1974 Bulletin of the
Society offering a hospital assistance with volunteer
workers to help increase production of cryo, and the
response from the hospital was that that help might be
resented by technical staff and could result in
industrial action.
If you read The Bulletins of the time, there are
a host of examples, and we've given them in our written
submissions, of what the Society was doing to try to
make treatment available to people across the country,
providing 
home 
freezers and all sorts of things like
that.
In 1974, Dr Biggs published a letter in The Lancet
saying that there was a
 
shortage of treatment and that
90 per cent of UK patients were getting less than the
optimum treatment for their complaint.  Non-urgent
operations were being cancelled and there was a delay in
putting patients on home treatment.
In that context, the Society supported an increase
in the supply of concentrate, but there's 
no
 evidence
that it campaigned for licences to be issued so that
blood products could be imported from America.  The
minutes of the meetings of the Centre Directors in
October '72
 
and January '74
 
record that it was the
Centre Directors 
who were pressing for permission to do
 
27
that and that
, 
given the choice, none of the Centre
Directors preferred to use cryoprecipitate; they all
preferred to use concentrate
 
Factor VIII.
It was David Owen
 
who was the Health Minister when
American blood products were licensed for use in the NHS
in '73.  As he explains in his witness statement, he
knew what he was doing.  He 
had
 reviewed
 
Titmuss
' 
book
for the New Statesman in 1971 and he identified in his
review the fact that there was 
no
 moral, financial or
administrative case for using US products in the NHS.
He knew the risks to the bleeding disorder community
that he was sanctioning.  This was a stopgap measure
.
And when he made it possible for US blood products to
come into the country in '73, he committed the
Government to self-sufficiency by 1977.
That was the aim.  The problem was that the aim
wasn't achieved, and there was never a plan
 
B.  The
Society was concerned at the time that that date was
going to be missed.  It spoke to Dr Owen at the end of
1975, talked to him about what could be done, about
plasmapheresis, the regional structure of BTS and other
matters, and repeatedly expressed its concern about
increasing reliance on US commercial concentrates, but
nothing changed.
In his letter to the Archer Inquiry in August 2007,
 
28
Chris James, the Society's chief executive at the time,
summarised the efforts that the UKHCDO went to in 1977,
'78, and 1980.  That's ARCH0001014.
So in all of those years, the UKHCDO was trying to
impress on Government that it needed to hurry up with
self-sufficiency with the same lack of success.  So in
the early 
'70s 
there might have been some knowledge
amongst some members of the bleeding disorder community
that large pool concentrates had an increased hepatitis
risk
 
and that US products were worse than NHS ones, but
what you know and what you really get and understand are
two different things.
And the World in Action documentaries were eye
opening.  So this is a good point to replay part of the
second documentary broadcast in December 1975, where
patients, parents and the Society's Executive Committee
were asked for their reactions to the first broadcast,
which showed how blood was collected in the US on skid
row and the added risks of products.
Take it away, please, Lawrence.

I'm going to make two points in relation to
hepatitis NANB
, 
as it then was.  We've addressed this at
some length in our written submissions, and I'm not
going to say more than that about this issue now.
On Tuesday, Mr Snowden took you to Dr Walford's 1980
memo, where she captured the point, and her recently
acquired knowledge
, 
that 90 per cent of post-transfusion
hepatitis was of the NANB variety
 
and that it could be
rapidly 
fatal
.
  And, sir, you'll recall her evidence
that she escalated a communication of that knowledge up
the chain and 
sent
 her memo around the Department quite
widely and to her superiors
.
  So I won't take you back

  41
to that.
What I would ask us to do
,
 just very briefly
,
 is
then fast forward about 
seven
 years to Dr Smithies'
 
memo
of 17 February 1987
.  
That's DHSC0001383.  This is
a three-page document and this is the last page.
It's worth looking at in a little bit of detail
.
I
 
think we've looked at the first paragraph more than
once
, but the second paragraph is of interest as 
well
.
She talks about the
 "
finite number of haemophiliacs who
have contracted HIV infection
" -- 
and remember this is
February 1987, so significant numbers of people are
already
, 
in the haemophilia community
, 
dying of AIDS at
this point in the UK
 -- 
and
 
their position being
"
pitiful
"
, and having
 "
attracted great sympathy
"
, in
part because of the 
"
perceived stigma
"
.
It wasn't just perceived; it was objectively as well
as subjectively present.
Then she says:
"The equally sad fact 
that
 a number of haemophiliacs
will undoubtedly die of chronic hepatitis as a result of
non-A
 
non-B infection has not been recognised publicly."
Which suggests that it's been well known within the
Department privately but somehow not recognised
publicly.  So that's of concern.
Then a passing interest, she says -- she makes --
 
42
draws a parallel with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, and some patients being relieved of pain by using
those over-the-counter drugs.  And she says:
"I find it difficult to advocate that there are any
special circumstances surrounding the care of
haemophilia which makes their case for compensation
greater than that of other patients who take medicines
which kill them.  That is, of course, provided the
doctors caring for the patients have prescribed their
treatment in a proper manner."
A few points arise.  Number 
one, the 
last sentence
is a bit of a big "if" when it comes to infected blood.
The second is, it's a false equivalence between
anti-inflammatory drugs
, 
which one can choose a variety
of painkillers and buy over-the-counter, and infected
blood.  It smacks of whatabout
er
y.  There are so many
differences, it shouldn't be necessary to spell them
out.
AIDS at this time had a very 
high
 mortality rate.
Drugs that you can buy over the counter and take for
arthritis if you choose do so really didn't
.  
And it's
a paragraph that seems lacking in compassion and lacking
in a sense of the reality of people's lives in
February 1987.

If we keep that in mind -- you can take it off
the 
screen
.  Thank you, Lawrence.
If one goes forward eight months or so to
3
 
November 1987, that 
was
 the date when the then
minister in the Department, Mr John Moore, 
had
 the
memorable meeting with the Society
 -- 
and the DHSC in
its written submissions has reproduced some of the
evidence in that regard
 -- 
a memorable meeting with the
Society at which he was reduced to tears
.  
Because
attending this meeting were three young men who were
infected with HIV/AIDS who explained to him their fears
for themselves and their families
.  
And Mr Roger Moore,
the civil servant, explained that he'd never seen
somebody cry in a meeting before.
The Society would suggest that in a properly run
health system that was not disjoin
t
ed and siloed, the
Minister, Mr Moore, would have been told in preparation
for this meeting that infected blood had given people
with haemophilia not just AIDS, but also hepatitis NANB,
 
44
which could also be fatal, and from which a number of
them
, 
in Dr Smithies'
 
words earlier that year
, 
were
undoubtedly going to 
die
.
Given Mr John Moore's reaction to what he heard in
the meeting, it is reasonable to think that he would
have acted on 
information
 about that second killer virus
had he been told about it, as one might think he should
have been.
The second point, if we fast forward almost a decade
to the World in Action programmes
, 
which were a valuable
resource
, 
broadcast in October 1996
, 
with Lord
 Horam.
That's HSOC0008602.
The interviews with him are interesting on a
 
number
of counts, not least he gives the line oft repeated by
politicians since
, "
Well,
 we don't want to spend money
on compensation
, 
it would be much better if we used that
money for the wider community", at the same time
refusing to fund recombinant, so not using the money
saved by not paying compensation for the benefit of the
wider community.
But he's also asked about hepatitis C
, 
as it was
then called.  It was put to him in October 1996 by the
programme that £26 million had been spent on research on
AIDS and just £1 million on researching -- this is
what's put to him -- "the hepatitis epidemic which

  45
scientists believe could affect more than ten times as
many
".  
And Lord Horam's response to that was, "
We are
not talking about those sort of numbers
".  
And by that
he meant the number of people who were going to be
infected with hepatitis C, not the amount of money.
One might think that if the fact
s
 that Dr Smithies
was aware of
 
and that were known within the Department
in 1987 had been recognised publicly at that time, there
ought to have been a less dismissive response by the
Minister in 199
6
, and there would not have been a decade
of lost opportunity for properly funded research,
learning, and improved patient care.
In our written submissions, we've set out a lot of
the activity that the Society was engaged on in and
around hepatitis C in the 1990s and the campaign that
was started, and where that led to eventually after
a lot of 
hard
 pushing.
Sir, I'm going to deal briefly with some
miscellaneous matters
, 
and they are litigation
,
hepatitis C, and the tone that the Society has adopted
from time to time over the years.
The Society is aware that there is some dismay about
the position it took in relation to litigation over HIV
infections and its communication to Government of its
stance.  The documents indicated that when it first
 
46
asked the Government for financial help for people with
haemophilia infected with AIDS, the Government's
response was that it only pays compensation where there
is fault, and it therefore invited infected people with
haemophilia to sue.  That's there in a document,
HSO
C
0003459
, 
and I'll come on later in these submissions
to talk about the Government's response to people who
have been affected by some of the Cumberlege medicines
and devices, particularly those affected by mesh and
sodium valproate
, 
which has been exactly the same.  That
might be 
good
 evidence, you might think, that that was
the Government's response in the 1980s
, 
since that
remains the Government's response in the 2020s.
Litigation was only open to those who had Legal Aid
or enough money to pay lawyers, and that left many
people with haemophilia in the middle.  They didn't have
insufficient money to qualify for Legal Aid and they
didn't have enough money to pay privately for
representation, so they couldn't bring a claim.  The
Society was painfully aware that people were dying and
it didn't want to use what little energy and time they
had left on legal proceedings, so the Society's aim was
to get something for everyone infected
 
as quickly as
possible.
To do that, it pursued a campaign and later ones on
 
47
moral not legal grounds
, 
and that was an
 
unusual tactic
driven by necessity.  The Society 
had
 had advice from
a barrister that any claim it brought on behalf of the
charity was unlikely to succeed
 
and
, 
in
 
addition, money
was needed within the timescales of the dying, not
within the timescales of litigation.  That would take
years, which people didn't have.
Convincing Government to take this unusual moral
case seriously required an
 
explanation of both reasons
as to why litigation 
was
 not an
 
option.  After the
Macfarlane 
£10
 million
 
had been secured
, 
the Society
pressed on with a second campaign for the same reason:
that infected people needed money urgently.  The Society
notes the witness statement of Lord Frank Field who
wrote to you of his own volition, in which he described
his work with David Watters to get adequate compensation
for infected haemophiliacs so they didn't have to start
court action, and the media campaign they collaborated
on with the Sunday Times.
In November 1989
, 
the Government offered a further
£24 million, including payments of £20,000 each to each
person infected or their family of those who had 
died
.
There 
was
 pressure exerted by MPs acting on behalf of
the Government at an all-party meeting on 30
 
November
1989 to compel acceptance of that offer
, 
and Lord Field
 
48
recalls in his statement being "knocked over by the
violence of the language used".
At that point
, 
over 100 people had died of infected
blood products and the litigation wasn't scheduled to
start until 1991
, 
by which time many more would have
died.
After the award of the ex gratia payment, the number
of claimants into the litigation increased because many
people used all or some of their £20,000 payment to fund
joining the litigation.  So the Society launched another
media offensive for out
-
of
-
court compensation, and it
did so despite Dr Kernoff, who 
was
 sitting on its
Medical Advisory Panel, advising the Society against
becoming involved on the ground
s 
that "People might
start suggesting that people with haemophilia are 
too
greedy".  The reference for that is HSOC0010954.
As you know, settlement of the court action was
reaching after Mr Justice Ognall's intervention in
June 1990 where he repeatedly referred to a moral duty.
Much later, in June 2018 
--
 I think that must be
2008 -- Mr Graham Ross, the solicitor who acted for 
very
many of the claimants, appeared before the Archer
Inquiry, and he explained how the settlement had been
achieved at some length.  In his evidence, he appeared
appreciative of the Society's efforts to assist the

  49
litigation, and the Society notes the statement of Sir
Rupert
 
Jackson
, 
who was then junior counsel for the
claimants in the litigation.  He says that the case 
was
very worrying, that plaintiffs were dying every month,
that by the time of the settlement
 
148 patients had
died, and the case "faced significant difficulties on
liability and causation".
He described the central defendants as
"
intransigent
"
, and said in his view "It is unfortunate
that the Government of the day did not face up to its
moral responsibility in the same way that the present
Government has
", 
at which point, after yesterday, we
might say 
"
up to a point, Lord Co
o

.
Turning to hepatitis C.  The Society is painfully
aware that there are a number of infected and affected
people who 
feel
 that it did 
too
 little 
too
 late and it
wasn't there for the community at a time of need.  The
Society has done its best to respond to those concerns
in two very lengthy witness statements made by its
current chief executive, Kate Burt.  I think only one of
them has just been made available.
As she says in those statements, the Society hears
you, deeply regrets that you 
feel
 let down
 
and would
welcome the opportunity to listen to those who 
feel
harmed.  The mid-'90s were a time of crisis for the
 
50
charity.  Those running it were exhausted by campaigning
and the organisation was on the brink of bankruptcy.
Some of the trustees felt that the Society wasn't
representing them and they'd achieve more from the
outside than they could from the inside and they set up
their own campaigns
.
The documents referred to by 
Ms
 Burt show that there
was a considerable amount of working together, but
there's 
no
 doubt that these splits were painful and sad.
Everybody wanted the same thing, but it may be that the
combined effect of different tactics taken by different
campaigners was greater than one single campaign would
have been.  The Society felt it had a responsibility to
the whole of the bleeding disorder community, and one
can see that
 
in its attempts to meet everyone's needs,
thereby perhaps pleasing nobody
 
and dissatisfying
a cross-section of the membership
.
If we look briefly at a page from the 1998 Bulletin,
WITN6392059 at page 10.
Squidgy print
, 
which I hope you can read.
This is a letters page.
Lawrence, I don't know if you can just put the whole
page on so that people can see what it
 -- 
there
, 
it
looks like that.
It's printing three letters which are a response to
 
51
the chair of the Hampshire Group.  If we look at the top
left, this is from Stan Cockburn, the chair of the Manor
House Group.  And the writer of the article that these
letters are responding to is Mary 
Clarke
.  And he says:
"She
 is 
concerned that the Society will 
divide
 into
different groups.  I must ask, is she living in the
clouds?  The Society is already split into several
groups
: 
we have haemophiliacs who have received a very
derisory payment for being infected with HIV.  We have
young people who will be receiving recombinant products
now coming on
 
line
, 
as they should.  What have the
people of my own generation been given?  Absolutely
nothing."
And in the last paragraph of that letter
: 
"... [
the
]
 Editorial stated that the HCV campaign
has highlighted the 
need
 for better treatment for
hepatitis patients.  This lesson should have been learnt
from the HIV campaign and not as an afterthought.
"
The editor's reply is
:
"
We need to help everyone with haemophilia.  All
those I speak to agree that 
we
 must continue the HCV
campaign and we shall.  However, I would like to see all
of us helping each other and not just following our own
particular needs."
I think you can see how that is both a reasonable
 
52
response and
, 
for those with particular needs and
infections
, 
an unreasonable one.  It's the Society
trying to please all of the people all of the time and
failing to do so.
Then we've got 
another 
letter
 
if we look at the
bottom of the left-hand column
:
"
Wake up
, 
Mrs 
Clarke
.  The haemophilia community has
been divided ever since some people receive viral
infections through their contaminated treatment.  We
shall continue to be divided until we can secure safe
treatment for all and until there is some recognition by
the Government that they have a moral obligation to us."
Then at the end of this letter
:
"
There have been far 
too
 many mistakes made at the
expense of haemophiliacs and we need to shout about it."
I'll say some more about the Society's campaigning
tone in a moment
.
And lastly, you get a letter from a different
perspective.
"I
 have 
been married for 30 years to a man with
haemophilia
.  [
He
]
 
is 
now 63 and one of the few
haemophiliacs who did
 not 
contract HIV.  He
 has 
now been
told he
 is [

]
 positive
 ... 
I 
feel
 this letter
from Mary 
Clarke
 points to the fact that people like
[
him
]
 have been forgotten.  We 
feel
 
guilty
 that he ONLY

suffers so far from bleeds."
And in the last paragraph:
"There must be many other haemophiliacs like

who 
feel
 they cannot approach the Society
because they only have haemophilia."

For this, we unreservedly
apologise.
"
The submissions of some 
other 
infected and affected
Core Participants make it clear that some people 
feel
that does not go far enough.
Now, there's a risk that the Society will sound like
the DHSC, and I hope you won't take what I'm now going
to say in that same way.  The point of the Inquiry for
the Society is multiple, but one of the points is to
listen to Sir Brian's objective and fully informed
judgment, and that will be an
 
important part of the
learning it does about itself in the past and now.
The Society thinks that it makes sense to reflect on
his findings before it says any more than it said in
2017.  It will then have the benefit of something that
is considered
 
and not the Society marking its own
homework, but listening to a proper examiner and
a thought
ful
 dissection of what it got right and what it
got wrong.
The Society said this in its written submissions:
that it would like to say to the Inquiry and to each
person infected and affected by contaminated blood that
it was not separate to its members.  It was its members.
It was run by patients for patients.  Those who formed
the Executive Committee were individuals who shared with
 
58
the members they served the same group of doctors and
such 
information
, advice, choices and treatments as were
made available to them all.  They suffered or watched
the children they loved suffer the same appalling
treatment
-
induced illnesses and deaths and the Society
doesn't seek not to be judged.  It does seek to be
judged in this light.
Throughout the Inquiry, the Society and its trustees
and staff, many of whom are here 
today
, have made it
their mission to listen and build bridges while
remaining sensitive to those who need distance from it.
That any member of the bleeding disorder community
should need such distance remains a source of profound
sadness to the Society, and it hopes to be able to
rebuild trust and work together in the future.  The
Society would encourage anyone who has not had the
opportunity to do so to look at Kate Burt's statements,
and those add to the statements made by others who have
provided evidence to the Society.
On behalf of everyone at the charity, Clive Smith,
who you know and who is here, and Kate Burt, who you may
not know
 
but who is also here
 -- 
please do go and say
hello.  Kate, perhaps you'd like to put your hand in the
air.
We hear you and we invite you and 
hope
 you will 
feel
 
59
able to talk to us
 
or continue to talk to us.  The
Society hopes that this period of time between now and
the report's 
publication
 and the setting up of the
compensation framework and the legal and psychological
support structures that need to accompany it could be
a time of healing.
It would like to pay tribute to the infected blood
campaigners who have given such a large part of their
lives up to the fight for justice.  These include the
Manor House Group, the Birchgrove Group, Tainted Blood,
the contaminated blood campaign, positive women,
Haemophilia Action UK, Haemophilia Scotland, Haemophilia
Wales, the Scottish Infected Blood Forum, Haemophilia
Northern Ireland, Friends and Families of Haemophilia
Northern Ireland, the Fatherless Generation
 
and
Factor
 8, 
alongside many other groups and charities and
individuals without whom we would never have seen this
Inquiry take place.
We particularly remember those campaigners who did
not live to see 
the
 end of the Inquiry.  Thank you
.
We turn lastly to the future and to recommendations.
We've covered these extensively in written submissions
and I've got written down on paper in front of me
a number of lists.
I will sum
ma
rise things as briefly as I can but our
 
60
submissions were supported by the results of a survey of
the membership
 
and their priorities and needs.  One of
the things that those responding to the Society's survey
were clear about -- and I think this is something that
everybody here will share -- is the fact that they were
very clear that annual payments must continue.  The
Society was pleased to see that Sir
 
Robert's report is
called 
Compensation and Redress for the Victims of
Infected Blood
.  
It
 agrees with Mr Snowden that language
is important.  Use of words such as "hardship" and
"recompense
", 
and so on
, 
have led to confusion about the
purpose of monies made available, restrictions on
payments out, and 
the
 widespread feeling among
applicants that they have had to beg for 
s
craps
.
It is appropriate for the new financial payments
,
which will be made as a
 
result of this financial
Inquiry
, 
to be called what they are: compensation.
The Society repeats what it's called for in
submission to any compensation scheme that's established
and here comes the list
: 
Anyone who has been significantly affected, having
the right to make a claim
; 
To continue existing support schemes alongside
a compensation scheme;
Compensation to be sufficiently personalised to

ensure it reflects the loss and damage served by
an
 
individual with a framework that should include set
tariffs to allow a faster but robust system for those
who want to take that route;
A fast track to an
 
emergency payment for those in
urgent need;
An
 
upfront lump sum to be paid to the infected and
affected community in advance of the full amount;
A clear, straightforward process which is easy to
use;
Specialist support for people making applications,
particularly where evidence has been lost or destroyed;
The claims should be approved on 
the 
balance of
probabilities with the starting point being that the
evidence of the applicant is believed; total parity
across devolved nations;
A compensation package funded by the Westminster
Government because this scandal happened before
devolution;
A system
 
which allows transfer of 
information
 from
supported administrators to schemes to reduce the burden
on claimants to provide 
information
;
A transparent appeal system;
Previous payments not to be taken into
consideration;
 
62
Inclusion of non-financial elements in the
compensation package
, 
such as psychological support,
health passporting
 
and Government underwritten life
insurance;
Financial advice available to all receiving
compensation;
An
 
individual assessment by a judge-led pan
el 
with
representation from the community, if people choose that
route; and
To widen eligibility to include impact from viruses
or exposure outside the current 
support 
schemes
, 
such as
hepatitis B and vCJD.
Accessibility.  A significant number of eligib
le
Society members are older.  They don't have smartphones.
They don't have tablets or computers
, 
they prefer to get
information
 on paper in the post
 
and they are
traumatised by their infections.  They've had to fill
these forms out time and again
 
and they can't face the
idea that they'll have to do it 
once
 more.  They don't
want to have to handle any more administrative tasks
themselves.  They need help.
The Inquiry has heard a substantial body of evidence
about the hurt caused by the administration of the
schemes, the future arrangements must be characterised
by respect and compassion.
 
63
UK support -- sorry, the Society supports the
submission by the UKHCDO at paragraph 262 of its closing
submissions about compensation for those who have
cleared infection with hepatitis C spontaneously
.
Psychological support.  The 
publication
 of the
Inquiry's report will be the start of a new chapter and
the risk that vulnerable individuals will be left to
cope alone again.  That mustn't be allowed to happen.
It is unfortunate that the start of the new framework
will come at a time when the country's finances are in
poor shape and public sector workers are on strike.  The
Society hopes that the Inquiry will make it clear that
one of the lessons to be learned from 
the contaminated
blood scandal 
is that denial of injustice and
postponement of financial responsib
ility 
while
generations suffer is a false economy.  Late
compensation costs more than timely and adequate redress
when people are ill and dying, and carers and dependants
are most in need of the money
, 
and the Society hopes,
Sir Brian, that you might be able to get across the very
simple message: delay doesn't pay.
Non-financial recommendations.  In common with many
of the other Core Participants, the Society made
recommendations on public inquiry reform, redress for
avoidable harm, consent, continuing scrutiny of
 
64
recommendation implementation, the Irish experience,
access to current treatment and up-to-date 
information
,
ongoing longer term assistance, research on future care
and palliative care, training and education, education
about the scandal itself
 
and an
 
apology and a memorial.
We repeat all of those
 
and
, 
today
, we wish to say
a little more about treatment and 
information
 for the
bleeding disorder community, and something about public
inquiry reform, redress, consent
 
and candour.  Before
turning to those areas, a word about follow-up and
delivery.
At the beginning of these submissions, I spoke about
the need for a formal framework to ensure that the
Government's 
feet
 are held to the fire.  The Patient
Safety Commission
er Dr 
Hughes has said that her motto is
"Speak up, listen up, follow up
".  
It may be that for
matters within her remit, it could be appropriate to
recommend 
that
 she be entrusted with the work of
following up delivery, perhaps including regular
progress reports.  Alternative mechanisms include
adjourning the Inquiry, post-
publication
 of the report,
with
 the recommendation that the chair review
implementation 
of accepted recommendations within
a given time period, and the possibility of
a supplemental report commenting on the success or

  65
otherwise of the implementation in the interim
, 
plus or
minus a recommendation that the implementation of
recommendations in the final report be reviewed by the
Cross
-
Party Health and Social Care Committee on
a regular basis with consequent reports to Parliament.
This appears to be what is happening in relation to
follow-up of Cumberlege, and when I'm not pinging her
about Woman's Hour, I like 
to
 
ping
 
Ms
 Richards with
entertaining videos of the Select Committee in progress.
It's her choice 
as
 
to
 which she prefers.
Given the work that Dr Hughes has said she will be
doing to follow up redress for those affect
ed
 by the
Cumberlege Review Medicines and Devices, the Society
hopes it 
may 
be possible for this Inquiry to liaise with
her about what
, 
if any
, 
infected blood matters may fall
within her remit.
Access to current treatment and up-to-date
information
.  The Society endorses paragraph 264 of the
UKHCDO closing submissions
, 
and those are about
provision of comprehensive care, including a core team
of physicians, clinical nurse specialists,
psychologists, physiotherapists, lab scientists and
social workers -- I'm quoting from their submissions
now -- and other experts who address disease related to
issues and complications
, 
including he
p
atologist
 
66
obstetricians, gynaecologists, orthopaedic and dental
consultants.
Peer
 review has identified a persistent lack of
a 
full compliment 
of 
multi-disciplinary team members
that has gone uncorrected
, 
despite having been
identified by previous peer review reports.  These
deficiencies
 ultimately arise from inadequate funding of
Haemophilia Centre infrastructure.
It would be nice
, 
at a minimum, for your care to be
properly funded.
The Irish experience.  
Brian
 O'Mahony told this
Inquiry that after compensation, the Health Amendment
Act card
, 
and knowledgeable, compassionate liaison
officers or case managers 
were 
the recommendations that
have proved most valuable over time, as infected people
age and their needs change.  That experience should
inform, we suggest, the package of measures put into
place to support the future welfare of infected and
affected people.
We ask you to make a recommendation that all those
infected by blood and blood products and all people with
a bleeding disorder
 
have access to 
information
 relevant
to them about their condition and new treatments to be
provided through haemophilia centres
; 
guaranteed access
to recombinant
 -- 
you may be surprised to hear that
 
67
there are still some rare bleeding disorders where
people are reliant on treatment made from human blood
and not synthetic treatments
 -- 
a choice of treatment to
suit lifestyle
; 
and guaranteed access to new therapies
including gene therapy
; 
guaranteed access 
to
a
 multi-disciplinary care package
, 
including
psychological services, pain 
management
 and
physiotherapy
; 
and a quality of access to care including
dental treatment and
, 
specifically
, 
endoscopies.
The Society does not ask for its members or for the
community the ability to queue jump.  It does ask for
a recommendation for a health passport that helps the
infected and affected communicate their history and
their needs quickly
, 
so that they can get the help that
they need effectively
, 
without having to go through the
whole story from start to finish.
In its written submissions, the Society asks for
recommendations on longer term assistance, research on
future care and palliative care, training and education,
and 
an
 
apology and memorial.  I'm not going to consider
those now
 
but they're of equal importance to things I am
talking about, and 
we commend
 those submissions to you.
On a separate topic, and I shared this 
information
with 
Ms
 Richards and Ms Scolding, King's Counsel,
yesterday
, 
the Society has very 
recently 
received
 
68
information
 about hepatitis C and funeral arrangements.
In November last year, it was told about an
 
embalmer who
last year refused the touch the body of a man with
von Willebrand's disease who was thought to have been
infected by blood and had cleared the virus many years
before he died last year.
I'm very grateful to the research that's done by the
Leigh Day team.  They have uncovered relevant 2018
Health and Safety Executive regulations and it would
seem, from this 2022 experience, that those are not as
widely known about as they should be.
I am hopeful that 
Ms Sc
olding and her solicitors
will have more to say about this in due course and
I will leave this issue to them
.
Turning to public inquiry reform.  There's 
no
 test
for deciding when a public inquiry should be held.
Alan Milburn described the current framework as "pretty
non-existen
t 
or 
wool
ly".  Successive ministers
'
 denial
of requests for a public inquiry were based on their
acceptance of the line they were given by the civil
servants who were supposed to be helping them, that
there 
was
 
no
 negligence
.  
And that was even when one
minister, Caroline
 
Flint, was in receipt of
correspondence from the Society that spelt out the fact
that patients had been treated without their consent and

experimented upon.  Further, that patients were given
the best treatment available, and anyway, even if they
hadn't, all the lessons had been learned.
The history of inadequate co-operation with Archer,
the defensive, insufficiently objective self-sufficiency
report, and the delay in setting up this Inquiry
 
are all
evidence that a clear and transparent mechanism for
making decisions about when to hold a public inquiry, or
a non-statutory review, would be extremely helpful if
not required.  The Society suggests a recommendation is
made that there be an independent body with the power to
convene a public inquiry
 -- 
that would require an
amendment to the Inquiries Act
 -- 
or a recommendation to
the relevant minister that a public inquiry be held.
Such an independent body could be charged with
applying transparent criteria to assess the
circumstances in which inquiries or reviews must be
held.  And it could collate them so that there's
a central repository of recommendations, monitor which
recommendations are accepted by Government
 
and how the
implementation works out, and
, 
in appropriate
circumstances, require inquiry chairs to review such
implementation as there has been.
The Society also feels that there is a specific need
to say something about a requirement that the
 
70
decision-maker meets victims in person.
Sir, you've heard evidence from Mr Burnham and
Mr Jeremy Hunt that both were actively counselled by
civil servants against meeting in person those who were
campaigning for public inquiries.  You'll remember
I think -- I think it was Mr Hunt said he'd been
counselled against meeting Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.
The Society considers that this sort of a meeting is
essential.  You've heard at least three examples of
individuals being profoundly moved and having their
views changed by meeting infected and affected people
:
John Moore, who we've already discussed, in 1977
;
Mr Hunt 
in
 his interaction with Mr Dorricott and his
family
; 
Andy Burnham meeting Eleanor and Fred Bates and
realising that something was very wrong.  There's 
no
substitute for the decision-maker hearing in person from
those who are suffering and seeking just
ice
.  There
shouldn't be a filtering by civil servants.
It
 submits 
that however decisions about whether to
hold or not hold a public inquiry or statutory review
are made in future, an in-person meeting should be
a mandatory part of the 
decision-making
 process.
Candour, redress and consent.  These three
overlapping concepts, which together form a virtuous
circle
, 
if you remove any one of them, the circle
 
71
collapses.  Jeremy Hunt and Baroness Cumberlege are
advocates for a move from our current adversarial system
of negligence
, 
where the burden is on you, the infected
or injured person, to prove not only that something went
wrong but that the injury you've suffered was caused by
what went wrong, and a switch from that to a 
no
-fault
system, or one of redress for avoidable harm caused by
systems failure.
First Do No Harm
 considered the three medical
devices and medicines we've looked at.  And on the face
of it, they have 
no
 connection to blood.  But her
observations about candour, patient safety, redress and
the 
need for a cultural shift in the NHS are highly
relevant.  She explained in her report that the duty of
candour appears not to have had the desired effect of
increasing reporting and disclosure, and we draw the
Inquiry's attention to paragraphs 2.47 to 2.51 of her
report.
In 2.51 she said this:
"We believe that a cultural shift away from blame is
needed to create a healthcare system where people are
open and honest.  We outline how we 
feel
 a 
no
-blame
,
systems-based approach to delivering redress as
a substitute for litigation could drive this shift in
paragraphs 2.37 to 2.39 
(... [and] 
Appendix 3
)
.  We
 
72
believe this shift is essential to deliver a safer NHS
where healthcare professionals have 
no
 reason to fear
being candid and telling the truth to their patients."
Her solution was a redress agency
: 
a non-adversarial
process with determinations based on avoidable harm,
looking at systemic failings.
The Government rejected that recommendation
outright.  Its July 2021 response to her report was that
those suffering from sodium valproate and pelvic mesh
wanting compensation would have to bring 
legal
proceedings.  Exactly the same response it gave to you
over AIDS in the 1980s and over hepatitis C in the
1990s.
One of the reasons it rejected the recommendation
was, said 
the
 Government, that it already has the
ability to set up support schemes
.  
And the best example
that it could come up with was the -- this is how it
phrases it -- "
infected blood 
support scheme".  The only
inference that we can draw from the Government's
reference to that
 -- 
and we assume that that is
a reference to EIBSS, and this 
is 
a reliance in
July 2021 on EIBSS as some sort of model of good
practice -- is that the Government 
actually
 thinks that
the infected blood support schemes provided or provide
an example of redress done 
well
, so that we don't need

  73
to change anything.
That suggestion flies in the face of all the
evidence hea
rd 
in this Inquiry by those of you who
utilise the schemes.  It suggests that the Government
doesn't know about or hasn't been listening to the
evidence of users given to this Inquiry.  You've
provided abundant evidence of the adverse effect on you
of the lack of any financial assessment of your losses
and needs, psychological harm caused by different
treatment of the infected and affected in the devolved
nations, divisive means testing, needless complexity and
opacity, applications being dealt with and basic errors
being made or applicants being disbelieved, onerous
requirements for evidence, unexplained exclusion of
bereaved parents, the lack of any proper voice of the
infected and affected within the administration, and the
conflict between users in dire need and administrators
who hold back large reserves of monies intended to be
paid out.
Second
, 
the Government's July 2021 response failed
to acknowledge or even refer to the oral evidence of
Mr Hancock.  He gave evidence to the Inquiry on
21 May 2021, and he accepted that the trusts and schemes
had been run without there being "a proper process
around coming to a fair and just way of ensuring that
 
74
people are supported", so it's surprising that there's
no
 reference to that a couple of months later when the
Government responded to Cumberlege in July
.
The Government has set up two litigation gateways
for those harmed by the medicines and devices that
Baroness Cumberlege looked at.  You can go down the
normal route where you instruct your own lawyers, and
they get on with the business of litigating.
Alternatively, you can ask the Government to
investigate, and this is what happens.  The Government's
solicitors will provide the Government with a report.
The Government will look at its own report, and it will
either admit liability and pay compensation to you, or
it will deny liability.  Either way the Government will
not release its report to you, and you can see these
gateways set out on a web
 
page
resolution.nhs.uk/v
aginal
mesh.
That approach is consistent with an adversarial
system in which each 
side
 can claim privilege and
withhold the expert advice it's received.  It's a legal
process geared towards establishing blame, not an open
and transparent patient
 safety 
driven process aimed at
establishing the harm that's been caused, how it could
have been avoided, and what needs to change.
And you have to wonder
, 
where the report obtained by
 
75
Government through its alternative litigation gateway
tells the Government that it needs to admit liability
and pay compensation, why should not the person who has
been harmed by its negligence see that report?  One
answer could be a concern by Government that that
individual might then share that report with other
injured patients.
So this is not a system for learning; it's a system
for being defensive.
There are signs that the Government may be having
a change of heart.  In this Woman's Hour interview on
3
 January, Dr Hughes told the BBC that the Health
Minister has asked her to look into redress for the
Cumberlege victims, if I call them that, and Dr Hughes
is looking for a commitment from the Government that it
will provide that redress.  One didn't get the
impression that she'd had the answer she was looking for
at that stage.
But these
 patients shouldn't have to fight the NHS
and the Government any more than you should have to.
A fair, predictable, swiftly responsible system for
redress is an idea whose time has come.  And a further
advantage is that it could be a Centre of Excellence for
financial redress frameworks.  The delay that you are
enduring
 
while the cross party working 
group
 responds to
 
76
Sir
 
Robert's detailed scheme
 
could be 
minimised
 for
others in future, because there would be 
well
-run
schemes that could be adapted quickly to suit the needs
of different groups of people avoid
ably 
injured by
systems failures.
Consent.  
The 
Cumberlege Review's findings
demonstrate that there's still quite a 
lot
 going wrong.
Doctors are 
too
 ready
,
 still
,
 to make assumptions about
what patients want, or adopt the position that they know
what is in their patients' best interests.  They're
still overselling benefits, underselling burdens, and
not being clear enough about that which is uncertain and
that which is unknown.  They're particularly bad about
giving balanced advice about medical products where
there's 
no
 consensus about the risks, and therefore 
no
consensus about how you should weigh up the benefits and
burdens.
The Society notes, 
for
 
example
, paragraph 5.41 of
First Do No Harm
.  That records that
 
as late as 2014,
the MHRA was maintaining in a report it produced at the
request of the Chief Medical Officer that the benefits
of mesh outweighed the risks.  The Cumberlege Review
found that that stance did not fully reflect an
understanding of all the risks, and it affirmed the
evidence of one campaigner that "the real world evidence

  77
and patient stories of harms have been
 
overlooked"
.
The Society invites you, sir, to consider the
informed consent section of the Government's response to
that review and consider whether its actions for
improvement go far enough.
Publication
 of this Inquiry's report might also
provide an opportunity to recommend ongoing monitoring
of implementation of, 
for
 
example
, the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence's shared
decision making guideline, and importantly, the extent
to which patients are routinely made aware that they
have the right to record a discussion with a doctor if
they wish to do so
, 
and the extent to which patients are
taking up that 
opportunity
 and measure the effect.
A study on those matters could be beneficial.
The Civil Service.  A few words about the
Civil Service
, 
which has not been an ally to those
harmed by infected blood in your search for truth.  We'd
like to say an extended bit, if we might, about the
Government's 2006 self-sufficiency report.
The Society has been dismayed to read the statement
of Peter Burgin, the author of the Government
self-sufficiency report
 -- 
the original author, I should
say
 -- 
and his statement is dated 15 December 2022.
Since it was made available the day before written
 
78
submissions were due to be filed, it wasn't a matter
that we were able to deal with in written submissions.
This is the story.  He completed his report and
delivered 
the
 final draft on Christmas Eve 2002.  He
says in his statement that in preparation for his report
he had a meeting with the Society
, 
and he describes that
as having been extremely helpful.  After he delivered
his report, the Department of Health paid some
consultants -- we don't know who or very much about
them -- to amend the report.  The amended draft was sent
to clinicians and others -- again, we're not sure who --
for their comments prior to 
publication
.  It was not
sent
 to the Society prior to 
publication
.
The Department published the report
 
which it 
had
 had
amended without telling Mr Burgin, and Mr Burgin only
found out that the report, the original version of which
he
 
drafted in 2002
, 
had been published
 
in 2018.
If you look at his witness statement, which I'll
recommend
, 
WITN7485001, he provides a table with
a comparison of what he wrote in 2002
, 
and the amended
document 
was
 published in 2006.  That effectively shows
that his report was, to use the modern expression, sexed
up by the consultants employed by the Government.  The
references to the Society appealing to Government not to
ban imports of American imported product despite
 
79
allegedly knowing of the risk of NANB hepatitis were
added without his knowledge
.
So far as the Society can 
see -- 
we could be wrong
but don't think
 so -- 
Mr Burgin's statement to this
Inquiry is the first time that the then professor
Frank Hill is identified as a contributor to his work.
There are footnotes referring to Mr Burgin's interview
with Chris Hodgson and his interview with Dr Mark
Winter, and there is a reference to reports from
Dr Hill, but 
no
 mention of an
 
interview with him.  We
assume, but we don't know, that when Mr Burgin
approach
ed 
Dr Hill to assist with the self-sufficiency
report, 
Dr Hill
 did not disclose to him the fact that
a negligence claim brought on behalf of one of his child
patients
, 
whom he had infected with HIV through
contraindicated prescription of Factor VIII
 
rather than
cryoprecipitate
, 
had been settled at trial in 1992.
Had
 
the
 published self-sufficiency report included
a list of contributors, the Buggins family, and perhaps
the Society, would have had additional grounds to
challenge it.  Had Dr Hill learned any lessons from the
case brought against him
 
and had he been open and honest
with Mr Burgin, Mr Burgin would have been given direct
evidence that at least one cohort of child patients may
not have been given the best treatment available at the
 
80
time
 
but
, 
instead, it was possible for Professor Hill to
cover up his wrongdoing and mislead the original author
of the Government's own internal review
 
and
, 
I say
again, an
 
internal review that it did not share with the
Society in draft before publishing it.
Importantly, we also see history repeating itself.
It was 
through
 the good offices of Elisabeth Buggins
that 
it was drawn to my 
attention
 why it is likely that
Mr 
Burgin went to Professor Hill.  We don't know and so
it may be that you wish to ask Mr Burgin, I don't know.
Mr
 Kennedy, King's Counsel, has been kind enough to
confirm the facts for me, but in 2002, Professor Hill
,
as he then was, was the chair of the UKHCDO
, 
so it seems
likely that he 
was
 interviewed in his capacity as the
head of that organisation.
One sees alarming parallels with what happened with
Professor
 
Bloom, who, as a
 
result of being perhaps the
chair of the UKHCDO, was then asked to sit on almost
every other committee
 
and had a finger in almost every
other blood products pie, and we see the damage that
that overreliance on one single individual caused.
It's a pity that there wasn't a wider breadth of
interviewees, perhaps.  It is no fault of Mr Burgin's.
He did the best that he 
could
 in the circumstances and
was not to know otherwise.

  81
The whole history of that report, its amendment, its
publication
 without any consultation with those 
who'd
contributed to
 
it
 
and an
 
opportunity to comment or
correct inaccuracies, is a good illustration of what can
happen when there is 
no
 enforceable duty on civil
servants to behave with candour, openness
 
and
transparency.  There's 
no
 incentive for patient groups
to assist Government with report writing if this sort of
process is 
considered
 appropriate
 
and
, 
worse, patient
advocacy charities would be wise to distrust Government
or civil servants and not engage
.
Outside the NHS
 
and the Care Quality Commission
regulated care facilities, there's 
no
 mechanism for
enforcement of ethical standards in public service.
Lord Evans explained to the Inquiry on 9 November last
year
, 
that the Seven Principles are not themselves
enforceable in a compliance sense but they give a very
clear steer as to the way that individual public
servants of any sort 
should
 be behaving
 
and
, 
against
that background, accountability is pretty meaningless
unless you have openness of 
information
, because you
can't call somebody to 
account
 if the facts are not
known.
Well
, quite.
Without 
information
, there's 
no
 consent, 
no
 
82
accountability, 
no
 redress.  So the Society, having read
Mr Burgin's witness statement, makes the following
additional recommendations in addition to the
introduction of a formal duty of 
candour
 for civil
servants
: 
that
 all Government reports should bear the
name of the author
; that
 where individuals have
contributed, there should be a list of contributors
; 
and
that all contributors should be able to see a report in
draft before it is published and given the opportunity
to correct inaccuracies.
I move now to my conclusion.
After your report is published, if not before, there
will be further work to do.  All of the contaminated
blood infected and affected must get every penny of
compensation to which they're entitled
, 
the support they
need to obtain it, quick and smooth access to the
treatment and psychological support needed in the
future.  
No
 one should 
feel
 alone or traumatised by the
process
 or unable to cope with more administrative
burdens
, 
and the Society will be there for every person
within the bleeding disorder community who feels it
could help them.
Addressing the devastating impact of the scandal and
campaigning for improvements for everyone in the
community has been a central part of the Society's work
 
83
for the last 40 years.  It fully expects that work to
continue for the foreseeable future
 
and after what will
be a landmark report.
This vital Inquiry has opened up conversations
within 
families about what happened and that 
has been
welcome.  It has also create
d
 need for even more
support.  For some, the relief of being able to speak
truthfully about the past has been a healing 
process
.
But for others, and particularly younger generations
perhaps who may have a bleeding disorder themselves,
discovering that their family history has been based on
half-truths and omissions has been difficult to come to
terms with.  Some people thought they had put a dark and
painful time in their life behind them
, 
and are now
revisiting the past and finding that it remains
traumatic.
Others didn't realise the extent to which their
consultant had withheld 
information
 from them, and are
only
 now learning about that, and beginning to 
process
such a grave breach of trust.  The Society will always
be a safe place for anyone in the community impacted by
this scandal, a charity that people of any age, gender
and race can turn to, confident of a knowledgeable
empathetic response, practical help where possible, and
informed, robust advocacy if the support they need is
 
84
still lacking.
My last words are
, 
again
, 
from the Bishop
 
Jone
s
'
report.  He said this:
"
People talk 
too
 loosely about closure.  They fail
to recognise that there can be 
no
 closure to love
 
and
nor 
should
 there be for someone you have loved and lost.
Furthermore, 
g
rief is a journey without a destination.
The bereaved travel through a landscape of memories and
thoughts of what might have been.  It is a journey
marked by milestones.  Some you seek, some you stumble
on.  For the families and survivors of Hillsborough,
these
 milestones have included 
the
 search for truth,
accountability
 
and justice but even these are not the
end of the road.  They are still travelling
, 
and this
report is another step along the way.
"
Thank you very much, all of you, and thank you,
Sir Brian.

Mr Snowden took on Tuesday
 
of identifying matters which
perhaps the lawyers weren't concerned about but the
clients were

too
.  Now, that was something that was specifically
mentioned to me when we were providing our

setting
out our response to recommendations.  And so what we
would say or rather what the Organisation would say is
particularly encapsulated in what Ms Francis and I wrote
at paragraph 262.  I say 
no
 more than that.
Haemophilia Centres -- I think my learned friend
Ms Gollop adopted that earlier, but it's -- if I ...
I can take it in more detail if you wish
 --

--Result #898--
 We're just going to have a look at that now.  035 7003, 
please, Henry. 
It says this -- we are not entirely sure of the 
date.  We can see it in the top right-hand corner, but 
it's not entirely clear what it is.  But the respon se is
this: 
"I am sorry to hear that Mrs Rankin's son has 
haemophilia and has been infected with hepatitis C.   On 
28 July last year, I announced the decision not to 
introduce a special payment scheme for people infec ted 
in this way.  Ministers do appreciate that they and
their families felt deep disappointment at the deci sion. 
I wrote to the Haemophilia Society explaining the  03 
reasons for this decision and stressing the particu larly 
careful consideration which had been given to all t he 
issues.
"The government's general policy is that 
compensation or other financial help to patients is  only 
given to patients when the NHS or individuals worki ng in 
it have been at fault.  After looking at a number o f 
different approaches to the question of special pay ments 
and thinking long and hard about the issues involve d, 
ministers decided that they could not make an excep tion 
to that general policy in the case of haemophiliacs
infected with hepatitis C.  The government is fundi ng 
a project, developed by the Haemophilia Society, wh ich 
aims to meet the advice and information needs of yo ung 
people with haemophilia who have been infected with
hepatitis C.  
"I hope that Mrs Rankin and her son will accept tha t 
the issues were very difficult in this case and tha t the 
most careful consideration was given to them." 
Then it notes you had been awarded the Disability 
Living Allowance.
What were your mum's thoughts about that response ?

--Result #899--
 "I have much sympathy with your comments and with  the 
points which the Society make.  As you may know, th e 
issue has already been ventilated in the House of L ords, 
where the minister explained that the government do es 
not accept liability for those infected by contamin ated 
blood products on the grounds that such patients 
received the best treatment available, given the me dical 
knowledge at that time. 52 
"Whilst a parallel can be drawn with those who 
contracted HIV, the minister claims that this was 
a special case, that the consequences are not compa rable 
and that agreeing to what would be in effect no-fau lt 
compensation could involve substantial expenditure,  not 
only for those cases, but for others of a similar n ature 
for which a precedent would have been created.
"However, having explained the government's stance,
I do accept that there is an argument for considera tion 
being given to ex gratia payments in certain cases and I 
shall seek opportunities to raise this in the House  of 
Commons or informally with ministers." 
So you were involved in trying to support a campaig n 
for payments for those who had been infected with 
hepatitis C.

--Result #900--

"Your patient is hepatitis C positive by 
a second generation test ... probably a chronic 
carrier of hepatitis C.  There is a slight risk of 
[transmission] ... increased risk of long-term live r 
disease such as chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis  or 
hepatoma ..."
So we've got there evidence, clearly, that 
testing was still being undertaken in relation to 
hepatitis C in the middle of 1993 and you will reca ll,
no doubt, from some of the oral evidence and the 
statements you have read that a number of individua ls 
have given evidence to the Inquiry that they were 
tested for hepatitis C without their knowledge and 
only informed of the position afterwards.
We don't have either, I'm afraid, a perfect 
picture or a complete picture of how many patients                                         
 were infected with HIV as a result of their treatme nt 
at Manchester Royal Infirmary. 
If we go to MRCO0000388_188, we see this is 
"Review of main UK cohorts of HIV seropositive case s 
by NHS region/district and main clinical centres", 
undertaken by Dr Philippa Easterbrook in July 1987.
And if we go to page -- I don't have numbered pages . 
Try page 17.  Yes, that's it. 
So:
"[North] Western Region.
"District ... [North] Manchester ..." 
If you look, sir, at the HIV positive, which is 
the third column in the table along, and then go do wn 
to where it says "Haemophilia Centre", you've got 
"?100[positive]/180/200".
Professor Hay's evidence was that his 
understanding was that 83 Manchester patients were 
infected with HIV, of whom 10 were under the age of
18, and that 186 were exposed to hepatitis C at som e 
time. 
So perhaps unsurprisingly, given that this was 
a very large clinic, a very large number of patient s 
infected with both HIV and hepatitis C. 
In terms of the treatment of patients with HIV,
again, sir, your best evidence is likely to be the  
138 accounts of the patients who were themselves infect ed 
as to how they were subsequently treated and what 
medications and other treatments they received. 
If we go to BPLL0002215 and go to the second 
page, this is the programme for a course that was h eld 
in January of 1988 at Manchester.  We don't 
unfortunately have any detail about the contents of
the course but we can see that information was bein g 
provided as to the present UK situation.  That's sa id 
to be by Dr Peter Jones.  There's said to have been
a presentation by Dr Gunson, "How safe are blood an d 
blood products?"  Dr Pinching, on "New approaches t o 
therapy", and then, under the chairmanship of 
Professor Bloom, in the afternoon, a session on 
counselling the patient, their sexual partner, the 
child and his parents by, respectively, Dr Kernoff,
Dr Morgan and Dr Evans (Dr Evans was the Manchester
Children's Hospital), and a discussion of "Insuranc e"
and "Psychosocial and psychiatric implications of H IV 
infection" by Dr Catalan, who I think was based in 
Oxford.
Then if we go to the next page, we can see 
reference there to the AIDS treatment centre as 
a topic, and then a closing session entitled, "An 
uncertain future?"  It's unfortunate, perhaps, that  we  
139 don't have more detail as to what actually was bein g 
said in particular about psychosocial and psychiatr ic 
implications. 
We've seen some evidence of the treatment of 
HIV positive patients being shared between the 
Manchester centre and other regional centres.  Ther e 
are, for example, interactions between Dr Newsome a t 
Blackburn and Dr Wensley in relation to an HIV 
positive patient, and their symptoms and their 
treatment.  The extent to which there was specialis t 
treatment rather than haematologists acting, as 
Dr Bevan put it in his statement, as  ad hoc  HIV 
specialists is unclear from the documentation, and we 
certainly see when Dr Lucas took over, in 1992 and 
1993, he is writing in relation to obtaining fundin g 
for HIV drugs and talking in brief terms about the 
treatment policy with respect to AZT in a way which
suggests that was certainly something in which the 
haematologists had substantial involvement. 
In relation to the treatment and care of 
patients with hepatitis.  From December '94 onwards ,
we've got the evidence of Professor Hay, which I wo n't 
repeat, and of course we have the evidence of the 
multiple patients treated or diagnosed with 
hepatitis C at Manchester.  
140 There is -- I think perhaps we'll go to the 
letter. 
If we go to an October 1990 letter -- just give 
me a moment while I get the reference.  WITN1577008 .
Go to the next page.  We'll see there -- again, thi s 
is in relation to an individual patient.  This 
October 1990.  It is a letter from Dr Wensley,
although the signature for some reason appears at t he 
top rather than the bottom of the letter.  It refer s 
to a referral to Dr Warnes in connection with the 
chronic liver problem and the possible of 
participating in a study of interferon that Dr Warn es 
was carrying out, and there is a detailed letter --
I won't take you to it -- setting out the outcome o f 
the referral.  So it would appear there is hepatolo gy 
involvement to some extent at least. 
If we -- sorry, Dr Lucas' statement to 
the Inquiry was to the effect that patients with 
hepatitis C who showed a deterioration in liver 
function or developed features of chronic liver 
disease would be referred to a hepatologist. 
It does appear that there may have been funding 
issues in relation to the treatment of haemophiliac s 
with hepatitis C in the Manchester area.  So if we go 
to DHSC0002545_070, we have a letter from Dr Lucas to                                         
 the Chief Medical Officer of the North West Regiona l 
Health Authority in September 93: 
"Chronic Hepatitis C Infection in 
Haemophiliacs.
"I thought I should write to you to flag out 
a health issue which relates to the past treatment of 
Haemophilia.  This is a potential litigation issue and 
(almost inevitably) the treatment involved is 
expensive.
"As a result of treatment with non-heat-treated 
blood products prior to 1985, many Haemophiliacs 
developed clinical jaundice or deranged liver funct ion 
tests, not associated with serological evidence of 
hepatitis A or ... B ('non-A, non-B hepatitis'). 
Recent technological advances have identified a new
virus, hepatitis C, for which serological screening
tests are available.  We have been screening our 
Haemophilia population and I can give you a break-d own 
of our results so far."
You can see there set out 113 out of 162 of 
hepatitis C positive patients, and then it sets out
the number who have deranged liver function tests, at 
the number who are also HIV positive is 48 as at th at 
stage. 
If we go over the page, he says this:  
142 "To summarise the problem, therefore, 
approximately 70 per cent of Haemophiliacs are 
hepatitis C positive C antibody positive, as a resu lt 
of hepatitis C infection transmitted by blood produ cts 
before 1985." 
Then he refers to a third having deranged liver 
function and he mentions one patient having receive d 
a liver transplant and two others both HIV positive
dying of liver failure. 
"There is genuine uncertainty about the natural 
history of hepatitis C infection and its best 
management."
Talks about long-term studies.  
"... the probability of developing clinical 
liver failure among those who survive for 15 years 
after hepatitis C infection is about 20 per cent.  The 
experience of colleagues (and my own experience)
suggests that this risk is considerably higher wher e 
there is concomitant HIV infection. 
"There is considerable uncertainty about the 
best management of patients with hepatitis C 
infection."
And then he talks about an editorial advocating 
interferon and then says this: 
"This editorial, however, makes it clear that  
143 the long-term benefits of such treatment with Alpha
interferon remains unproven."
He refers to biopsies prior to treatment with 
interferon and the costs associated with that. 
And then at the bottom of the page says that:
"From discrete sounding out of The Haemophilia 
Society, I think it is very likely that they will 
start to campaign in the relatively near future for
compensation for hepatitis C infection and also for
its active treatment."
Over the page he says:
"In view of this, I feel that it is vital that 
the problem is actively managed.  I would find it 
extremely valuable if a Regional Policy or consensu s 
statement could be formulated, enabling me, for 
example, to approach purchasers for the 
not-inconsiderable costs."
Then in his statement Dr Lucas said the purpose 
of this letter was to make clear his feeling that 
there was a need for a national or at least regiona l 
policy for the management of hepatitis C infection 
caused by the use of infected blood products.  He 
doesn't recall receiving a response to this, and th en 
he ceased to be acting director the following year.

   Well, I mean, maybe I should declare 
a slight conflict of interest at the very end here 
because I think I graduated from medicine in 1988 a nd 
I looked after patients with haemophilia.  I was in
a hospital which was a major haemophilia treatment 
centre and also a major HIV treatment centre, and 
I looked after patients who died of AIDS and who ha d 
HIV from blood products.  You know, I know firsthan d 
that, at that time, I think in our hospital, patien ts  
198 got the best possible care but many people, many 
clinicians, including myself, often were embarrasse d 
or ashamed and we viewed patients with haemophilia as 
a failure of medicine. 
We had promised miracles and given them HIV and 
for that, you know, as a part of the medical 
profession I would like to apologise.  I can't say 
anything about the decisions of Sir Brian but I do 
hope that you get the justice and compensation that
you deserve and I hope that we can move forward int o 
the future and identify the ethical failings and do
better in the future. 
So I look forward to Sir Brian's report and 
I hope to write about this in the future.

--Result #902--
 -- my ramblings.  Firstly, I'd like to thank 
Sir Brian and all the Inquiry team for the opportun ity 
to have our experiences, shall we put them, heard. 
I would also like to thank all the staff at 
Collins solicitors because I believe without their 
tenacity I fear this Inquiry might never had got to
where it is.  I would just like to relay, having 
already seen and heard because this has been going on 
a long time, some of the excuses of the scandal 
publicly aired by the professions.  I would just li ke 
to clarify some what I call disseminated opinions. 
I want to start with the definition of 
an accident.  That is it is an unfortunate incident     111 that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, 
typically resulting in damage or injury.  That's th e 
definition.  Even the limited witness statements an d 
evidence gathered to date I think we can quite safe ly 
say I don't think there was anything unintentional or 
unexpected that happened here.  So I proffer that 
anyone that puts forward the word "accident" in 
defence of this just wasn't worthy to hold a post t hat 
they had, whether it be consultant, minister or civ il 
servant. 
Next you would be the knowledge.  Classic 
statement, "We didn't know about these viruses".  Y ou 
know, it is documented evidence in the '70s and '80 s. 
You only have to go on Google and look at the 
journals.  The proof was there.  Academics were 
forewarning of problems with pooled blood, hepatiti s. 
There is only one group of people in my opinion 
who were truly unaware of the consequences of plasm a 
products and pooled products and that was us, the 
patients.  Any of these people, if they were given 
half of the knowledge available at the time, and I am 
saying at the time, they would have declined that 
treatment. 
"We didn't realise non-A non-B, which is now hep 
C, was anything other than benign."     112 Well, if this is a true statement, why were 
these pharmaceuticals and research programmes throw ing 
money and money and money to isolate the virus, 
establish a test, studying the observable recorded 
liver abnormalities, this is research documents tha t 
people can see.  It is just a lie.  It is just not 
true. 
Another classic is most haemophiliacs would have 
died, you know, before their 20s without any 
treatment.  It is not true.  I was 10 years old. 
I could have gone on to 30 years old, 40 years old,
with a bit of ice, a bag of peas.  That's what I ha d 
before.  I have never had and I don't think most mi ld 
haemophiliacs will have ever had a life saving 
treatment.  I have certainly had a life altering 
treatment, but never a lifesaving one. 
Finally, I will just briefly touch on this,
no-one wants to discuss it.  It is the one thing th at 
threads the scandal together.  The source of the 
plasma, the import and export agents, the customs, the 
drug agencies, the pharmaceutical companies, the 
governments, the ministers, the hospitals and now u s 
the victims is the money. 
True compensation doesn't need to be complicated 
and the finance people who are made to pay      113 compensation through authorities are making it 
complicated because they can. 
I don't want another tailored round much 
schemes.  I am sick of schemes.  Schemes ain't goin g 
to help me.  Means testing isn't going to help me. 
The means testing they had didn't even truly means 
test.  They didn't measure your income to your 
outgoings.  Theyy just went, "You were earning that
much.  You are not getting it". 
I don't want any more discrimination of virus 
types and manipulated virus stages.  These are just
tried and tested tactics, divide and conquer.  We k now 
them. 
Any payments that are made, if any, if Sir Brian 
can get these governments to come to the table and 
make payments, they need to be paid to all 
haemophiliacs, all those affected, those that have 
died, they shouldn't be ignored.  They don't deserv e 
no money.  It's got to go to their widow or their 
estate and that includes people who were consequent ly 
infected as well by haemophiliacs.  I think that's 
about all I need to say.

--Result #903--
 Means testing.  What has my wife's income got to do
with the fact that I am again a haemophiliac, who i s 
HIV positive, who is hep C positive and CJD positiv e?
It's got nothing to do with my wife.  Why should sh e 
have less money -- what they are saying is, "Your w ife 
can pay the money that we would pay you.  So go to her 
and ask her for about £250 a month that we used to pay 
you under the old scheme, because she earns too muc h 
to give you it.  So just get £250,000 a month from 
her, will you?" 
So if you think about this in practice, you 
know -- I won't get into the nitty-gritty of my 
marital financial arrangements -- but in practice 
again it's a simple thing, isn't it?  If it were al l 
cash, you'd go to your wife and say, "Oh, you know you 
were having that spa treatment and that night out w ith 
the girls and movie night?  Well, you're not anymor e, 
because you have got to give me now £250 because 
they're not giving me it.  So you have to have 
a lesser lifestyle to look after me, this guy who h as 
been a burden on you for the last 35 years of your 
life".6 Now I am a bigger burden.  I am a financial 
burden.  Why?  Why is it?  Then the EIBSS have the 
nerve -- how they have the information I don't know
but they say, "Oh, by the way we have looked up.  Y ou 
are now getting a special category mechanism paymen t, 
aren't you? 
So you are actually, financially, you are 
significantly better off than you were under the ol d 
scheme when we kind of aggregated all your payments ". 
I said, "Yes, because I am a lot damn sicker than 
I was to qualify for that special category mechanis m 
payment.  It is not something you have just decided  to 
give me.  I had to go through another load of hoops  to 
get that and you rejected that the first time".  It  is 
just bizarre. 
The thing is they all call it, you know, 
assistance, entitlements, benefit.  We all think it
should be compensation, but it is not compensation and 
it should be compensation.  It's been a tough 30-od d 
years living with this.  It is not our fault and we
are actually made to feel like beggars panhandling our 
way through life and the way you are treated -- aga in,
right now I have just qualified for some -- for tra vel 
costs to go to hospital.  Now, I hadn't applied for
this before, because, again, it is another type of7 discretionary payment.  It is in the booklet but th ere 
is two types of discretionary payment.  God knows w hy. 
This one -- so I said -- I mean, they were 
pestering me for two years to apply for this 
discretionary payment that I didn't qualify for. 
I told them on the phone "I have looked at your 
booklet.  I don't qualify for it." 
"Oh, apply anyway", they said.  They were really 
touchy-feely on the phone.  "We need to know how th e 
community is affected by our new rules.  Would he w ant 
your feedback".  I said, "Okay.  I am not going to 
fill it in because I don't qualify.  I am not going  to 
get a load of pay slips but I'll send it in".  They
said, "Send us a covering letter.  Explain your 
circumstances.  It has been very interesting talkin g 
to you, Mr [redacted].

--Result #904--
 No, it's all right.7 You know, just going back to what I was saying 
about, you know, what's gone on over the years and 
I think, you know, it's been 33 years from the date
from when I was infected with HIV, 39 years from my
first hepatitis infection and, as far as I'm 
concerned, the Government has been given far too lo ng 
avoiding paying proper compensation for killing peo ple 
and ruining people's lives and prospective careers and 
just wrecking your life.
I know the Inquiry's going to be two years but,
you know, it's just going to be another two years o f 
being tormented, you know.  Department of Health ha ve 
everybody in the palm of their hand with the fundin g 
and these schemes and stuff like that, where they 
haven't come out and guarantee anything, you know.  As 
far as I'm concerned, they can pull it off us if th ey 
wanted to and what would we do then?
As far as I'm concerned the buck stops with the 
Government and it's time they acknowledged this by 
admitting liability.  There's enough proof out ther e 
now that this should never have happened, any of it . 
That's basically it. 
I'd like to thank Sir Brian and the Inquiry team 
for the opportunity to do this, and Collins for 
getting us to this point and all the support they g ive8 us.  Without them, we would all still be at home 
kicking the cat!  Not really, not really!

 The way that came about was I was in the car and I was 
driving through -- the time it was in -- I just 
flicked on Radio 4.  I don't know what the programm e 
was, it just mentioned the fact that there had been
an agreement with the Government for HIV people tha t3 passed away and the families that there was 
a compensation order out, and I thought, "Oh, that 
will give me a chance, if I can get anything, to ge t 
back on my feet", because, like I said, I lost 
absolutely everything. 
So what I done, I phoned up the solicitors that 
I had in Manchester previous and it was a Mr Morton
came on the phone and he said straightaway, he said ,
"I'm glad you've got back in touch [Mr W], I will d ig 
your files out, but I can't see any problems", and 
I went, "Yeah, okay then".  The next thing I got 
a letter from him saying, "Yes, there is compensati on 
available, but you'll have to sign a waiver to say 
that you won't bother the National Health people ag ain 
with regards to your wife's case", and of course 
I wasn't -- I thought, well, if I can get some mone y 
back, you can out it down on maybe a little propert y 
and get stuck into that and that will keep us busy and 
give us a bit of security back.  So I did, I signed
a waiver and a few weeks later there was a cheque c ame 
back through the door, and I don't mind saying what  it 
was for if you need to know. 

--Result #906--
 I think that I do feel actually guilty that I've 
dragged, you know, the people around me who have lo ved 
me into, you know, me doing almost like a headless 
chicken, pursuing what I did do without any guidanc e 
or advice as to -- nobody to say, well, hang on,
perhaps you should think about this, with 
justification, perhaps, because we were always hopi ng 
for some compensation and also for some truth, whic h 
might have affected my decision. 
So in a way I've just ploughed on over the years 
and dragged the people around me with me and I susp ect 
that, you know, hindsight that's been fairly 
selfish -- not deliberate -- by the way it's been a nd 
I have some regrets on that.

--Result #907--
 You said in your statement he had to give up all 
opportunity to claim for any other compensation in the 
future?

--Result #908--
 Yes, that was a requirement of accepting the mone y 
from the Macfarlane Trust, which was purported to b e 
a no fault compensation scheme, that they had to 
actually sign that you wouldn't sue for anything el se 
no matter what arose and, as time goes by, it becam e 
obvious that that was hepatitis B and hepatitis C i n 
addition to HIV. 
The other thing that upset me really was,
I mean, as I mentioned, we were lucky, well, in a w ay,
lucky in that he happened just to have turned 16 wh en 
the mass -- the mass action was proposed and becaus e 
he was 16, he could apply for Legal Aid because the re 
was always a risk that you might be required to pay
legal fees or the costs of the action.  That was on e 
potential outcome and he could apply for Legal Aid so 
that was not a worry to us.  All we had to pay was 
a small amount of money as his what they call best6 friend. 
But then because he was young he got £20,000 
which I always thought was -- I mean, I appreciate 
that people with families and -- spouses and famili es,
would merit more because but just being under 21 it
seemed to me to be very poor value on life really a nd 
I think for people with even younger children I thi nk 
their awards were very, very small, which just seem ed 
to be an inappropriate valuation of somebody's life
and a person of Alistair's age, 22, could 
reasonably -- should really have been able to expec t 
to have a potential wife or family in the future an d 
I didn't see why they thought he was less valuable 
because he happened to be younger. 

--Result #909--
 Yes.  They asked for a note to say that we wouldn 't 
pursue any legal action if I accepted the money and ,
at the time, money was really very tight, to say th e 
least.  We'd got into a bit of debt.  I'd borrowed 
money off of my family and even a friend, and we ha d 
to freeze the mortgage because I wasn't working and ,
you know, there was no income, really.
So it was seen at the time as a bit of 
a lifeline to get into The Eileen Trust to be accep ted 
and then they gave us compensation on the law of      127 probabilities because they couldn't trace -- well, 
they said they couldn't trace the blood.  Sorry, ha ve 
I drifted off there into --

 In about 2002 you think your Mum applied for mone y 
from the Skipton fund and, again, in her records 
there's a letter from Professor Ludlam to her GP 
saying your Mum had been to see him and she had bee n 
told by the Scottish Office that compensation would
only be given if infection occurred after March 198 8. 
Were you aware of that at the time?  

--Result #911--
 Which was the recommendation that those who 
subsequently suffer serious deterioration in their 
physical condition because of the hepatitis C 
infection, cirrhosis, liver cancer or other similar
serious conditions should be entitled to full 
compensation calculated on the same basis as common
law damages. 

--Result #912--
 Yes, I do.  If it's okay with you if I can read. 
There's actually three points that I want.
First, I want to speak about the infected and 
affected, then with reference to the NHS staff, and      42 finally to the Inquiry team yourselves. 
The first thing I would like to say is that the 
infected and affected are experts in understanding the 
impact of NHS policies.  They know the NHS truth an d 
how they truthfully operate.  Our knowledge is vast
and it should be valued.  The Scottish Government i n 
2020 in their vision for health and care strategy 
stated that by 2020 every person in Scotland is giv en 
the best standard of care with the patient at the 
centre of all decisions. 
When is our community going to see this 
person-centred care?
With regard to the NHS staff, I would like to 
see teaching in medical schools and the ongoing 
training in hospitals for consultants.  It must 
change.  I want change.  Doctors have no God-given 
right to hold all the power.  These last 30 years 
since I was infected were made much worse by the ab use 
of power by doctors and nursing staff when I was at  my 
most vulnerable and my weakest state.
If I can turn to the Inquiry team, I wish to 
raise two points with you, Sir Brian, and your team . 
Firstly, I would like you to consider how you inten d 
to record silence in testimonies.  When the depth o f 
suffering is so great that all language fails and w hat3 we recognise is that the pause is as valuable in 
conveying the trauma as the spoken word.  This is v ery 
important for future researchers who will study the
final report in generations to come. 
My second point is how will the Inquiry team 
quantify the loss of potential.  How can you,
Sir Brian, and your team really establish the scale  of 
loss for the infected and affected that you are so 
keen to put first. 
To demonstrate what I mean, I was infected when 
I was 29 years of age and most people here know wha t 
stage they were at in their careers at 29.  I want to 
give you two examples.  At 29 years of age John Maj or 
with no university education and working for Standa rd 
Chartered would take another eight years to become 
a Government minister.  Nicola Sturgeon at 29 was 
a young solicitor.  What compensation would they be
seeking today if they had been infected at 29 years  of 
age and their political ambitions had been destroye d. 
I hope these examples focus the Inquiry team's and the 
public's minds on what it truly means to lose your 
career, your health and your financial security. 
Thank you very much.
